# Project Description
=====

## The Vision
``````
The objective of this first project is to allow the students to use
all the skills they've acquired in the data science bootcamp into 
practice. 
``````

## The Objective
``````
Find, clean, analyze and present the answers to a series of questions
that each student has to come up with. There is no limitation on the
type of questions or data that can be used/presented, but the student 
has to be aware of the fact they will present their discoveries to all
the class (and they will be filmed) so it is urged to avoid using private
data.
``````

## Technical Requirements
``````
- The student has to use the Pandas lybrary to perform ETL operations on the raw data
- The student needs to use Jupyter Notebooks to perform Data Mining and ETL (import pandas here)
- The student has to create 6-8 data visualizations (ideally, at least 2 per "question" you are asking) using Matplotlib
- Save the data visualizations as PNGs that will be used in the student's presentation.
- Create and present the summary of your findings. (This should include a heading for each "question" asked, and a short description of each insight found)
- (Optional) The student can use a external API websource to find/download data for their project.

``````

## Presentation Requirements/Specifications
``````
- The each group will have 10 minutes to present their findings. 
- The presentation can be delivered by 1 or more members of each team.
- The presentation will be filmed, so appropriatate attire is recommended.
- The presentation must cover the following points:
    1. Present explain what questions were analyzed in the project & why they were chosen.
    2. Explain where you found the data and how you acquired your data.
    3. Use your Jyputer Notebook to guide the audience on your data exploration process. What/Where/How/Why
    4. Present your Conclusions & Insights. (This should include a numerical summary as well as visualizations of that summary)
    5. Discuss the implications of your findings to generate an open-ended discussion about their meaning.
