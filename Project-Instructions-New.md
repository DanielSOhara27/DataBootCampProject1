# Updated Project Description
=====

## The Vision
``````
The objective of this 2nd project is to allow the students to use
all the skills they've acquired in the data science bootcamp into 
practice - This time, we will focus on story telling like a true
Data Scientist.

## The Objective
``````
Unlike the first part of the project, where you were focused on 
using the "Analytics Paradigm" to explore relationships in a 
"Report Form", THIS PROJECT should be more focused on providing
users an interactive means to explore the data themselves 
``````
