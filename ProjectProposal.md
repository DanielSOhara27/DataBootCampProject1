### Project Description
````
In order to better understand customer behavior, expectations and levels of satisfaction 
we are analyzing 3 different datasets concerning product reviews. 
````

### Project Outline
````
For phase 1, we are analazying all three datasets sepparately from each other and we are 
perfroming the same data exploration and mining processes on all three. For this part we
are simply trying to get a general overview of what kind of responses we can find on the 
datasets; we are also getting some simple insights into what makes each dataset unique.

### Datasets Used

For this project we found 3 different datasets:

1) Amazon Product Reviews Generic (https://www.kaggle.com/jiajinliang/200000-amazon-reviews/version/1)

4) This is an optional dataset - Amazon Reviews for Sentinment Analysis (https://www.kaggle.com/bittlingmayer/amazonreviews)
````

### Tasks
````
1) Get Raw Data 
2) Explore all 3 datasets to find similarities and dimensions that can be used to cross-match them
3) Clean all 3 datasets and add new dimensions (positive, negative, positive-happy, negative-happy, positive-angry, negative-angy, positive-sad, negative-sad, etc)
5) Answer the following questions for each dataset:
5a) What is the distribution of the data? How are the ratings handled? (point-based, star-based, etc)
