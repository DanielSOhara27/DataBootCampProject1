Then the band that goes across your rib cage gets bunched up and twisted and it diggs into your skin. I am always having to go into the bathroom and pull it down or readjust during the day. Also the cup is shaped like a cone under your shirt ( SO NOT NATURAL LOOKING AT ALL) Also the cone shaped cup material ruchees from the nipple up to the arm strap after you have been waering it awhile. This product is not worth your money. Mine went to the goodwill.

I am on my feet just about 50 hours a week and these are very good at handling the tile floor. There not a tennis shoes but do great they usually last me about 6 months and I have to replace!.

And while I love my Birks, I needed a strap on the back because I couldn't really walk properly. So I tried these. They are so incredibly comfortable when you put them on! The shiny patent leather strap is a bit unnerving, but then it looks really cute! The strap does not rub on my ankle at all, and even though the front pushes into the top of my foot (my shin? ankle?) it doesn't hurt at all. No rubbing. And I do not care for flip flops because I hate the strap between the two toes, but I don't mind these at all!

As others have stated, the top consists of a separate tank and sweater combination. The sweater is made of a knit fabric, and is much better quality than expected (although I haven't washed it yet so don't know how it will perform). Of course, it's all plastic for the price, and yes it does smell funny when it first comes out of the package, but nothing a wash or a night in fresh air won't fix. It fits true to size for me and is very, very flattering. Looks super stylish with some faux leather leggings and boots or booties. Glad I purchased this."

They are adorable. They fit my relatively large calf with ease, which is something I struggled with at other stores like Target, JCP, and Old Navy. I ordered a size up to accommodate thicker socks, and they fit perfectly. My only complaint is that my feet get a little sore after I walk on hard surfaces for hours on end because the sole seems fairly thin and has little padding. But what can you do?

You normally get what you pay for. I paid under a dollar for this ring, but it looks like I paid over $25, at least. I was pleasantly shocked when I received it and I couldn't be more thrilled with this ring. I wear it every day. I wash my hands a lot and always leave the ring on and it still hasn't turned my finger green. I get compliments everywhere I go. My family even asked me if I had gotten engaged! The picture does not do this ring justice. It's absolutely stunning and you won't regret buying it. It also comes in an adorable little blue box with a silver ribbon.

I have a slight issue with my pinky toes getting squished and have to adjust and readjust when first putting the heels on.  But once my feet are in there comfortably, I feel good in them.  I don't wear them often, so perhaps that issue will resolve itself with more use and the shoe/cushion conforms more to my foot.

I'll have to see what Santa says!For the price, they are a generous size, but the color shown in the picture and the description of aquamarine confused me. The earrings have the blue tint on the back but the front shines clear with a tint of pinky-coral in the middle. It's actually very striking because they'll go with a lot of colors.

I wear them out on rainy days too and have never had a problem with my feet getting wet. These are great. They tend to run a tad large. So, if you're an 8 1/2 but really closer to an 8 be sure to order the 8 for a good fit and I would think if you're a true size such as 8 1/2 but your foot is quite narrow you'd want one half size down to 8 as well."

I decided to give these sandals a try based on Dunham's reputation and the reviews others posted.They are well-made: reinforced seams, solid foot-bed, quality materials. I especially liked the outsole, suitable for carpeted and wood floors (the only place my sandals see) but with treads to handle outdoor surfaces, too. Unfortunately for me, the sandal is made for a lower instep (i.e., flatter foot) and I have a higher instep. The sandal vamp was too tight; I couldn't insert my foot fully into the sandal without jamming and wiggling it. I also found the insole insufficiently supportive.More's the pity...I really hoped these would work for me."

It is NOT as water proof as they claim.  I have to wash my hands carefully so I don't get it wet, or take it off every time.  I wash my hands often for allergy and hygiene reasons.Upon getting wet, it glitches up - forcing me to take the back off of it to let it dry for at least 24 hours or more.  Which means I'm without it for the entire time it takes to dry out, I depend on this watch too much to be ""ok"" with it glitching up after a few drops of water come in contact with it.I had cheaper watch than this and I NEVER had water proof problems with the cheaper one at all.  This $27+ watch has been a real problem!2. The original wrist band it comes with is a canvas type of material that broke my wrist out - tried it on both wrist and got the same result.I can to have the wrist band completely replaced with a leather one - an extra expense I had not counted on.Bottom line, when I buy something it better do what it says it does!

After wearing Croc Classic Sandals for 3 years then the Crocs Yukon sport for the last 4 months I will never go back after trying on and subsequently purchasing these shoes.  It was a no brainer.  The Crocs caused excessive wear on one side of the sole due to pronation of my feet when walking and lead to chronic pain in my knees.  The podiatrist attributed it to the spongy material used in Crocs.  They also shocked me regularly when getting out of my car due to their isolating properties that cause you to build up static electricity.  These shoes immediately eliminated most of the discomfort in my knees the first time I tried them on.  I could feel the pressure redistribute evenly in my joints and not hurt anymore in one direct spot.  I've not noticed getting shocked once yet like I did wearing Crocs.  These are very light shoes with a flat sole yet remarkably shock absorbing.  Probably the most comfortable shoe I've ever worn.  They feel like they are already broke in the minute you put them on.  This will be my choosen brand in the future.

I had a tendency to walk right out of them. I have a pair of Acorn spa thong slippers that I love in spring, but needed a pair that would work either with bare feet or heavy socks. The footbed is very soft and well-cushioned, and it's stable. I tried on many pairs of foam-soled slippers and found that most of them caused my feet to tilt off to one side or the other, making them really unstable for walking around the house. My feet sit flat and centered on these.They have a non-slip rubber outsole and I'm pleased that the &#34;teeth&#34; on the velcro are on the lower flap, where it won't snag on my socks. Barefoot, I wear them with the tabs fully overlapped, as shown in the picture. They fit snugly. I have narrow (A) feet and find it especially nice that even with my legs crossed and one foot dangling, they stay secure. Barefoot, I wear them with the tabs fully overlapped, as shown in the photo. I adjust it out a bit for socks, and it stays where I place it. If they do stretch out, I can adjust them to fit tighter.I wear a size 10 and ordered the large in French Blue, which I'm happy to say is not as bright as shown. They're just a teensy bit shorter than I'd prefer, but overall are preferable to a pair that's too large, as the XL would be. I've got about 1/4&#34; clearance at both toe and heel, adequate but not ideal. I'm ordering a pair in size XL for my mother, who wears a size 11 AA. She'll be thrilled to have slippers that don't fall off her feet.Overall, these are well-designed slippers. Highly recommend."

I've tried on white and colored tight tanktops and they don't show, they work great for white blouses and dresses as well. These pads are made of really soft silicone (as soft as my boobs) and are translucent so they are not visible under light colored clothing. The center of these covers are slightly over 1/8"" thick (my personal guess) and taper towards the edge so you can't see them at all even under tighter clothing.

I wear them everyday for work where I spend most of my time on the move, and they have remained comfortable.  If they don't feel nice at first make sure you give them break in time.. mine went from pain to perfection.  This specific pair is not even close in size though.  They were supposed to be 10 but fit like 11, and were 2E that fit like 4E.  The replacement pair fit better but weren't perfect, so consider ordering a half size smaller at least?Being that they are tennis shoes, there is a ton of surface area that grips pretty well and they are very light weight.  The material seems to be good quality, as I haven't scuffed or torn them (I'm brutal on my shoes at work).  I like them specifically because they have the reinforced rubber at the front of the toe.  For the price I paid, they cannot be beat.  Are they worth MSRP?  Absolutely not.. in my opinion.  I'd say they are a decent mid range every day shoe but certainly not what New Balance used to be..My 3 star review is for the lack of support, sizing inconsistencies, and lack of stability compared to the previous model.EDIT:  After 3 months of every day use, these are beginning to fall apart.  I understand that they are designed for tennis, not every day use.. but I still expected them to hold up better.  The liners are wore out leaving virtually no padding.  The material has stretched a bit, making it difficult to maintain a consistent fit as well.  Lowered to a 2/5 star product, but still may perform better if used strictly for tennis."

Very comfortable overall, fitted but not too tight. Stretchy and soft.SIZING:I purchased a large which fits me very nicely. I have a statuesque type shape/figure-- 5'7, 188lb (I probably &#34;look&#34; more like 158 just because of my even/curvy proportion) I carry most of my weight in my chest and butt/thighs. I do have a bit of a &#34;pudge&#34;, lol, which should, no I'll say &#34;will&#34;... which will be gone by the end of the month with all the kickboxing I'm doing :-).  The waist of the pants is starting to get a little loose b/c of the working out, but the legs still fit very well. I will be down a few more pounds by next week so I'm a little worried that they may end up being too loose in the waist. I do wish there was a drawstring on the inside, that would make these leggings perfect.WORKING OUT:These are very comfortable during the workout. They certainly keep me cool, the absorb sweat okay.SUMMARY:For the price these are good quality. Champion makes pretty good products in general, I have a few of their sports bras that I picked up from tjmaxx which fit well. If you are on the hunt for several pair of new workout leggings like I was I say give them a try."

Not necessarily a bad thing but, with my extreme pronation, the arch broke down and my heel tended to hang off the outside edge.

Wow! I consider myself pretty savvy with men's clothes shopping, and I am astounded at the price. If you need a camel full-length coat, get this one. But, with a HUGE caveat... As others have described, THIS COAT IS MASSIVE if you buy your normal size.  I regularly purchase size 42L suits and overcoats just a bit bigger so I can wear the coat over the suit. Simple, normal, and usual. However, the best advice I read about the London Fog is to PURCHASE A SIZE SMALLER than you otherwise would. I bought a 40L to cover my 42L suit, and IT WORKS perfectly!A few helpful lessons for Amazon that may make shopping for a topcoat or overcoat MUCH easier for its customers.First, use a real model.  No manniquins, displays on a hanger, or laying on furniture. People wear coats, people are not hangers.Second, show the ENTIRE coat.  Do not cut off the photo at the knee.  If you are looking for a full length coat, you need to see how far from the ankles it falls.Third, open the coat.  Show the lining, and detail whether or how well it fits over a suit.Fourth, if it's designed for a slim, portly, or athletic/muscular build, say so. Some coats are shapeless, other are tailored to a slim body. Let us know.Fifth, assume the top coat will go on TOP of a suit, and this overcoat will go OVER a suit, so display sizes and fit accordingly.These steps will save consumers time, reduce returns, and create repeat customers."

She was appalled that I had been spending my days braless. Well that was 5 months ago and since then I have been wearing them nearly daily.Until recently they had been doing okay.  I too noticed the fraying issue at the band.  Also the support isn't as much as I'd like.  They're up but not too much more than when they're free. I'm fairly big busted, 38 D/DD.A few weeks ago I started noticing that I was falling out of them all the time.  I'd be doing something and I'd suddenly notice one of the girls had escaped. Well I'm afraid it's time for some new ones. In fairness perhaps 5 months is just their shelf life but I'm still bummed.

Many girls get a nice round shape with this bra, so I think the cone shape wouldn't be a problem as long as you got a large enough cup size.  I tried at 30GG and 30H.  Perhaps the 30J would work, but I think it would still dig into the top of my breasts and would then be too big at the bottom of the cup.  My best fitting bra is the Freya Deco in a 30GG, although the cups are a little small at the top but perfect for creating cleavage.  The freya deco is known for being best for breasts with a lot of upper fullness.  I think the Cleo Lucy is not good for very full breasts and would work better with normal to bottom heavy breasts.  The bra itself is made well and while the fabric is not very soft, it seems like the type that would soften over time.  If the fit had worked for me, I would have given it a shot to see if the fabric would soften after a few wears and washes."

It fit comfortably and was neither too lose nor too tight on me--the shirt is nice, thick, and doesn't feel cheap at all. Although I haven't worn it for long, the quality of the shirt and cape feel like they will last for a long time. I wore it to two Halloween parties in 2 weeks and got a lot of compliments on it, especially on the slightly glittery logo (just the red part of the S, the yellow and black are a matte print). The cape is a bit more stretchy and thin (100% polyester) and stays on well. Although it's not pictured, there is also a Superman symbol on the cape as well (matte yellow with a black outline).One small complaint is that the sewing was a little bit sloppy on the corner of my cape and there were some long strands hanging off (about 1.5&#34; worth), but I just tied it off and trimmed it to keep the seam intact.I washed the shirt (not the cape, as it wasn't particularly dirty and I was unsure how it would hold up in the wash) in the washing machine per the case instructions (cold water with like colors [I just put it with my darks]) and it held up well. While the instructions say to tumble dry low, I prefer to hang-dry my shirts with graphic prints (i.e. the S symbol and belt) to maintain the original color as much as possible--I've found that machine drying them can sometimes make very small fibers of the fabric of the shirt (in this case, blue) stick to the printed parts (e.g. yellow belt).In sum, the cape tee I got was great: it was comfortable, fit well (if you order a size up), and the quality of the shirt is great. It'll probably be my back-up Halloween costume for a long time. :)"

They are comfortable but need more arch support.  I like that they are machine washable and don't get any funky smells but there is no arch support.  I currently am using Orthaheel slides, which have a lot of arch support but are not washable and start to smell when worn constantly.I was recently diagnosed with plantar fascitis and heel spurs on the backs and bottoms of both heels.  Never had foot problems ever, until all of a sudden I started having issues one day and it progressed to barely being able to walk.  So now I have to wear my Orthaheel slippers constantly while in the house. I am 38 years old and have high arches.I like the Acorn thong slipper better for the price, comfort and being able to wash them.  Just wish these had more arch support.PLEASE READ - UPDATE:  4/27/14My Orthaheel slippers started to stink so bad so I decided to throw them away and went back to these Acorn thong slippers.  Again, they feel wonderful, I love the price as compared to Orthaheel, but still no arch support.  On day 1 of wearing these, I broke the pinky toe on my left foot.  I was walking in the house and was walking by a leather ottoman.  My left foot or should I say pinky toe caught the ottoman and I heard a cracking noise at the same time.  At first I thought it was just me being clumsy until I really looked at where my toes sit in these Acorn slippers.  There is no buffer around the edges of these slippers to prevent accidents like this.  I don't have wide feet at all and wear medium width shoes.  Orthaheel slippers have this important factor and would have prevented the breaking of my toe as my toe would have never even touched the ottoman.

They pull on pretty easily with slight difficulty pulling over the heel--expected considering there is no zipper or buckle. In terms of the sole, I think the width is good, only slightly snug in the length.I am 5'8"" with fairly slim calves for my height; the boots fit well with enough room for socks or skinny pants while still getting the slouchy look. The tops of the boots come over the knee covering just to the top of the knee cap. The fit allows easy knee bending, but these are not made to be folded over at the top like some boots with the slit in the back of the knee. Instead there is a V-cut with elastic for maneuverability.In general I am very happy with the purchase.  The material is soft and they have a good fit. For extended wear I definitely recommend some sort of insole because there is no arch support and the curvature along the inside of the foot isn't very fitted for comfort. I probably wouldn't recommend theses for walking on slick surfaces such as ice; the bottom of the sole is very smooth and mostly treadless.  In every other way I think they're great and very versatile as well as warm."

My son is five, 49 inches, and 52 pounds and the size 8 just fits him - so the shirt is cut on the small side.  He usually wears a size six in clothes.  The shirt is light enough in color to not absorb the hot sun but dark enough to not show any discoloration from the salt water or pool water.  The shirt has a slight mock turtle collar, which allows for a bit of his neck to be covered.  He feels comfortable in the shirt and it dries quickly.  The only other issue besides it being on the small side is that the little picture on the front is half peeled off after less than a month of wear.  I would recommend this shirt for affordable sun coverage."

I bought them at about the same time, but the first one was a gift for a Godchild whose Birthday is in March. I liked it so well, that I ordered another for myself. I got mine (the two of them) in Feb and March of 2011.I do not know how the one for my Godchild fared. She is quite polite and would not tell me even if the stones on her charm fell out. That being said:I have worn mine on and off for a year. Sometimes it is on a bracelet I wear for a couple of weeks, and sometimes it gets thrown in the box with my other blue beads. In December, it goes on a bracelet and is worn almost all month as that is my Birthday Month.I have had no trouble with it. The stones are intact and the silver patina has not worn off.BUT HERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT PUGSTER. Up until this date, they have not issued sterling charms, so the charms of their's that are silver are silver plate...and at some point, that silver will wear off. But they generally do a good job with their plated items and the plating is as good as anyone elses. Also Pugster carries a full range of charms, some good and some not so good. They may have one charm that looks the same as the next one, but one will cost about five dollars, the next will be 10 and the next 20. At first I was very confused by this. BUT...the quality goes up with the price. Sometimes it is difficult to tell by price alone, BUT AGAIN, after much reckoning with this, I discovered that the shipping cost is the give away for the value of the item.Shipping costs for Pugster: If the shipping cost is below $3.25, you are buying a piece of junk. It may be pretty and even last a long time, but it is made of inferior materials and ""is just for little kids"" or something like that. Their next level of shipping is $3.25. This is assigned to their lowest grade of acceptable charms. I never expect these charms to be perfect. You do not pay much and you do not get much. Sometimes you get a really good deal, but I would not count on it. Then, I think the next shipping level is about $6. Now you are into charms that are about twenty dollars and you should expect them to hold up. They go up from there. I have noticed that Pugster has started carrying some more expensive charms...IN THE 30 DOLLAR AND ABOVE RANGE...this was in late 2011. I have not purchased any, but my experience says they should be good.In general, with Pugster, the more the charm, the more the shipping cost, the better the product. They do have some inferior ones, but they do carry better ones also, so Pugster is just one of those companies where you have to know the product in order to decide whether you are getting a good deal.Picture charms: When I first started doing bracelets, Pugster was the only company that made charms with pictures. If I had a bracelet and really wanted to brighten it up, I would get a Pugster Picture Charm. They have thousands. OR THEY WILL TAKE YOU PHOTO AND MAKE A CHARM OF IT.  Here is an example with one of their stock photos.Pugster Pandora Style Bead Hummingbird Photo Beads Fits Pandora Bracelet NOW THEY HAVE DANGLING PHOTO CHARMS, AND AGAIN, YOU CAN USE A STOCK ONE OR ONE OF YOUR OWN PHOTOS:July Birthstone Bead Photo Charm Ruby Red Crystal Silver Plated fits European BraceletYou can even get a medical alert charm for your bracelet from them!!!!!!!!!!!!Pugster Pandora Style Bead Sign Medical Alert Photo Love European Charm Beads Fits Pandora BraceletPugster carries Glass Foil beads in many colors and sizes and I have never seen such beads carried by anyone else. These are pretty...but beware, they come in various sizes per color, so keep an eye on what you are getting...check that shipping price. Pugster Murano Glass Bead Foil Turquoise Line Slim Fit Pandora Bead Charms BraceletWell, you would think I was doing a Pugster commercial. But, like many of you who have written about this particular charm, I got burned on some of the things I bought from them. They are an unusual company and fill a niche that no one else seems to fill. They have the usual run of the mill charms, but not in sterling so they are a bit cheaper. They have the unusual picture charms, and the foil beads with lines on them. Some of their things are great; some are not. The most accurate indicator of what you are getting is their shipping price.I hope this long blurb helps you identify the Pugster items you want, and those you want to pass by!"

I tend to put A LOT of stuff in my bags yet somehow this bag accommodates all I need and want to carry without ever looking stuffed or over-filled, has so many pockets and sections I can put even more stuff in, yet, because of its relatively shorter height, I can see everything at once and find what I need quickly.

For those put off by the price, rest assured that you will fully get your money's worth and will probably be as happy as I am with this bag.

I am currently 25 and began getting back pain from poor bra support years ago, along with the cutting indentions from my straps.  Most women in their early 20s seem to have the opinion that bras, such as Playtex, are for the older generations.  They're wrong.  I have never found a bra so incredibly perfect and am not embarrassed at all when I brag to my friends about my new found love. I've actually discovered since I've spread the word, that many of my younger friends are very interested to see what Playtex has to offer - especially since we are all in a physically demanding career.  My ONLY negative feelings towards this particular style of bra and the ""Active"" style, is they have zero nipple coverage.  If you are a little chilly, it tends to be no secret for those around you. I also wish they would had more variety of colors. Black, nude and white do become boring after a while. This is not going to keep me from purchasing Playtex though.

Oh. My. Goodness. These are amazing, I mean AH-MAY-ZING boots.If you have a calf size of 15&#34; or under, then these should fit (I take an 11 and these are what mine measure).However, I have a muscular (I call it muscular, but, in truth, it's just fat) calf. 18&#34;I decided to order these boot because I just absolutely fell in love with them from the photos. Quite the investment, but Amazon is so good with returns, I thought it worth the risk.When they arrived, I just knew I had to figure out a way to get the calf stretch so I could wear them (without stretching, I could not even get these on).I called my local shoe repair and lucked in to one who had those old-style metal calf stretcher. EUREKA!After 5 days on the stretcher, I'm pleased to say they were able to stretch them to 17&#34;.I still can't pull them up completely, but I can get them on with a boot horn and they look awesome a little slouched.I'm hoping that, with time, they will stretch some more. (I do have them on over leggings and tall socks and am wearing them in the house right now to help keep the stretch going - I just got them back today, so I am loving them up while they're still new - LOL).Bottom Line: Amazing quality boot made in Mexico; True to size, maybe a smidge big...in my case, with taking an 11, I do think a 10.5 would be too snug. I also think I'd be able to wear a sport sock in these; The look is beyond believable.; The vintage feel/look is awesome; The calf is maximum 15&#34; around.I wish Frye would make more extended calf boots. If I didn't already own the Veronica Shorties, I'd invest in the extended calf Veronica talls, but, I do think there are at least 3 or 4 others I'd be tempted in if they had extended calf.4 out of 5 simply for the calf size. Otherwise, this is a 5 start boot. Heck, it's a 100 start boot."

I also added a set of heel grippers hoping to take up some of the extra space in the back but the heel area is pretty much straight up and down and doesn't cup in at the ankle to hold your heel from slipping up and down.

I've always stuck with Nikes because the tall heel on Danskos scared me and I saw myself twisting my ankle.

I tried some on in a local specialty store and was fitted, but didn't buy there for $109-$149...I know I'm a jerk! This shoes are def different because they are not designed to grip ontio your entire foot. Your foot is meant to slide around a bit. The back of the shoe is for safety and to keep in on, but it does not touch the back of your heel the entire time you're wearing it and this takes some getting used to. This show is a tad narrow for my feet that are a little on the wide side, but I think I just need to break them in. I do like the posture the shoe forces you to have and the cushion and support I feel. I've had many patients say they had severe back pain and these shoes instantly improved their pain.

I was concerned about the sizing after reading some of the other reviews as well, but these fit great.  I am a 9.5 and the 9.5 fit me well.  I love the adjustability of all straps.  The bed of the shoe as well as the inside of the straps are soft so along with the adjustments they make the shoes fit like a glove.  I did notice that they were a bit heavier on my feet than my other Clarks, due to the wood heel I assume, but not so much to cause discomfort.  They are very well made, cute, and casually dressy. I purchased them to specifically to wear with sundresses.  I am a tough one to please generally when it comes to shoes, but Clarks seem to have my name all over them, and this one is now added to my wardrobe."

Medium, B US in this boot fit perfectly.I like the length of the laces; just long enough to easily tie a double knot without having a lot of extra lace dangling.  Also, these have the type of laces that don't loosen up and come undone while you're walking.A horse hasn't stepped on the toe yet, so I can't attest to how well this safety toe will hold up to that.  I also haven't stepped in a deep puddle to fully test the waterproofing; however having walked through mud, horse manure and tall, wet grass & weeds, the waterproof liner wasn't breached.

The support is great because it smooths you out from under your arm down and firmly supports your back, waist and stomach.  Having the option of wearing your own bra is so great and makes wearing a girdle like this more comfortable.  The two things that I don't like about this girdle are the straps and the crotch.  The straps are narrow and after while dig into your shoulders and really hurt.  The straps should be a little wider since the girdle supports your whole torso.  The other thing is the crotch is great because it unfastens for convenience but it hooks right under your butt and makes going to the bathroom a pain.

I think this is the perfect tool for teaching teens how to start getting to places on time. Believe it or not, I don't regret this purchase. Not only is this watch cute (he gets tons of complements from his friends about it), but it wasn't expensive (under $30). And this watch doesn't look cheap or flashy. The gold tone isn't too harsh or too gold. It is just right. And my son loves the fact that the band is elastic and he says that it is very comfortable. I also like the fact that the face of the watch not only shows the time but the date alarm as well. There is even an alarm feature.

"06 30, 2013",I671727303,5.0,This reviewer opines that this is one of the finest Claddagh designs available,"[['Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Heart-Shaped Jewelry'], ['Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Women', 'Jewelry', 'Fine', 'Rings', 'Bands'], ['Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Novelty, Costumes & More', 'Novelty']]","CLADDAGH RING, CELTIC KNOTTED, WITHOUT HANDS, a/k/a LWRS043 Nickel Free .925 Sterling Silver Irish Claddagh Friendship and Love Band Polished Finish Ring (by Gem Avenue) is a beautiful, fine investment for the discriminating Claddagh-lover. (See here: Elya Designs Stainless Steel Claddagh Ring with Celtic Knot Eternity Design (5mm) - Sizes 5 -12 for another beautiful ring which I own and reviewed. It's lovely too.)This excellent piece of sterling consists of a 2mm band leading up to a bezel design of 1cm (10mm) total length - thus it is a dainty, slender ring best designed for starting/finishing off a nicely stacked ring finger. Let me forewarn buyers who might have bought without studying this ring: its design does NOT include the traditional hands clasping the heart.That was one reason I liked it, as I wear it stacked with another heavy ring. It is also extremely thin, so be aware that the image is shown to you not so as to deceive, but as to show you detail. I knew this when I purchased mine and am thrilled, thrilled, thrilled. Now I can boast as fine a Claddagh as the ones my wife inherited from her grandmother.Now as to the lore: as a ring expert (ring study is one of my hobbies contained within my anthropology profession) I can tell you these rings originated in Rome. There they were intricately designed clasped hands and were known as the ""hands-in-faith"" ring. We do not know when this design was taken to Ireland, but the village of Claddagh seems to be the first place they began to make them in the 17th century.As to how to wear the ring, I don't think it matters much these days - but there are traditions. Really you have only the choice of finger on which to wear and then which direction to orient the heart. To me, it doesn't mean much. The venerable history of the ring and its inherent beauty is more than enough (even Queen Victoria favored one and wore it always, as did some of her sons).The Claddagh ring of the village of Claddagh, County Galway, is no longer just for women. Then again, I don't believe it was exclusively for women at any given time in history. The story goes that the young ladies of Claddagh inherited a ring and wore it on the right hand. Once they got a follower, they switched the ring to the left hand to show they were spoken for - and once married, I believe they turned the ring upside-down on the wedding finger so as to accommodate the stacking of their wedding band, which the groom had to bestow.Anything else you hear about this grand ring is probably poppycock. Men began wearing them probably in the mid-19th century, possibly earlier. Several of Queen Victoria's sons wore them, and I have read evidence suggesting men commonly wore them in the 17th and 18th centuries.So do not let chauvinism stop you, gentlemen! This ring is eminently wearable and fashionable. What are you waiting for, I say this lovely iteration of the Claddagh is the one to get, especially if you plan to stack them or if you have dainty hands and want something thin and fine.Or to paraphrase Oscar Wilde, the question is not whether you can live without one, but whether you can live up to it!"

The Blue/White is pretty loud, but with a up to date feel.The 1080 v4 is an amazingly comfortable shoe for running or just walking around.  It has a lot of padding and feels very cushiony.  The toe box is on the roomy side but only slightly.  It feels like it has a little extra width and height, which I find almost necessary for a running shoe.  Best of all, the shoe breathes really well and doesn't weigh your foot down much, especially considering the cushioning."

"07 2, 2013",I770698565,5.0,Just when you thought QUALITY was a thing of the past...,"[['Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Men', 'Clothing', 'Shirts', 'T-Shirts']]","What would inspire a guy who bought 6 white undershirts at a warehouse club to go onto Amazon and write a review?  If you had told me I would do this after buying the shirts, I would have called you crazy.  But here I am, and this is going to be one of the most glowing reviews I have ever written.First of all, for those of you who have not been bitten by the Costco bug, you have not yet lived.  Sure, Amazon is the ultimate online experience, and that'll always be my first stop for just about anything.  But if you are looking for a treasure hunt in a good ol' brick and mortar store, you cannot beat Costco.  It puts Sam's Club to shame for fun factor and quality of merchandise, including both brand names and the house brand--Kirkland Signature.  Never hesitate for a moment when given the choice of a Kirkland Signature over a national brand.  This is Costco.  You are not shopping the grocery store, Target, or some other retailer where private label means second rate.  Rather, it means BUY ME, I AM BETTER THAN THE NATIONAL BRAND--A TRUE VALUE THAT CANNOT BE BEATEN.And so begins the story of my first experience with these exquisite undershirts.  Having long been a fan of Kirkland Signature products, I knew they would be good, but NEVER did I think I would be so inspired by an undershirt.  By this time, you are thinking I am a few cards short of a full deck.  Sure, think what you want.  You haven't experienced these T-shirts.  So, maybe I should tell you what makes them so great:+ Thick & Luxurious: The difference here is like the difference between a cheap bath towel and one of those really thick, soft, heavy bath towels that you usually only find in expensive hotels.  Really, these undershirts are unmistakably superior, and you'll know it from the moment you touch the cotton.  Some of you pansies are thinking, ""Oh, I would sweat in those."" They are cotton, I say.  They breathe.  Not to worry.+ Tight Weave: Those ordinary undershirts (Hanes, Fruit of the Loom, whatever) are all the same.  They are cheap, lightweight fabric that stretches terribly.  Just try to stretch one of these undershirts.  You'll instantly know that these shirts are cut from a different cloth, literally.+ Fitted Shape: If you have a pot belly or wear a man bra, don't buy these undershirts, as they are made for the rest of us--those whose proportions more closely resemble a human being than a bowling pin.  I appreciate a shirt that isn't made to fit either me or Fred Flintstone.+ Long Length: Cheapo undershirts sell ""Tall"" versions of their shirts for guys that don't want their shirts coming untucked.  Kirkland Signature gives everybody a longer shirt, because WHO THE HECK WANTS HIS SHIRT COMING UNTUCKED?!?  This is a benefit we should all enjoy, and you will if you buy this shirt.+ Value: My price in store was lower than what I see online, but I would pay this price without batting an eye, if I could not find these in my local Costco.  They are one of those products that is just SO MUCH BETTER than anything else that they are worth a few extra bucks.+ Preshrunk: Mine fit perfectly right out of the package.  Since then, they have been washed and dried several times, and they still fit perfectly.+ Tagless: OK, so the cheap undershirts do this now, too, but it is still worth mentioning that Kirkland Signature has it right with no scratchy tags.I am so impressed with these shirts that my wheels have been turning ever since I put on the first one.  What else could I do with them?  Could I dye them and wear them as regular casual shirts?  Could I embroider them for a customized style?  Could I screen print them?  Could I start my own t-shirt company and use these shirts as the raw material for so many great creative expressions?  The answer to these questions is all YES!Hats off to Kirkland Signature for making such an inspirational undershirt.  Yes, inspirational undershirt.  It's that good."

Unable to find the ones I wanted in my size, I finally went with these based on several reviews hailing them as great Zumba shoes.  After trying them on, I think people may be getting sold more on the look than the function. I work out at home, so cute is optional but function is a must. The split sole on these is thick, smooth plastic with a few grooves but absolutely no grain; they give you plenty of slide--but no stability.  First I tossed the rug aside and tried them on the hardwood, which for me is a better surface for dance and Zumba than carpet.  Slides and turns were smooth and effortless--stopping, not so much.  On lunges your feet just keep sliding, and you have to fight for balance to prevent doing the involuntary splits.  The extra strain and lack of control are the things injuries are made of--especially of the knees and back. Next I put the big asian area rug back down over the hardwood and tried that; these shoes still slide a little too much when moving front and back--slides to the side are a little better on the rug, just because the texture of the carpet offers some sideways resistance.  For me, the plastic soles on these just don't provide enough traction to safely do fast-moving workouts like Zumba.  They're probably fine for professional dancers doing spins and toe stands, preferably with a partner for support.  I gave 3 stars for the look and the overall quality of the shoes--they're cute enough and seem well-made. But cute does not equal practical, especially for the price, so I returned them. So far the best shoes I've found for Zumba are still the Sansha Salsette; they have a medium-grain suede sole pad that offers a good balance between slide and friction.  (And they're less expensive.) So far, they've also been impossible to find in the right size.Speaking of size, if you think these are for you, listen to the reviews that say to order a half size up--not a whole size.  I wear an 8.5 and ordered the 9.5 to make sure I still had toe room, since these shoes are cut flat across the front for toe work.  With socks they were still a bit too big--loose enough to add to the clumsiness caused by the slick sole.  A half size up from street size would have fit just about right."

That is what I ordered.  First of all do I agree that the shoes look not too bad, although the front is quite wide looking but maybe thats because its a wide size.  There are a few problems I noticed so far,  1. The front edge of the upper rubs against the bed of my toenail making a sore spot. This is because the front part of the arch strap is quite tight and holds my foot back too far. The shoe itself is not too small, as I can see there is still lots of toe-room left on the front of the shoe.  2. the lining of the upper is man-made smooth material, which makes my feet slide back easily.  . Due to (1) and (2)  my feet are still too far back and walking in them feels awkward .  3. The footbed is harder than i had hoped and it is  not very molded, it is more flat, and it is also not supportive in the arch.  The sole is stiff and hard enough to make me sound like a horse clip clopping around.  I really hope these sandals soften up and feel better after a few more days of breaking in."

He found out you have to hold a tiny flat-headed screw driver in one end of the pin while turning the other end with another tiny flat-headed screwdriver to release it. You could have another person hold one end while you work on the other or use a vise, clamp, or in our case, a drawer (held tight with your knee).

My first FitFlops were the bronze Walkstar III sandals, and they were/are the most fabulous, amazing thong sandals I've ever owned.  I absolutely love them.  Once they've formed to my feet (after less than a day of wear) they were/are a dream to wear.  But, then I wanted more colors, so I ordered the silver Walkstar III and a black Oasis FitFlops.  The Black Oasis sandals seem to even fit and wear better than the bronze Walkstar III, but the silver Walkstar III sandals hurt from the get-go and continue to hurt my feet, even after wearing many, many times over last sandal season and into this season--don't know why but somehow they are different, the toe-thong cuts where the others don't and the heel cushion doesn't seem to absorb the shock on heel to toe impact like the other two pairs do.  I now only wear the silver ones when I'm going to be out for a short period of time and never for long walks.  So, whether these shoes work for you could depend on which color you order, or perhaps FitFlops manufacturing process is not of a consistent quality assurance as it definitely should be for the price of the shoes and the proclamations they make.  Although from previous reviews they do have more satisfied customers than non, and perhaps that is the company's acceptable margin of error.  I would still most definitely recommend these shoes, just perhaps if you happen to get a sore pair, don't give up and try another, but that is difficult to expect since one has to wear them for awhile to know whether they will work or not, and current return policies don't allow the return of worn shoes.  Perhaps that is some kind of guarantee/warranty that FitFlops needs to consider if they aren't going to consistently make the same shoe during manufacturing.As far as fitness--if you've got a properly made pair--for the first time relative sedentary user, one may feel some (very mild) workout burn in their calves and inner knee area to the lower inner thigh  (I did), but that soon goes away after continual wear.  They do seem to help with posture related back problems somewhat.  But these are basically just shoes, so don't expect miracles if you have really bad posture to begin with or any considerable amount of fat to burn off in the legs, thighs, and hips, but whatever walking exercise you take on during the sandal seasons these will help absorb a great deal of shock in your workout and offer a better reach and control than you can get from any other sandal or flip flop."

I ordered both the 46 and the 48 DD/F/G in this bra because of the combined cup size. The 46 was small in the cup for me. I had some spillage both on the sides and in the front of the bra. The straps felt short as well, due to my breasts overwhelming the cups and requiring the extra stretch of the material. The band itself fit fine.The 10 front hooks are more than I would like, though I still find them easier to manage than a back hooking bra with my tennis elbow. The material is smooth and silky and feels good against my skin, and the bra appears to be well-made and of high-quality.As a sleep or lounge around the house bra (which is what I'm looking for), this works well. The lack of underwire, molding, padding, and compression make it comfortable. The stretchy material is supportive enough to run down to the garage, do laundry, and visit a neighbor (I live in an apartment building), but nowhere near enough to wear outside the confines of the building. My breasts are simply too heavy and require the support of some of the features I mentioned above. The bra itself is comfortable enough to wear anywhere, but I would feel far too self-conscious and saggy.If you normally wear a DD or F cup, you may be fine with your regular band size or want to go up one size. If you have full breasts and are a definite G cup, I recommend ordering 1-2 sizes up. The 48 DD/F/G fits me far better than the 46 because of the extra cup allowance.I don't recommend this bra for every day wear unless you have very firm breasts and don't require (or feel you need) much support. However, as a leisure/sleep bra, it serves its purpose well."

Zipper means you don't have to unlace your boot, and I am lazy so this was a must have for me.  It is a tight fit for my thick feet to do without unlacing, but doable so that is all that matters too me.  I haven't tested water resistance.Boot is comfortable and not overly hot after broken in, but definitely hotter than a standard tennis shoe.  Laces are too short, I could barely get them double knotted.  Build quality is good, but slightly messy looking, some strings hanging out slightly at the ends of the stitches, etc.  So I think they could definitely have better build quality, but zipper strength seems fine and stitching is good overall.Great traction on many surfaces, including slick tile, and sizing seems right on.  I wear a 10.5 extra wide, and the size fit perfectly.  The toe is a bit longer than it needs to be, but the arch is right where it should be and so is the width.  I will buy these again.  My older pair without the zipper lasted many years, but the finish didn't hold up well.  You can polish these if you want so it doesn't really matter."

I've seen rave reviews across the web claiming that this bra is the answer.  I'd say it was almost right.  Firstly, I ordered my true size which is a 34G and there was definite spillage (through herroom.com's massive selection and fantastic return policy I now finally know the right size for me, but this bra was cheaper here on Amazon.com).  They didn't offer a higher cup size so I went up another band size to the 36G.  I don't quite have the same separation as the model shown (so a swipe of deodorant though the cleavage is helpful) but I definitely did NOT have uni-boob!  I was so excited to show my sister who&#8217;s in a similar situation (thanks genes) and she couldn&#8217;t believe I was even wearing a sports bra.  Secondly, I love the material as it's soft and smooth.  Thirdly, there is no underwire in this model which seemed really counter-intuitive to me because in regular bras I need the wire.  I found the Shock Absorber to have enough separation and lift despite not having the wire.  Getting it on was a little challenging, but nothing a few practice tries won&#8217;t resolve.  I've recently started rock climbing and it definitely helped keep the girls out of my way while I was going up the wall.  I've also been able to do jumping jacks for the first time without injury.  I used to subscribe to the class of large-chested women who wore a regular bra with 2 sports bras over it and that did not give me the same level of control as this bra did and this bra allowed me to breathe a little easier than that subpar solution.  So in sum, it does run small, but it's worth going up in band or cup sizes to get the right fit.  Also, at the time I ordered this one, I ordered the Glamorise Women's Adjustable Bounce Control Sports Bra which I think has more control, less comfort, but is cheaper.  See my review there if interested.  Finally, unfortunately because of the design of the &#34;harness&#34; as I like to refer to this one, it does create a noticeable amount of back bulge in the opening between the top and bottom clasps.  Not noticeable with a t-shirt on but if you intended to wear it alone this is your heads up about that situation."

It has 5 daily alarms, hourly chime, barometric pressure /altitude reading and trend chart, air temperature (reads warm when wearing the watch, but perfect reading when attached to my backpack), altitude alarm, and compass (which is functional but  not a serious tool).  Great watch for the price. Very happy with it."

The faux leather is really nice , no one could ever tell the difference unless they went down to your foot level and examined the boot. The boot is very easy to walk in , comfortable for the heel height. I am used to high heeled shoes & boots so these were great. I did tighten the top buckle to make the boot less wide on the top and it looks fine. Overall they seem to be a good quality boot and look great on. They can be worn with many different outfits, dresses, skirts, crops. jeans. etc. very versatile and trendy looking boot. I love boots and own many pairs.I'd say these are one of the best deals I ever purchased for such awesome boots. I really do love them, very comfortable and classy looking. Get in the trend and order these boots you will not be sorry.UPDATE: I wore the boots out today & they were not snug at all , they were actually a little big. When I had first tried them on I was bare foot, when I put my tights on they fit looser than I had thought. They are not too big, but not snug as I previously stated.

I hated them.  But I've started to have a lot of foot pain--foot cramps, pain in my heel that may or may not be plantar fascitiitis.  I've tried a lot of options.  Barefoot style running shoes from Merrell, birkenstocks (I used to love these, but now birks exacerbate the problems), just plain old Nike slides (comfortable, but caused foot cramps).I asked around and people recommended crocs, but they are so ugly!  I couldn't deal!  Then I found these.  I went to try them on in the store first, because I got the sense from reading reviews that sizing was all over the place (true!).  I usually wear a 9, but when I tried these on in 9, they only just fit.....my toes and heel were right at the edge.  The straps fit well, but I didn't like how close I was to the edge of the shoe.So I came home, ordered the 10 on Amazon, and pretty much haven't worn anything else since I got them.  It's true, the straps are slightly looser in the 10 than I like (haven't tried the dryer trick yet), but I'm used to that in other shoes, so I can live with it.  But I wore these all day.  I walked several miles in them.  And no pain at all!  I'm thrilled!Not all the crocs feel so good on--and certainly not all of them fit the same.  I've had to send some other pairs back.  I like that  these have just a whisper of a heel, too, because that makes the heel feel more cushy to me, which is lovely.So if you're looking for comfortable shoes, these are it!  And not too bad looking either!eta:  I wanted to add that I took these with me on a recent trip to Germany.  It was hot, hot, hot, and we did a lot of walking.  I wore these everyday, and my feet never hurt.  One day, we waded in a rocky stream, and I just walked right in with them on--can't do that with most shoes!  Love these!"

I ordered both A/B and C/D just because I ordered some tights before (XS but not from this brand) and it was a little too tight on my feet because of my height. I tried the A/B which is just as expected - about mid thigh length and it fits quite well but... you have to take into consideration the top silicone band which takes about 2inches of the length. So if you plan on wearing something mid thigh then this one is going to be a little too short because you don't want the anti slip silicone top show out, right?! I tried the C/D as well and it fits good as well. I can easily pull it up to the top of my thigh (but I can also make it less tight by leaving it at mid-thigh length). Obviously on me, size C/D is more black than A/B and the silicone band is a bit bigger but you can still kind of see through the knee when flexing your cuff (there's no noticeable difference on bending knee part when choosing AB or CD), as to the silicone top I am not quite sure as I have not wore C/D for entire day to test it but when I tried it walking in the house it stayed (I'm usually 0 or XS, or 24/25 and I have slim legs).

I ordered a size 9medium.  I normally wear a size 9.5 in nike running shoes, but reading all the reviews I decided to order a bit small.  They fit perfect without socks and also with very very thin no show socks.  I probably could have even ordered an 8.5 in womens because the toe box is so large and roomy.  The tongue of the shoe is sewn to the shoe which is a nice feature.  The laces are a little bit long once they are tied tight, but that is an easy fix.  Have not done any running in them yet, but have put in a few hours of walking in them without socks and they are comfortable (no blisters or sore feet yet).  Would not recommend these to people who are on their feet all day, lacking support (which is the point).

I applied each cup as the directions suggest, turning the cups inside out then applying from outside in, I had to reapply one twice because it is a little tricky making sure the two cups line up with one another.  The manufacturer suggests that you not wear the bra for more than 6hrs at a time, probably to minimize any sort of reaction or possibly the bra becoming less adhesive the longer you wear it, but I tested it for 12 hrs just to see what would happen.  The bra was just as adhesive when I took them off as when I first out them on.  I washed the cups by lightly applying mild soap and wiping the soap off with water on my hand with the cups folded inside out.  I let them air dry over night in the open and the adhesive is deffinitely refreshed.  While the bra was completely comfortable and served my needs if I was hoping for some lift then I probably would have been disappointed.  It gave me cleavage, but it was like cleavage that you can achieve with a really tight sports bra, smashed down cleavage.

I am 117 lbs. 5'6&#34; my waist is only 26&#34; around, if YOU are bigger than this the &#34;LARGE&#34; WON&#34;T FIT YOU (TOO TIGHT), the fit and the elastic around the waist is just perfect for me in &#34;large&#34;, length is as you see it below the knee. &#34;First&#34; I ordered size medium thinking it will stretch, and even though it is 70% cotton and only 30% wool I stuck my arms inside the skirt while I was wearing it and cranked as hard as I could to stretch it out, NO LUCK! For waist band, it was &#34;way&#34; too tight right out of the package, so lets see that would make their size medium a size &#34;0&#34; since I am a size 2 US!!! Now your gettin the picture! After sending back the size medium, of coarse I ordered size &#34;Large&#34; knowing for &#34;me&#34; this would work, and it did. Large for me was very comfortable while it still had some snug fit in a perfect sexy but classy way. It just does not look good girls unless you want to look like a hooker to wear clothes &#34;too&#34; tight.

And that's what I did. I was amazed when I held it up to look at it that it was just the same size and color as it was before I washed it. Of coarse I was not going to place it in the dryer, that would be dumb, instead I just layed it out on my fold out drying rack and wala it's just the same as before I washed it except now it's a little softer (from using a &#34;small&#34; amount of fabric softner)! Just so you know I opened the washer while it was washing and there was &#34;no&#34; dye bleeding into the water. So this is a very well made skirt and top notch material, BUT, BEWARE OF THE SIZING!

Step in a shallow pool and your foot will instantly be wet.  There was also a slight friction point on one of my toes right below where the laces end.  This seems to have gone away after a little use.They definitely improved my running vs my old shoes.  I don't run a lot, maybe 3 times a week for about 2 miles each, but I am heavy and need supportive shoes, and these do the trick.

The leather was definitely soft and buttery, so I was expecting that from Ralph Lauren, and the shaft wasn't too tall. This is hard for me to find because I'm only 5'1"" and these boots hit me about an inch below the knee. However, the circumference at the top was soo narrow and I'm pretty petite. Also, even with the pull straps on the inside of the boot, it was really hard to get my foot into the actual shoe AND there was material that would bunch right at the heel afterwards so you really have to tug to straighten it out. The shaft is not tapered properly from the ankle to the top, so I ended up having a lot of bunching at the ankle. Finally, since I bought this in black and there was the bunching at the ankle, this ended up looking like a glorified rain boot.

WOW!!! It took me 2 tries though, let me explain. These boots are definitely not all made the same, at least not the Oiled Suede ones. The first pair I got did not resemble the color pictured at all. It was a dark brown with no color variations, not attractive at all. The reason I ordered this pair was because of the color. They slipped right on but the right foot was definitely tighter than the left (same problem as another reviewer) and didn't feel good at all especially on the heal, way too tight.I decided to order another pair just to see if the color and fit would be any better. I'm glad I did. The color on the second pair is BEAUTIFUL!!! It's that warm, old-looking, worn in brown, with nice color variations, very much like the picture. They really look like an old favorite pair of boots, I envision Ralph Lauren (or his wife Ricky) walking around in these at his ranch in Colorado. I went to put my foot in and boy was it hard, a bit of a shock since I slipped right into the first pair. I put on a thin dress sock and with a bit of persistence (just a bit) I got them on. It's strange because getting them on was a lot harder than the other pair but they feel and fit great once on (unlike the other pair). Long story longer, I love these boots and hope they will hold up for years as many people stated they will. The price was unbeatable."

Part of this info comes from wikipedia site and I believe that I read about the bird deaths from cotton pesticides in the book, Eco-Mind, by Francis Lappe Moore, been a while since I read it, so don't quote me on that. Got it from the library, so don't have the book in front of me for referral.Anyway, as far as these pajamas go, I could not be more pleased. They are beautiful and also very functional, with exceptional comfort. Very soft on the skin and the most comfortable pajamas that I have slept in. I used to not spend quite this much on pajamas, usually got flannel for winter use (I'm not wealthy), but after reading about so much environmental damage from non-organic cotton, I decided that it was worthwhile to spend a little more and feel a little better about myself for doing something positive to help the environment. I will try to make them last a long time, do hope the fabric holds up well with washing, have only had them a few days. Maybe in about six months I will edit this and let people know how the fabric is holding up with numerous washings."

What's better yet is that I won this from a local snake handler out her in Nebraska. I went into town last evening because I needed some milk and stopped by the local convenience store and there were two old men watching the election results on an abc network. I saw that one of the old men had this nice watch which he wore as he was holding a whole mess of snakes. Me, I tend not to ask too many questions of the townies because I know im an outsider so I walked past grabed some milk and went to pay. When I was up at the counter I said ""wow can't believe obama won again"" (the radio had just reported this before I came in). The snake handler stuck the snakes in my face and said ""what you mean boy! He still needs 18 votes!"" Sure enough abc had not reported that obama had won yet so I quickly took this to my advantage. I bet the snake handler my gremlin against his watch which he jumped all over. As soon as we shook hands the ""breaking news"" came over the tv and obama was declared the victor. I told the snake handler that I was clairvoyant and that it was a premonition that I knew, but I also said a deals a deal so fork over the watch; which he did. Quietly I took my new watch and my milk and strolled back out to the gremlin. What a rube!"

I was testing this non stop for a while, flipping the glasses up and down just to see the difference.The blue/purple shadows on the snow is turned to a slight green or cyan green.  It sort of gives you the impression of being on Mars (as far as your imagination can take you).  This blocks out an impressive amount of glare and I would say to the extent you feel no need to squint at all during any moment with these on.If you are fortunate enough to live in a state with snowfall and happen to have these during that time, you can really test out its effectiveness.  Look at some bright white snow during high noon and you basically see white, put these on and you can actually see the texture of the snow.The blue blocking qualities aside we move on to the actual durability of the product.  The frame I would imagine is not the strongest, but so far I don't have much issue with this.  I keep this strictly as driving glasses and they remain in my vehicle.  The lenses don't appear to have any kind of scratch resistant treatment and so do seem to be readily prone to them.  An email to Triple Optics with my concerns and it's taken care of.  Great customer service.Triple Optic's customer service is top notch and so far they stand by the claim you see.Not everyone appreciates the Retro design and I didn't think much of it, but these seem to work for people with giant heads like mine and their design doesn't give me a headache.The glasses are affordable and backed by awesome customer service.

"10 28, 2012",I751533558,3.0,Not my favorite of the Anita nursing bras,"[['Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Women', 'Maternity', 'Intimates', 'Nursing & Maternity Bras'], ['Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Women', 'Petite']]","I wear a 38 G (was 36 DDD pre pregnancy), and have bought a variety of nursing bras.  Compared to the other Anita bras I have (the microfiber and the jaquard one), this is my least favorite.  It is very big and clunky.  I know I have a pretty huge cup size, but not every bra screams that.  The stretch microfiber anita nursing bra is just so much more comfortable and pretty.  This is not the bra I want my friends to see me wearing when we're having a baby play date and nursing together.  I know that sounds so superficial, but you want to feel pretty in a bra.  And not like a big ol' mamma ... even if you are a big ol' mama.Other than that, it's functional.  It's just big and clunky without being particularly more supportive."

Being a darker color it doesn't shine as much.

"01 12, 2010",I890656857,5.0,GREAT BOOTS!  GREAT PRICE!!,"[['Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Shoes & Accessories: International Shipping Available'], ['Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'E', 'EMU Australia'], ['Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Boot Shop'], ['Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Women', 'Shoes', 'Boots']]","I had done a lot of research shopping both online and in local stores before purchasing these boots.  I found a couple websites that claimed to sell REAL Uggs that when doing further research, I found out they were scams.  I tried on these same EMU boots at a local Macy's store and was pleasantly surprised with the quality and comfort of these boots, but was hesitant to pay $159 for them.  Boy, am I glad I waited!  I came home and looked up the same boots on Amazon.com and they were $90 less.  At $69.98, these boots were a steal.  And they are real EMU's!  I love how they feel, and even after being on my feet for hours, my feet don't sweat and the lining doesn't get moist like with the imitation brands.  I would highly suggest to anyone that you buy these boots.  At a fraction of the price of UGG's, but with the same Australian Sheepskin, it would be a crime to pay more!  As always, Amazon.com came through with a great product at a GREAT price!"
