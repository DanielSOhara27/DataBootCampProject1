"12 9, 2010",B000JQUU00,5.0,A Great Collection of Fairy Tales,A36K2N527TXXJN,"Fairy tales are usually thought of as children's literature, and in terms of how much children in particular are fascinated with them this categorization is not without a merit. However, most good fairy tales tap into some social or personal tension, a fact of life, or a natural phenomenon. They often take rather ordinary situations and push them to the limit of what our imagination considers plausible. Fairy tales are thus a form of reductio ad absurdum of common sense, and they often help us see various life situations in terms of their most basic principles. This is why fairy tales have had, and continue to have, a lot of fascination with adults as well.Most of us have grown up with fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen or Brothers Grimm. There is a sort of cannon of western fairy tales that have become part of the common patrimony of the entire world - Little Red Riding Hood, Snow White, Rapunzel, and many others. However, these fairy tales are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the European fairy tales, and there are many other folk tales that are not as familiar as these and yet are equally beautiful and imaginative.This collection of the English fairy tales is as great of a collection of fairy tales as they come. It is rather fascinating to see that even thought many fairy tales reflect certain English cultural norms, the basic structure and the motifs are surprisingly familiar. We have villains and heroes charged with an unusual and demanding task, monsters and unusual magical objects are everywhere, there are damsels-in-distress aplenty, and most tales take place ""once upon a time."" All of the tales are very well written and the language is crisp and contemporary. The dialogues, however, are replete with colloquial English expressions and turns of phrase, and these characteristics give the fairy tales a very folksy feel. This collection will be a great source of enjoyment for children and adults alike."
"05 22, 2014",B000MAH6G4,4.0,Unusual Hawke,A33RHQR728SFY6,"Vaughan had created an appealing character for his series of westerns. The hero is physically true to the Western genre, yet is a very talented and respected classical pianist. He can draw fast and shoot straight. The stories are entertaining and make for a nice addition to your library if you enjoy reading Westerns with a twist."
"04 24, 2011",B000PDZG6K,4.0,Romance wonderfulness!,A2QSWFY1266IAK,"4.5/5.0Oh, I HATE it when you have to round it up or down and neither way fits!!The romance, angst and relationships in this story are INCREDIBLE!! Heart-wrenching, tear-jerking, sigh-worthy  wonderfulness.  The suspense was just a little tiny, itty-bit flat."
"06 19, 2013",B000R93D4Y,4.0,Dragons!,A25765HWTT6Z32,Who would think that dragons would  bond so closely with their knights that they merged mind and body.... you really will enjoy this wonderful episode.....
"06 21, 2011",B001IWL1ZM,3.0,A good read for a free novella,A15EL7I42ETNQX,"This is a short story.  I started reading about 9 and was done well before 12.  Tht being said, it didn't seem ridiculousy rushed as some short books do.  There was lots of male-dominated animalistic sex, some development of feelings, and even a little danger and death mixed into the &#34;plot.&#34;  It is a short story, so the plot is minimal and there is little character development.  Honestly, everything outside of the main characters getting it on seems more like an afterthought.  The one thing that really bothered me is the ending, though.  After the guy & girl get together, they go back and eveal that the bad guys' plot has been uncovered and thwarted, but it doesn't say how.  It seems to me it would have been cleaner to leave the resolution at the disposal of the green guy, or if it's a plot-continuation part for the next book, at the corporate guys in the ship.  The news report just seems hasty to me.Spoiler Alert:  A Tyger navigator is the only one who can safely program the Nav computer to get the ship through a dangerous asteroid belt, but because of unforseen delays our hero is cought onboard during his mating shift without a woman.  A female Tyger with a secret crush on the hero offers herself as his sex-slave, basically, while he is in shift so that he doesn't go crazy and so he can nav the ship.  Predictably, she falls for him even though she knows she shouldn't.  He falls for  but doesn't really get it.  Meanwhile, there's a terrorist plot to blow up the nav computer onboard and thus crash the ship into the asteroids.  The terrorist plants his bio bomb, which kills the nav computer.  He then tries to escape thru the arboretum where the lovers were holed up.  He sees the chick naked and tries to run past while Tyger tracks him down.  Tyer catches him and rips his throat out after questioning him briefly.  Tyger decides to manually steer the ship to the planet- a feat which hasn't been done in the last 100 years or more, and becomes a hero when he's successful.  Unfortunately, he offers to set the girl up as his mistress.  She takes off and he sulks for weeks.  Then his parents make him realize he should marry her even though she isn't from the upper class.  He runs off to get her to find she is on a ship and has just gone into heat.  He goes to her, and you can guess the rest- he asks her to promise to obey, and she asks him to cherish her.  Oh, then there was some little scene where we see the brains behind the terrorists being upset that it didn't work, and we learn that it's not about Ecoterrorism at all (which was hinted earlier), but rather about eliminating the competition of another shipping co.  In the very end, there is a news announcement that the plot was uncovered, but no details as to how or by whom.Overall, a decent read for a fee novella, but I might have been less kind had I paid for this book.  The submissive stuff was not over the top, fortunately, but isn't my thing so it detracted from my enjoyment some."
"06 12, 2011",B001V9KG4E,1.0,Don't waste yout time,A2FCDH5AN85R4U,"While the concept could be good, the awful dialogue, errors in grammar, and unbelievable situations were too much for me.  I didn't get past the 15% mark.  Thank goodness it was free."
"09 27, 2013",B001V9KG4E,1.0,The grammar and lack of editing makes it unreadable,A3DP6WV8KGESEV,"While the plot sounded great, the writing makes this book unreadable. I'm afraid I didn't even get through the first page.Based on the first couple paragraphs, it was clear the author didn't know how to use semicolons or commas; I can't read a book that makes my hand itch for a red pen.If such things don't bother you, then perhaps you can enjoy this book."
"10 13, 2009",B002RHP4N2,5.0,Wonderfully written,A2GHKTUUITHJYB,"I absolutely loved this story, it was well written and action packed, the author has a great imagination.  The characters were nicely defined and all of them were completely fleshed out.  You felt as though you knew each and every one of them.  Ditto on the locales, you could visualize each of the different places the book took place.My favorite part of the book is where Jake (the dad) had to make up or tell a story.  Sort of a story within a story.  These miniature tales were so entertaining and enthralling, I was almost disappointed that they didn't go on.The writing is very well done.  I know that this is his first published book, but there are more to come.  Count me in for the next one, Brad."
"04 10, 2014",B002ZVPTA8,3.0,Not your regular Sherlock Holmes tale!,A314SBQZWR9CU7,"Interesting story about Count Dracula asking for Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson's help finding his wife, Mina. It had the feel of an original story but when Watson is kidnapped and changed in a horrible way I thought it went too far. Overall it was a good read."
"10 26, 2013",B003100UBU,2.0,Could have been better!,A3S6YHRC5P0K8Y,"Martha is an empath and because of this a recluse. She buys an antique mirror with strange symbols on it and learns it is not all it appears to be, it leads her to the man of her dreams. Silas is a Scottish wolf shifter who spies Martha and recognizing her as his mate he convinces her to stay with him, then proceeds to capture her heart.The author writes a decent sentence the storyline is cohesive and the dialogue smooth. The steamy scenes were abundant, detailed, and sizzling, but I had some major problems with this book.First, I really don't like when a book goes from zero to one hundred in the first few pages. Martha and Silas were having sex before you even knew anything about their personalities or could form any kind of emotional attachment. Silas remains pretty two dimensional throughout. There was no build up, no flirting, no draw to help you feel the chemistry between them it was disappointing, and there were so many steamy scenes in the beginning that I started skipping through to get to the meat of the story.Second, Silas is described as the usual alpha male big, buff, and bad, most women's ideal fantasy man. Then Martha is described and she is plain and over weight.....now just hear me out. I understand that we all come in different shapes and sizes I am not perfect either but this is fantasy, so when I read I am visualizing the scene as the author describes it, why would I want to fantasize about a beautiful man having sex with an over weight unattractive woman. I want to leave the reality outside of my books, authors never design the lead man as scrawny, plain, and timid....that's because women wouldn't like it. I get that she is trying to appeal to the audience by saying here is a hot guy going for the everyday women, but throughout the book Martha is describing herself, an introvert with plain looks, hair, and an over weight figure and coming to terms with the fact that Silas doesn't care, but to me it disturbs the romance of the book....it's a turn off. I felt as though Martha really didn't like herself, so guess what I had a hard time liking her as well. If you are going to have a character described as less than ideal I would accept it much better if she were confident with what she has, not insecure. Make her big, sassy, and proud.Lastly, there really wasn't much to the book other than steamy scenes and that became tiresome if you took those out it would be a very short novella, so if you want an unemotional erotic romance then this book is for you. This is my first read by this author so maybe her other books are different, better? I got this for free and would be hard pressed to purchase any of her other books or continue this series. Enjoy!"
"08 18, 2013",B003AT10VQ,4.0,Not spectacular- but still good,A9HE6K0GB92J6,"I have been reading a lot of Donna Grant lately, and I do enjoy escaping into another world, but after a while the characters all start to sound the same. One thing I have noticed in all the books I have read so far is that all the female characters lick their lips and all the male characters run a hand down their faces. And all the male characters have some awful secret, while the female characters are dealing with terrible insecurity or some other BS, after awhile all the mamby pamby indecision between them starts to get a little tedious. The editors need to learn how to proofread, I have actually started to highlight all of the errors I have been finding. None of this is stopping me from reading the rest of the series though, you sort of get hooked on the characters and want to see what happens next. I have actually read the next two books in the series since I finished this one, and I would still recommend them, even if the editing errors do seem to be getting worse as I progress."
"11 26, 2010",B003FSTKBY,5.0,Can't stop reading.,A3UUKCZC7O8MKY,"I cannot stop reading this book over and over. This is such a great storyline. Main female character is very likeable. She's real and strong. The main male character was hot, strong and very sweet at the same time. He's very protective of her and his family. He is a true Alpha. Jianne Carlo won me over."
"07 11, 2010",B003IGDDGQ,5.0,Wasteland,A320TMDV6KCFU,"Kadira is a Wanderer.  She is untouchable, valued, and detested all in one.  To touch her means instant death and Kadira finds this satisfactory.  Her family murdered, she knows that she will never have the loving touch of a mate.  She refused to depend on anyone but herself and this had been highly successful thus far.  And then she meets Ezra.Ezra knows what Kadira is and he doesn't care.  She needs his knowledge in order to help her adopted people, but that is all - or so she says.  Ezra knows differently.  Her desire is evident in her eyes and for once he is going to take what he wants and doesn't care of the consequences.The more Kadira fights her feelings for Ezra, the more he desires her.  He loves her unconditionally and she makes him shudder with longing.  It was fun to watch Kadira realize this and learn to live with the knowledge that no matter what she did, that love would continue.New beginnings in the harsh land of the Wasteland shine through in The Wanderer.  Kadira and Ezra make an unlikely couple, but one deeply embedded in each other's hearts and mind.  I loved Crystal Jordan's mojo in this futuristic love story!TaliaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
"02 19, 2013",B003IWOC1U,3.0,Gotta wonder at reviews,APTITVI3ZZ3K3,Um this one was just plain weird. Wont give it a one star because i did like the main character in this one the vampire jude but beyound that not worth the money and not a keeper. Sorry i went by the ratings again and i really must not agree with alot of people sigh!
"11 6, 2012",B003IX0H1S,5.0,Strong-willed heroine without being spoiled - a rarity,A3RX1X5DO5GY2G,"Both hero and heroine are more like busy CEOs, taking care of their respective family estates and feeling trapped and frustrated doing it.  But thankfully the heir  to the dukedom has paired them together in holy matrimony sure that two such similar creatures would make each other happy.  What he didn't count on was the heroines resentment at having more to take care of since surely she will be expected to take over her new household  and she's never met a man who didn't need caring for either.  She may be married, but she doesn't have to like it.This is one of the few novels in which the heroine is allowed to hold herself apart from the sex, refusing to go one step beyond what is required until she has had the chance to evaluate, come to terms, accept and admire her counterpart, then love him."
"07 13, 2013",B003JBI0QS,3.0,Interesting Story....,A35CHV6Z75D672,"So Over You is an interesting book. Seventeen year old Layney Logan is part of the school newspaper that is about to no longer exist. In order to save the school newspaper, Layney will go on 12 different dates with 12 different guys for 2 reasons. Reason #1: For a calendar to sell & Reason #2: Layney will write an article on what a girl wants in a guy. There are so many emotions Layney is experiencing. She's a very strong character, but there's a reason why she acts the way she does.The book is super crazy (which is perfect). There's so much going on! When the book first began I thought this book was going to be light, but once you hit to the ending it becomes really intense. The book is super crazy. The secret that Layney reveals explains why she acts the way she does. It really broke my heart...I felt so bad for her.The ending....Oh. My. Gosh. I was really upset! It ended so abrupt. As you're reading the ending your like ""DUH...you've felt that way for ever!"", but then you turn the next page and it just ended. No follow-up, no nothing! Overall, I think the book deserves anywhere between 3-3.5 stars."
"06 11, 2014",B003NSBPJQ,4.0,An Amusing Freebie,A2AIE9DO5QSVBD,"Let's be clear here. This is a short short story and it's free. As a freebie, it's a perfectly fine tidbit.  Between Hal Spacejock and Hal Junior, Simon Haynes has dozens of books available on Amazon; he also has a few other short stories that are usually also free and are worth tracking down from the author's Amazon page.This story has some interesting twists and turns and is a bit of a goof on hard science and conspiracy thriller books, but that's what makes it a tasty little treat. It's nice to see a sci-fi author having a few chuckles and as it's a freebie I'm glad the author decided to share."
"06 12, 2010",B003NX7BWG,4.0,Motor City Fae,A16BPF2Y7B8A2G,"Artist Meagan Kelly has always had a feel for things. She knew when good or bad things were about to happen. She never knew why she could sense these things, but she always took them for what they were. When hunky Ric Thornhill tells her it's because she's half-elf, it is a lot to take in but she doesn't have a hard time believing him at his word. A new world is opened up for her, one where she has enemies that don't want her to take part in the important vote being held by the Seelie council.I loved this story! I have read previous titles from this author so I was pretty positive I'd enjoy this new one. I really liked the meeting of Ric and Meagan. From the moment they cross paths they are attracted to each other. Their attraction is fierce and electric. The story is set in Detroit, which I liked. It was a nice change. I haven't read any stories set there, at least none that I recall. Motor City Fae is filled with intense, sensual scenes. Spencer Pape has created an interesting world that is inhabited by not just fae - but also healers, magic users and shifters. I look forward to reading more about these characters. Wonderfully paced. A captivating read, that keeps you wanting more."
"04 10, 2013",B003O2SGTI,3.0,I just didn't enjoy the style of this book,A2VXSQHJWZAQGY,I just readFalling for Graceand I liked that book very much but I can't believe that the same author wrote this book. The beginning was a bit abrupt and I wondered if I'd missed a previous book but it does become a little clearer as we get further into the book. It was a light read with a sweet hea but it just wasn't fantastic.
"01 17, 2011",B003R7L3FO,5.0,Babel,AXQN6BEO8ILKY,Highly recommended read and very intriguing story about life after the Flood. Spelling and grammatical errors are consistent throughout and needs to be fixed.
"12 22, 2012",B003SX0Y1G,5.0,About sex,A473D9BPI0GZ5,"It is about sex but surprisingly a twist at the end, that it is not just about sex but also something else."
"06 25, 2010",B003SX12B2,4.0,Cute Christmas short story,A2F98UKV7RF6MR,"The title of the review is all I will say about this. If I say anything of the story, it will give it away. It was a 5 minute read for me, if that, but it is a complete story in and of itself."
"09 13, 2011",B003TU24ZW,4.0,"Quick, Easy, and Enjoyable Read",A3M2XWZ7SMFBS1,"I'm a fan of Andrew Grey's other books and decided recently to check out his Spot Me/Work Out series. As of right now, the series consists of six books. While they don't need to be read in order to be enjoyed, I do know that Pump Me Up (book 2) contains characters from Spot Me (book 1), so there is some overlap. Regardless, you won't be ""lost"" if you read out of order; stuff may make more sense, though.Spot MePump Me Up (Spot Me)Core TrainingCrunch Time (Work Out)Positive Resistance (Work Out)Personal Training (Work Out)Spot Me is a quick read. It's a M/M romance novella, so if you are wanting complex plots and extremely detailed characterizations, this is not the book for you. However, if you want a quick, enjoyable read, it's a worthy purchase.While the sex scenes are hot, they are few and far between. Grey chooses to focus more on the budding romance between the two main characters, and he does so in such a manner so the story is completely believable and realistic. Dan and Gene are physical opposites and, just as in the real world, have a hard time figuring out what each sees in the other. While their conversations can be trite at times, each figures out the connection is based on more than mere physical attraction and works hard to develop a well-rounded relationship.I look forward to finishing the remainder of the series and hope character development and detail are improved in future installments."
"09 6, 2012",B003U4WB7I,4.0,I love this series,A2W2EII47LXBT2,"Lije I said, I love this series of stories. This one is a little short story that bridges the time between two novels. I feel very protective of the ongoing characters in this series, and I would have just loved to smack Maggie's nasty sister in this story. The books are entertaining and enjoyable."

"02 8, 2014",B003URRS6E,5.0,Great book!,A4IJPMOB4JUZP,"That Which is Human was a great read.

"07 29, 2013",B003WQBG0C,5.0,Touching and riveting,A1HQV337W8SI1Y,"The best historical novels draw you in and make you feel like you've been there. The best historical biblical fiction does the same, with one caveat--the next time you open your bible, you see it clearer, you can imagine the people better, you identify with the experiences more. And that's just what A Stray Drop of Blood does. The author did an expert job of making the characters accessible, real and easy to identify with. I loved Abigail's story. Her road to trust and faith in a loving creator rings true and has stayed with me long after I've finished the book."

"09 27, 2011",B003Y5H664,4.0,A fun laugh out loud version of Pride and Prejudice,A22SB9HXP1XSXF,"To really enjoy this book, it is necessary to be acquainted with either the book or movies of Pride and Prejudice. I loved this version: the vision of Mr. Collins made me laugh out loud and how they dealt with Wickham was much more satisfying than the original."

"06 10, 2014",B0041G6MSS,3.0,"A Summary of the Empirical Thought of Hitchens, Dawkins and Harris.",APAVVKD3AUCUZ,"The title of the review is practically the only review required.  This collection of essays is simply a simplified restatement of the writers mentioned.  As a primer for the basic reasoning behind the atheistic world view this works well, but one would be better off reading Christopher Hitchens', Richard Dawkins' and Sam Harris' books."

It's well written too and not long enough to get stale.I'm not sure how much I would really consider the main character a submissive.  She's pretty ballsy for a sub, but the Doms don't seem to mind.  Outside of one spanking scene it's more about exhibitionism/swinging than it is D/s.Having said all of that, it's a very enjoyable read."

"12 30, 2010",B0045OUDOK,5.0,On the Stump in America,A3KOWKCU9ZDGYO,"Abraham Lincoln may have made the stump speech famous, but it's likely he did it without campaign staff and speech writers. The main character in Stumbling Forward, Alex Hogan, would have trouble finding the toilet without professional help. American politics has changed since the old days. TV, Radio, and a Pepsodent smile have made any(thing)one electable.Author Christopher Truscott is an outstanding writer. As a thriller author myself, I am always on the lookout for a new writer who provides a good story, well-developed characters, and a memorable ride through the pages. Truscott does it in spades and pulls the reader along with him on the journey, each page telling an almost unbelievable story of political ineptness, uncaring ""pick me, pick me"" attitude, and the hundreds, thousands, nay millions of dollars that are spent in pursuit of . . . what?Perhaps most telling (since Truscott admits in the closing narrative to being an occasional campaign manager himself) is the fact that as I finish this book, I am not quite certain if the author is a republican or democrat.  He does not use Stumbling Forward to further a political agenda, philosophical posture, or ""save the world"" message. He equally describes the best arguments for Left and Right. In fact he skewers pinheads and patriots equally, (choice is yours) without apparent remorse, yet he does so with great humor, absent vitriol. Perhaps that comes from his background as a journalist. A REAL journalist. You remember, the kind that used to tell the story supported by facts and not by ideology.Stumbling Forward is actually an indictment of the American political system (not democracy, but politics) as it is played out by both parties. Some outstanding, honorable people surface in the pages of journal-like narrative, but for the most part, partisan efforts outweigh policy or for that matter, perspective.This novel should be required reading for college freshmen taking Political Science. I know that in my PolySci courses, no one ever mentioned that putting a fool in office - - a fool with the correct party label - - was preferable to electing someone who might commit to the people and the nation s/he is elected to serve.Written with the knowledge only an insider can obtain, Truscott takes no prisoners, yet he does it in such a way as to soften the blow. We like these people, even the fools. God help us if we actually have ""Alex Hogans"" in Congress, but I believe that we do, on both sides of the aisle.Well done, Mr. Truscott.  I look forward to the next edition of the Great American Game. I only hope that your fictional campaign staffers find someone worthy of their effort.Gordon Ryan, Author"

"05 21, 2011",B00480OPOK,4.0,Training Wheels,ASSPNKIEXHR8,"As I understand it: This book is one of the first if not ""the first"" published work for Indie author Penelope Fletcher. Keeping this in the forefront while writing this review, I think she did good work.My Review:The story moved along at a decent pace. The main character was fantastic. We learn a great deal about Rea during the full length of the book. It's a discovery not just for the reader but also a discovery for and of Rea herself. Her decisions shape who she is throughout the book, she continuously develops. I especially like this. After all this is how we develop in reality. The decisions, choices,actions, and responses we make daily are what makes us who we are. Sometimes we think we know what we would do given a situation yet ounce the choice is ours in reality our decision may differ. I really enjoyed the telling of this story.Let's talk about PF's main characters and the set up:The main character is Rea. I can really envision Rea. Rea comes across as a morning person. Takes daily runs and enjoys the opportunity for some alone time, She'd always felt the odd one. Rea was unawares of her family history and had nothing but a coin on a cord left of her life pre cleric. She's had no romantic dealings in her past and has one BFF Alex. Alex and Rea are the best of friends and probably the only person near and dear to Rea's heart. In Rea's world higher education means becoming a cleric. Learning of demons such as witches, fairies, vampires, shape shifters, how to protect herself and home from these enemies, etc. Rea's adventure is two days length. Two rather LONG days, this did not warrant a fuss imho.  During this adventure she meets several demons. Learns of her family past and gets her fortune told by a teenager. The future holds hardship for Rea personally. Many extreme circumstances, important decisions, and a harsh reality comes into view. Her importance and law she is not familiar with are to dictate her behavior. This idea alone is unrealistic in of itself. How can one be expected to immediately bend themselves to a ""law"" one just discovered? Utter, ridiculousness. Although I am of the mind this was the authors intent. In any case I am sure we have all heard the saying history repeats itself. I believe this to be the case for Rea, her beaus, and to some extent her spices.Speaking of Rea's beaus....We have two Rea has bonded with. Oh and just to keep things interesting these men are demons. Beau #1 we run into (inside joke) is while lost amongst the woods is a lovely looking fairy. He talks in riddles, takes procession of her, (you belong to me) and promptly returns Rea to her original destination. But not before he warns her of the danger awaiting outside her secluded and ""protected"" school grounds. Gives her orders to stay put 'till he returns to gather her up. Beau #1 came across as pushy but intriguing. Rea felt confused by the encounter.Beau #2 is a vampire whom beau #1 has warned Rea of. Beau #2 is not as easy on the eyes as Beau #1. Beau #2 is obsessed with talking to her. Seems he has important news to share. News imperative they discuss. By the time we meet said vampire the sun is about to make an appearance. This results in Rea hiding Beau #2 in her wardrobe and promising to return after her classes. I loved that part! Beau #2 came across as a mystery man and set off ""bells"" in my head.Rea seems the popular girl but normally this is not the case. As she continues with her day, she shows up rather unnerved to early morning class. During class one we meet her best friend Alex. Alex is a simple character really. Her demeanor reminded me of the majority in her age group.We also meet the bad guy during day one of two. I am not going to say much about him. I do not want to spoil the surprises ahead should you decide to give this book a go.Room for improvement: I will say Penelope Fletcher was in need of experience editorial work. As noted by a previous reviewer PF's ""Demon Girl"" had several grammar and misspelling issues. The fight scenes in particular warranted some confusion.  I'd find myself a little bewildered and have to carefully read it a second time. This is something the author needs to work on should she want to continue building her fan base. When I read a book I want to be transported to the main character's world. I cannot do that if I am making a concentrated effort to read carefully.Overall feeling: This is a free installment and freshmen work. I will be on the look out for the following installment (2) and decide at that time if I am fond of her ""Rea Wilder"" series. A lot is dependent on Penelope Fletcher producing a clean and professional piece of ebook literature. At this point I will remind myself she is still in training wheels.*A note the author: Ms. Penelope Fletcher if this really is a career choice and not a hobby, I'd suggest practice and a fanatical eye. Remember one can be born with a lovely voice yet never become a successful singing artist. It takes forethought, dedication and a brilliant team. Please invest in your work. I can tell you have talent. I do love the world you have built and can truly see glimpses of Rea Wilder that intrigue me. Ms. Fletcher I'd like to become a loyal fan. *I recommend this e book. It is a quick and engaging story. Great for reading while in the waiting room for your Doc.  Being I feel generous I give this book a 3.5.I wish Ms. Penelope Fletcher much success in the future.Question: Any one know when the second installment is scheduled to be released??"

He&#8217;s a vampire and she hates vampires. But for two years she&#8217;s had to work side-by-side with him because the agency said she had to. Now, after one last mission she&#8217;ll be free to go. She&#8217;ll finally be free of her vampire partner, a reminder of everything she lost. But is she really ready to go? And will Rafe let her walk away without telling her how he feels about her?An excellent short story about two broken people falling in love. So what if one&#8217;s a vampire and the other has been traumatized by one? I love great characters who can overcome difficulties to find their HEA and still manage to work together to do their jobs. Because that gross slimy snot demon is not going to sit around twiddling his um, thumbs(?) while they work out their feelings."

"06 5, 2012",B004BA5GPY,4.0,Liking the Viking,A2WHV0YLBOK0I0,"Set aside a dose of credulity, and enjoy a romantic trip to Viking territory.  Beautiful English twins, Gwendolyn (the tomboy) and Anora (the delicate one), are kidnapped by Hakon, a Viking captain.  The twins decide their best chance of escape requires Gwendolyn to impersonate a boy.  Hakon is captivated by Anora, and he makes it clear he intends to have his way with her, but she is already betrothed.  In order to spare her more fragile sister, Gwendolyn decides to impersonate Anora, and she instructs Anora to impersonate the boy that Gwendolyn has been impersonating.  Are you confused yet?  Hang in there - it's worth it!The impersonation angle was unique and a clever way to increase the romantic tension.  It seemed unnecessary and possibly detrimental, however, (Hakon is gallant, and the sister impersonating the boy would surely have received better treatment if Hakon knew the truth) and it was just one of those things I decided to ignore so I could enjoy the story.  We know the girls will eventually be discovered, but we don't know how, and we don't know how Hakon will respond to the deception.The story was exciting, with some unexpected moments and some expected moments I could have done without, including one villain who kept popping up like Jason from Friday the Thirteenth.  These are minor issues, though, and the book is easy to recommend because there is a lot that is done well.  The most important aspect in a romance novel for me is a likable hero and heroine, and ""Twin Passions"" succeeds in that regard.  I'm intrigued to read more from Miriam Minger."

Even if it's hard to read it's still erotic, but with very strong emotions throughout every scene. Overall, despite this kind of story not generally being 'my thing' it was still a great read. I wanted to give this book 5 stars, emotionally it deserves 5 stars ... BUT ...  { ~ ~ SPOILERS!!! - you have been warned and I'm as vague as possible!  ~ ~ SPOILERS!!! ~ ~ } ultimately the way, the character Tania settles with The Discovery when she speaks with Gail felt weak and quickly wrapped up and rushed. So much so, that it killed a star for me. On the other hand, in a positive review note, the depth of emotions in the story, in the 're-do', the depth of the pain was almost too hard to read, but it was a good thing. It felt real and harsh. Amazing writing."

I can see how less than a page horror shorts work for some people and the author does an excellent job of revealing the inner-id of a great many psychopaths in less than 100 words or so but these are more &#34;pop out and scare you&#34; than the long suspense and horror I prefer.

"01 23, 2012",B004JN0KA4,5.0,A Must Read Historical Romance Serial Novel,A2WAERNN7HSU1M,"*I received this book for review from author. Since The Rake and a Recluse is a serial series, I have read and reviewed parts 1-3 together. Read the full review at: [...]*Review Thoughts on the series:Jenn LeBlanc's photography interspersed throughout the story only enhances the story. Illustrated novels are a very new concept (as far as I know, unique to Jenn LeBlanc), but with both visually stunning photographs and impressive writing Jenn LeBlanc has created a new format for a literary masterpiece.Each installment of this series is uniquely crafted to focus the storyline and engage readers. With the story broken into segments, the reader is able to really learn each of the characters and understand the setting. The reader is transported from the pages of the book into the story.Review for part 2:This segment picks up right where Freedom ends. The Duke is on his way to London, where he meets with his brother, Lord Peregrine Trumbull, the rake. Gideon and Perry discuss their lives and Gideon confesses that he is very drawn to his new ""guest."" As Gideon spends more time in London, he realizes that his thoughts are never far from Francine and he can't wait to return to her. Meanwhile, Francine is now free to roam the estate and she befriends the new architect, Shaw who is able to speak with her using sign language. The Duke and his brother arrive home in time to learn the truth of who Francine really is, and front then on, everyone's lives are changed.Found is once again an appropriate theme for this segment of the story. Not only is Francine's identity discovered, but both Francine and Gideon realize who they are to each other. They both discover their counterpart, and a new relationship is begun. The pull between the pair is electric, they communicate with every look, touch, and glance. With the new scene added in, the necessity for Gideon to behave in a ""proper"" manner is made very clear. There is so much to the overall story of the Rake and The Recluse, it is more than a love story of one couple. The Duke and his brother have a strong brotherly relationship and sense of family, they befriend the lower class architect, and Lord Trumbull suddenly has an entirely new set of responsibilities. As Found comes to an end, the stage is set for a new chapter in this saga, and I had to read part 3, Taken, immediately."

Imagine it coming from a sexy cowboy. Are you melting? Then you need to read Cowboy Easy.I've read lots of great reviews on the work of Stormy Glenn. I had to find out for myself what the buzz was all about. I'm glad I did. I'm a sucker for white hot man on man action and Asa and Lachlan are super hot. I felt like I was right there with them and had to know what would happen next.Both are strong men and I couldn't help but smile when they met. Okay, so it wasn't the most marshmallowy sweet meeting. That's fine. I loved reading about them learning each other and having red-hot sex.There were a couple of issues. I found myself more than once being pulled from the story because there was a good deal of telling rather than showing. As much as I felt like I was there, I didn't feel like I was in the characters' shoes. I also wanted to get into the characters' heads more than I did. But, it didn't keep me from enjoying the book. Far from it.The action-packed plot has twists and turns I didn't see coming and I'm glad.

"06 20, 2012",B004SY664S,4.0,intelligent writing,A1IMRQN25R166H,"This novel was intelligently written as are all the Simeon Grist stories. I always learn something from them (sometimes with a dictionary). This time it touched on fire symbolism in religions with a little bit of mythology thrown in. That just added to the story, not detracted from it. The characters were ""real"" people. I thought ""Incinerator"" was not as good as ""Skin Deep"" but it was still a great mystery and I liked it."

"05 15, 2011",B004WEKR1W,4.0,"A delightful, engaging and slightly creepy prequel novella",A1ZHEK7NJJWKE9,"The Strange Case of Finley Jayne is the delightful, engaging and slightly creepy prequel novella to The Girl in the Steel Corset. This short story, which reads like a standalone tale, introduces readers to Finley Jayne, the main character in the full-length novel.In this story, which takes place just before the full-length novel begins, readers follow along with Finley as she takes a job as the companion to Phoebe, who is engaged to the much older, wealthy and slightly eccentric inventor, Lord Vincent. As her companion, Finley grows to care for and befriend Phoebe and begins to worry about Lord Vincent's true intentions.The Strange Case of Finley Jayne offers up a few surprises about the main character and takes a few twists and turns as readers learn about just what Lord Vincent is up to.Author Kady Cross does a remarkable job in setting up this world filled with automatons and a wide assortment of steampunk inventions. Readers will get a feel for her characters and writing style, as she gradually reveals tidbits about Finley over the course of this story.The writing is elegant and has a great flow, and the author casually but so cleverly manages to drop in each new piece of the puzzle about Finley, while still teasing readers for the soon-to-be-released novel.This prequel novella is a great introduction to the author and The Girl in the Steel Corset and it is recommended to be read prior to reading the novel.On a personal note:I just loved this short story. This was my first taste of steampunk and I have to say I'm really intrigued and completely excited about starting The Girl in the Steel Corset. I can't wait to know more about steampunk and delve deeper into Finley's world.I was completely surprised the first time the author mentioned one of the inventions, as I was so caught up in the story that I forgot that there even was this aspect to it.And I absolutely loved that as time went on there were these casual mentions about Finley's unique attributes that really made me wonder what more there is to know.All I can say about Lord Vincent is, ""Ew, creepy!""I hope to see more about a certain character only briefly talked about, and although I'm sure things won't get easier for Finley, I hope things end up okay in the end.I really got to like Finley over the course of this short story. She has a practical but caring nature and has both a good side and a bad side which appear depending on the situation. She is definitely a heroine I really want to know more about over the course of this new series."

'Antium' is an advanced civilization under the grips of a theocracy, and protagonist Stalling Alterian must face it down, whatever the costs. 'The Provider' is a spiritual and natural world, and its guardian, Steffor, faces an epic battle against an ancient evil. The parallels between the two worlds are what make this story memorable.

Fortunately, my skepticism was grossly misplaced. This book was funny, adventurous and entirely consuming. I thoroughly enjoyed it.

"11 22, 2011",B004ZUS6DY,2.0,Left Me High and Dry,A88USYRFGDUTK,"At its core, this is a story about a one night stand in a cabin in the woods.  There's no romance, no small talk, and nothing steamy or wild in the book (except maybe some critters that might be out in the woods).  The author writes intelligently enough but the structure and point of view of the story make it difficult for the reader to get and stay engaged.  Melody has three paragraphs and then Chris has three and then Melody again... back and forth, and back again... eventually, I lost track of who's thoughts I was reading (because there's not a whole lot of talking).  Maybe they were telepathic and I missed that part?In all honesty, I was so bored with this story that I started playing with the text-to-speech feature on my Kindle and let it read the rest to me while I puttered around on the computer.  I hate to not finish a book.  You're about 65% through the story before one of them starts actually making moves on the other.  Given that this is supposed to be a short, erotic story, that's far too late.  There's a lot of narrative that they each have about how much they want the other person, what they'd like to do, etc.  I suppose this is meant to add to the erotic nature of the story, but, after 6,000+ words of wanting and fantasy, it just comes across as petulant and pedantic.  Get on with it.As others mentioned, there is no discussion of protection, before or after their interlude, nor does our white knight even think about pulling out.  In the end, it's a one night stand - what does he care?  Some have mentioned rough sex, but I didn't find it all that rough or aggressive... she makes a flirty comment, after he called her feisty, that maybe she likes it rough... and he figures that means she's not overly interested in foreplay and get to it... finally.  For me, the sex wasn't all that hot... it was pretty run of the mill.Usually there's a disclaimer in the product description but since there isn't one on this book, readers be warned that the story contains anal play if that is offensive to you.  Finally, a note to the author - approximately 60% of women in America are overweight (with 33% classified as obese).  While that may not be something to be proud of, it is a fact, and those women don't want to read a story where the hero thinks of a woman who might look like they do as a means to turn himself off.  You might keep that in mind for your next story.In the end, if this story were shorter or if it had more actual action, it might have been better."
"05 1, 2014",B004ZZGUAA,4.0,WereMouse?-Had to read it!,AG2Y801R2R1DS,"Do you like the occasional lighthearted but still paranormal read? I do and when I found this book for free,and read what it was about, I was in. It&#8217;s novella length but you can get the whole series of five bundled at a reasonable price. Jen is a were-mouse born into a wolf family. That seemed really different, which believe me is becoming more important to me now with all the same sorts of books being published-over and over.So okay, a were-mouse that hides in a closet during each full moon for fear she will become a werewolf snack. She considers herself a kind of black sheep in her family of wolves. She works as an assistant at a real estate office, where her boss Rob, is a werewolf. She is madly in love with him and he, well he has a different full moon date each month, while looking for a mate. To Jen&#8217;s disgust, he sometimes spends the full moon nights at the office. When Rob realizes that Jen must be interested in him after one such occasion, he asks her out for the next full moon date-of course not knowing she is a mouse. Jen&#8217;s best friend Ali, is a raccoon shifter and couldn&#8217;t be more happy with herself. True to her inner animal nature, she is constantly getting into trouble and taking Jen along for the ride. When Ali steals an magical amulet that can make a person change into a wolf, it could be just the thing Jen needs for a full moon date with Rob. Let&#8217;s just say, things get really interesting at this point.This ended up being a really cute and even humorous read. I enjoyed Jen and Rob&#8217;s relationship, and the character of Ali was just a really fun part of the read. The world these characters live in is a world where the supernatural element is not hidden. A vampire is introduced at one point and as much as I love vampire characters, this vampire is described as really pasty faced and looking as dead as he really is-nothing glamorous here. I think the second book of the series may feature him, although it also features Rob and Jen.As soon as I finished this, I immediately bought and downloaded the When,Were and Howl collection bundle because it was just such a fun read and I wanted to continue with the story. I read so many books that are full of killings, and vicious villains and creatures, sometimes it&#8217;s just fun to relax and read a feel good story. This totally fit the bill for me.FYI I am not sure if the series is finished yet.(RabidReads.com)"
"09 18, 2011",B005007GHA,4.0,Scott Fitzgerald Gray's Clearwater Dawn,A108N5CZ8KQ5W8,"Clearwater Dawn is a book I really wanted to love. It has lovely cover art, the description sounds exciting, and the prose is fluid and almost poetic in places. There was just so much potential here, but I feel that on the whole this first book in a projected series failed to live up to it all.The story follows one Chriani, an apprentice bodyguard of sorts. There is a fairly complex military structure going on here, so it is difficult to place him exactly on the scale, but he's near the bottom and serving directly under a man near the very top. Anyhow, his master is killed, which opens the doorway to an entire conspiracy that threatens to claim not only Chriani's life but the life of the Princess Lauresa and the High Prince Chanist-or does it? There are a lot of twists and turns in the plot here, and Chriani spends more than half the book either defying the orders of authority or nearly dead as a result of his defiance.Despite how that sounds, this is not a book that trips from action-packed moment to action-packed moment. One of the biggest drawbacks I felt was the amount of exposition that slows the story down continually. This is most notable in the first ten to twenty percent of the novel, and is a reason why I almost did not pick this one up after sampling. While it does not necessarily take very long for anything to start happening, it seems like forever because of the amount of back story the reader is constantly forced to slog through. That is the chief of my complaints here, though.The plot itself is straightforward and could have been almost too linear were it not for some good twists that come later on. Mr. Gray does a fine job of throwing out red herrings, and does so convincingly enough that one is easily drawn into Chriani's way of thinking, missing the truth because believing the lie is so much easier. The astute reader-or the reader familiar with mystery novels-may be able to figure out the truth of things before Chriani does, as the clues are there, but again I think Mr. Gray has done a fine job in shielding the truth and holding revelations nicely in reserve for the climax.After the enormous amount of exposition, the greatest issue I had with the reading of this novel is the names. Many of them are just too familiar, and after the first chapter it all sort of blurred together. The result was that I ultimately could not follow much of the back story, being constantly confused as to who was who and which nation was which. This does not affect the plot so much, however, as the only primary characters with similar names are Chriani (the hero) and Chanist (the aforementioned High Prince). Still, even though the primary plot was not weighed down by similar-sounding names, it would have been nice to follow the back story more easily, especially since there is just so much of it.Lastly, the characters themselves are all mostly believable, and they all have their secrets. While the back story is difficult to grab hold of, I think it's very clear that there is a whole host of history that is influencing the present. Rare are the fantasy novels that do so good a job at showing the present as a result of the past. The characters bear their burdens, shielding secrets from each other, even from those they trust the most, and this creates some wonderful tension and dramatic irony throughout. It can get a bit frustrating, and I sometimes wanted to shout at Chriani for one reason or another, but I was always reminded that his behaviour is a result of his past and not simply random. The third-person narrative is told exclusively from Chriani's perspective, which is an aid to the mystery-type nature of the plot, but does also leave me feeling I'd like to have known more about a few of the other characters who, as a result, were not so fully fleshed out as he.At the end of the day, Clearwater Dawn is a decent distraction. The writing is consistently crisp and evocative, and the plot should keep you on the edge of your seat throughout. The novel is hampered by some almost unforgivable issues (in my opinion), and so it is with great difficulty that I arrive at a value judgement out of five stars. Some of the problems could irreparably cripple a lesser book, but the climax redeems in this case. It is a true saying that we remember endings more clearly than beginnings, and in this case the tight conclusion of Clearwater Dawn makes up nicely for any shortfalls that precede it."
"11 29, 2013",B00507GMIM,3.0,Good basic information for new dog owners,AVR0HXZEC0BQ9,"This book had some good basic information for new puppy owners from an expert who raises puppies. She takes a tough (not mean, but firm) stance with her puppies, which probably most new dog owners would benefit from following. Many dog problems come from babying pups, which we all know is so tempting to do.However, even though the book was short, it was a little repetitious and would profit from some good editing. Tip: if your sentences include the phrase, &#34;as I say&#34;, you probably don't need to say it again and again. I think it was a little too basic for me but I'd recommend it to someone who had never had a puppy before."

There was no way I was going to pass on this offer. I was very glad she gave us, her diehard fans, these extra chapters of the books that will stay with me for a long time. It was so nice to revisit this loving family and catch up with everyone. For some, it may be lacking, but for me, it was pure indulgence to find out how they are and finally I was able to say a proper goodbye to Dudley's."

A Faerie is cast out to become a heroine in our world. True Druids join in the fight between the Fae - on both sides. Ms Drummond creates an exciting new series line. The story is wonderful, but not as wonderful as the writing.

This is good writing here, reminding me of John Updike.  It's stayed with me, one of the best openers I've seen.A series of vignettes follows, some better than others, each ending in a time.  This is a countdown.I liked this book, but I do wish the writing had been as consistently high as in the first few chapters.Recommended."
"11 15, 2011",B0052O4N84,3.0,I wished it was longer.,A26J2TRDPZH7RZ,"Review by Jen: The premise of this intrigued me enough to take a read.  While characters with physical limitations are showing up more often in books, it still isn't the norm.  So, when I saw that the main female character is blind and the male lead is scarred, I was curious to see how it was going to play out.The main problem with this book is it's length.  There's not enough time for the reader to get to know the characters, there's not enough tension between Belle and Adam, and then the story just seems to resolve too easily. All that said, the book is well written and feels like a solid beginning to a story, ad one can only hope that the author will revisit this story and expand on it."

"10 1, 2011",B0052ZAV9S,2.0,alpha a bit to mean,A33GQGX7TANJST,"First off, this author has done an excellent job of her writing. It is carefully edited and obviously she took time to make sure it flowed well together. I think you will either love this or hate it though. I love love love an alpha male, but Travis is a bit beyond alpha male and just plane mean at times and instead of just being really possessive and strong, he tends to be mean and forceful. For example the line ""And when you get back to the house, you better make me something real sweet for dessert, because i want something for all the goddamn trouble you're causing me"". He says this after she was worried about him and so brought him a lunch to where he was working and then grabbed her to make out and she pushed him back when it went to far.Like I said, i love an alpha male, however he really looks at her like she owes him, and I don't like that. She should not have to trade sex for him helping her out. I think she is a great character with depth and character, but I would think she would be afraid of him and not feel any desire.I do want to stress again that the writer does an amazing job of writing, and some may really love this story, especially those that love the alpha male, but he was over the top in meanness for me."
"08 28, 2011",B0053GSDOG,4.0,Cat and mice,A37PV5GMP2ILJC,"The second book in the Detective Manny Williams series continues three months after the cliff hanger ending to book one, where a dangerous sociopath plays cat and mouse with Lansing's finest during a trip to the Caribbean.The serial killer of the moment has resurfaced, and so has an unidentified vigilante killer group working hard at taking the dregs out of society.  To the Caribbean and back, this page turner dives deep into personal territory for Detective Williams and his team, and the author has you guessing at every step of the journey.Gruesome torture and painful death are never more than a few pages away, and the perpetrators are the most unlikely group you can imagine. While book one was more intriguing, this one piles on the action and is recommended for murder mystery junkies.The ending sets the stage for the next book, which hopefully won't be long in the making.Amanda Richards, August 28, 2011"

I thought I knew who the killer was, but she kept that from me, and masterfully, too.Sydney Blackburn and Jake Radley are compelling characters, both trying to do the right thing, but in opposite ways.  I liked them as people, both imperfectly clinging to their own truths while being open enough to understand the other's position.  Their coming together was explosive and a romance you won't soon forget.  Read it now!!!"
"01 30, 2012",B00558VIBC,5.0,Seven old West tales featuring old fashion justice.,AUX9KZUUB3YCE,"""Adventures of Cash Laramie and Gideon Miles"" is a work of fiction by author Edward A. Grainger. This Kindle e-book  is a 412 Kb download (approx 71 pages) and is priced at $0.99.This short  book is made up of seven different stories featuring Federal Marshals, Cash Laramie and Gideon Miles. The setting is in the midwestern state of Wyoming in the mid late 1800's...a time when life was really tough and quite often lawless.The tales presented are short vignettes of justice dealt out with a personal style reflecting the moral makeup of our heroes. They may not always come out unscathed, but their brand of 'marshaling' deals out a type of recompense that will seem to the reader, not only fitting, but somehow ultimately satisfying. I remember myself thinking, 'I wish we had a little more of this in today's world'.My favorite story...""Melanie"".Cover Art...in the style of an old West ""Wanted"" poster...very appropriate.Conclusion:Seven different tale of the old west: all well told and concisely written.5 Stars.Ray Nicholson"
"07 5, 2011",B0055HYTUK,5.0,Superb sci-fi short,A2CYKUKKUVMGS9,"Freefall is a thoroughly enjoyable and deeply engaging short story that gives the reader a glimpse into the colourful life of Hammer Mehran.One of the story's great strengths is that it is equally effective for those who have read Space Turbulence and newcomers to the Kolian Chronicles. This is because the author's storytelling abilities are hugely impressive.I will not give too much of the plot away, but needless to say the book begins in hilarious circumstances but soon shifts gears to be a pulsating drama that will have you losing yourself in the author's skilled writing.This is a great introduction to Alex Le Soum's writing and is a highly recommended read."

I could not wait to read more from Gallowglas, and started this trilogy (which I picked up when offered for free for the kindle).This series was much darker and not nearly as much to my liking as 'Flute'. I finished this first volume hoping that I would care enough about what would happen to continue the trilogy.  However, I think I'm moving on to something else.Numerous people, factions, beings, etc are introduced quickly and it's somewhat hard to keep track of - only to find that some (many?) do not survive.  The world seems well-built, but is at first difficult to follow. The characters may develop deeper later on, but I'm not vested enough to continue.I won't say it's bad, but just not my cup of tea at this time..."

"12 9, 2011",B0057QNWCA,3.0,Mixed reaction,A263UA9W8JV38J,"I'm a little confused by my reaction to this book. I liked so many things about it: the first person point of view; the narrator's casual, friendly tone; the story's brevity, as well as some of the author's descriptions. For example: ""Nipples like pencil erasers..."" The story's plot also moves along nicely. Yet, I find myself emotionally `unaffected' by the story. Perhaps it's because it's told from a male perspective; perhaps I'm better able to relate to a female protagonist. Either way, and I say this respectfully, understanding the effort this author has put into the story, for me, as the reader, I just needed more."

I was fascinated as to how the story of a rockabilly witch could merge into that of a paranormal romance; my fascination soon turned into real enjoyment.What I really enjoyed about this book, alongside the originality of the idea for the main plot, was the quirkiness of it all; the characters, the humour, the many twists and turns... and I must admit that I am one of those annoying readers who usually spot the red herrings and work out the ending early on, but Pressey successfully managed to keep me guessing and pretty clueless until the end - yeah Rose!If you have yet to read one of Rose Pressey's novels, then this book is a good place to start.

Holy moly!So here's the run down...Spencer, a sexy, controlling, workaholic, has had the hots for his sarcastic, modestly sexy, employee, Kelly from her first day at the Book Nook three years ago.Since college, Kelly has wanted to break away from her inner good girl and made a list of her top ten men to, uhhh, ""cuddle,"" to help her do just that. Once she meets Spencer, she immediately makes him her number one - and if she can't have him...she can at least fantasize about him...at home, in her dreams, on the couch in his office... ;)I really...REALLY enjoyed this book. The beginning was a little bit typical - boy likes girl, girl likes boy and everybody but the two of them are aware of it. But in true Cari Quinn style, we soon get wrapped into a delicious, sexy, moving relationship between two real characters.Kelly is my type of chick - we would totally be cool. She's a book enthusiast who has a knack for design and I love the quirkiness of her character. She's oober sarcastic and literally made me laugh out loud multiple times with her needling of Spencer. Moreover, I appreciated the control she had over her feelings. Kelly isn't a cry-about-it kinda gal, and man, I LOVE it! Even when she does get emotional, it's in the right places, showing natural openness and honesty.Spencer's made some choices that have shaped his life and influenced his work ethic but still were necessary, as are all cruddy choices, for his growth. I loved how callus Spencer was. It really fit and made sense not only in his relationship with Kelly, but with his familial relationships as well.The sex club was prevalent in the beginning of the book (and boy was it steamy!) continuing occasionally throughout but the one-on-ones between Spencer and Kelly were just as tantalizing, allowing us to make sense of a how this world could REALLY work - although most of us only fantasize about it.As the issues arise in their relationship, the reader can definitely see where Quinn is leading us, it's the waiting to get there that caused so much angst for me. I literally cried on and off throughout the last four chapters - which was super awkward because the UPS guy came and knocked on the door with my newest book purchase...and here I am, wiping tears, sniffling, signing for another book while my two puppies are freaking because they can't quite see who's outside.Anywho, I would most DEFINITELY recommend this book to anyone who loves a steamy, real-life romance with real flaws, honest writing, and heart-catching characterization.**Special thank you to Cari for sending me this incredible book. It was a true pleasure to read.**"

Unfortunately, in her world, Princesses are meant to be rescued. The question is, would the princesses really want to be rescued if their rescuers are the princes in this story?It's actually almost ok. I just don't want to put two stars because I do not `not like' the story. It was a very new take on a rescued princess but the story just lacked the benefit of a longer story to actually engage me to like the story.I think at first the rescued princess' world and observation is funny. However it never changed in the end so it became too old to be funny. Some events are just too absurd for me to be funny like the activities of the Prince to name one.Three star because the Princess actually decided and actually acted on that plan, to rescue her own self. Good for her! A quick read."

Many doctors don't even know current information available on celiac or gluten intolerance. And what is available is incomplete - the jury is still out on many important questions, like whether gluten intolerance can be an early 'phase' of celiac, and how little gluten it takes to cause further complications like cancer or diabetes.The gluten-free diet is a huge life change that requires major emotional and physical adjustments. A gluten-free diet means no wheat, barley, or rye in any form, and in many cases, no oats, either. Because gluten is hidden in so many products, it can be extremely difficult to avoid. If you've just been diagnosed with celiac disease and you feel overwhelmed, no one can blame you. But don't despair. Lots of individuals, organizations, and resources are available to help you learn to do well and thrive.The only way to relieve the symptoms of celiac disease--and protect the intestinal lining against further damage--is to avoid all foods that contain gluten. Once the irritating gluten protein is removed from the diet, the intestinal lining can start to heal in 3 to 6 days, although full improvement may take up to 6 months.These tips are helpful but to receive complete and comprehensive information, ONLY this Ebook ""Gluten Free And Celiac Disease... Want To Learn How To Cope With Celiac Disease?"" will give you the needed knowledge to help you ---buy it highly recommended!"
"08 17, 2011",B005HMGY0G,5.0,"All the Wolf, None of the Wait!",AFLHSS3286LLV,"This compilation contains the types of novels where, when the phone rings, or the conductor announces your stop (or you miss your stop), or you suddenly remember that the kids need to eat and the dog has to go out, and you just can't ignore that anymore, setting a story down brings a sort of culture shock. It's like stepping back into the real world from this seemingly intense visit to another one, seductive, thrilling, and filled with beautiful, stunning scenery - and sexy, stunning werewolves, witches and warlocks. The author, Heather Killough-Walden, accomplishes this over and over, story after story, which is why I have read everything she has written. She creates worlds and fills them with  her own forms of magic, her own vocabulary and the rules and intricacies to keep a reader at ease in them. One thing her novels never are is predictable. She is a storyteller in the grandest tradition, and above all that is what you will always get with one of her books - a great story.The BBW series begins in Baton Rouge, Louisiana with ""The Heat."" Lily St. Claire has just returned to town with a degree in social work and while she has been away her school girl crush, the upper classman, black-haired, blue eyed, all around heartthrob Daniel Kane, has worked his way up the police force to become police chief of Baton Rouge. Kane is a werewolf, who rides a Harley Night Train, has the body you would expect of the alpha wolf he is, and the southern charm, ""eh cher?"" to leave this reader breathless. Lily has been dreaming about him since high school, dreams in which he turns into a wolf, the signal that she is his dormant, his intended, once-in-a-lifetime mate. Lily doesn't know that's what this means, and it isn't until her return that Daniel finds out, just as he and his Baton Rouge police force, mainly composed of the wolves of his pack, are faced with a series of horrible, high profile crimes. Daniel senses another wolf is after Lily, one who might even be the murderer striking the city and he feels forced as the alpha he is to mark and make her his own - he just never gets around to asking Lily. But life gets even more complicated in Baton Rouge, and the bond between Daniel and Lily is severely tested.Onto Vegas. In the second book in the series, ""The Strip,"" we meet many of characters from ""The Heat"" again in lesser roles, except one character takes on a starring role - the best-selling author, Malcolm Cole. Cole is a very strong alpha wolf who has been struggling under a terrible gypsy's curse and is so horribly lonely that he is almost solely focused on finding his dormant. There is a real poignancy to Cole, even as he engages in some barely forgivable behavior. That is something else about Killough-Walden's writing: her characters have emotional lives that in the best moments hit you hard. ""The Strip"" is the story of Malcolm Cole and his dormant, Claire (Charlie) St. James, a drummer in a rock band. Cole recognizes her as his dormant fairly quickly, and Charlie has her dreams of a green-eyed man who changes into a wolf. But given the scarcity of dormants, it is not a surprise that there is another wolf set on Charlie, and where Cole can be ruthless, this wolf tends towards the sadistic. I don't want to reveal his name as that might be a spoiler, but I find nothing redeemable about him. He is just nasty and he loves his nastiness and he calls in magic users to make him even nastier. Of course, this makes him a great villain. Cole can't save Charlie alone, but fortunately the rest of the wolf community is there to help.The third book, The Spell, takes place mostly in Trinidad, California and has left me with a huge desire to visit the area and see the redwood forests amidst the fog, and the ocean. The author brings the lesser elements of magic from the earlier novels to the forefront here. Dannai, a witch with rare healing abilities, has been dreaming of two wolves, one of whom is Lucas Caige, an alpha who has been traveling on his own for many years trying to find the killer of his older brother. He finally decides to settle down for awhile in this beautiful ocean town. But his older brother was killed by black magic, and therefore he is known to hate magic. Dannai knows him well from her dreams and immediately recognizes him when she comes across him. Upon seeing him she desperately attempts to keep her magic shielded so he will give her a chance. But w-a-a-ay too much goes on with her coven and the werewolf community for a witch of her gifts to remain shielded for long. Once again, the characters from the earlier books are part of the story, even more so in this one. But this is mainly the story of Dannai and Lucas.Finally, the fourth book is ""The Hunt"" and it tells the story of Byron and Kat, an alpha wolf held captive by magic and chains for fifty years by a spoiled vampire princess. He is unwittingly rescued by the very Hunter who has spent her life trying to find him and seek revenge for the killing of her father. At the same time she has been having a dormant's dreams of a handsome man who turns into a handsome black wolf, but she has to ultimately be convinced of her destiny. Katherine Dare is the most emotionally realized of all Killough-Walden's dormants, in my opinion. Her motivations, her memories, her unresolved sense of loss, are revealed so effectively, as is her mindset in general. Byron also has his own demons to deal with, as well as learning about the world in the 21st Century. Much of the story involves the relationship between these two as they wind up on the run together. Byron has black hair, stormy gray eyes, and the physique of an alpha. Kat is a natural beauty with white-blonde hair, indigo eyes and with the athletic build of a Hunter. But as all of the BBW stories are, this story is heavy on action as the characters we now know so well from the other stories join in to fight their biggest battle yet. One their entire race ultimately depends upon.If this seems like a lot, I have barely scratched the surface. Remember, these are four separate novels, with four very different stories and with a cast of characters that comes together as it grows. One caveat, these are ultimately wolves. Mating habits can get rough, and anything less wouldn't make much sense. Both male and female characters have an otherworldly sexual drive at times. Watch a documentary on wolves and you will see the combination of tenderness and rough play. This is a great compilation as so many reviewers have attested to. Just clear as much of your calendar as you can to read it because you won't want to stop once you've started."
"06 6, 2014",B005I6B2JE,4.0,Couldn't put the book down.,AIUQPXHNWL7HE,"I had the physical book, and of course, I can't find it. The first story, that takes place in Lancaster, PA, was somewhat heartbreaking. It's such a shame that someone can be on death-row for basically, the rest of their natural life. The death penalty either needs to be abolished, or put the person in prison for life with no chance of parole. It's awful what victims go through.The second story shows that the young Hispanic girl had to have a part in the young mother's killing. Thus story seemed very vague to me.The last story, was of a father taking out a child's life because of his economic situation. A life insurance policy of $50,000, on a 2 year-old? That's so ludicrous. He should get the death penalty. It's such a tragedy."

I really enjoyed her writing style and it was so easy to read. There was a bit of slap and tickle in the story...literally.  The characters were so funny and by far the best lines in the story... ""I didn't do it.  It wasn't me"" followed by the word ""bubbies"".I enjoy reading about this time period which as around 1081.  The story mentioned it was 15 years past the battle of Hastings which was in 1066.  William the Conqueror won this battle when King Harold died from an arrow piercing his eye.  That's the legend anyway.  It's funny that I remembered this information from my history classes when I was reading this book."

Ms. Maitland takes a premise that could've been written as stroke fiction and gives instead, a great romance.The dialogue and interaction between characters is crisp. I was sucked into slice of life she created. The author knows how to create emotional tension. I went along for the ride and could'nt stop turning the pages.For the most part the secondary characters were very real to me. I wanted to know them & hope they get their own HEA. I only had a problem with one character that I felt was a bit over the top.The love scenes- OMG HOT! I think I needed to smoke after one of them ;) Crescendo has earned a spot in my menage top 5."

"09 5, 2012",B005LILSPW,3.0,Was I blind?,A1RRMF5XW5NZDD,"I have just read some of the other reviews for this novel and concede maybe I missed something.  I found it fascinating with two very fascinating characters, and certainly I feel it is important to understand how the past affects our lives but the plot is thin.  Poppet is a good writer so there is some glue keeping this together but I found it hard to connect with her characters, and not because of the subject matter.  Cutting, unprotected sex is part of the self destruction process and I feel for people who hurt so much they need to hurt even more, and to be perfectly honest I feel we can all relate to this in some way.  However the main protagonists do not get sympathy from me, I don't find them likeable enough, and I don't like that she has the affair and then the very neat ending so for me the best I can do is a 3 star rating."

"12 27, 2011",B005OC5QXK,2.0,Disappointing,A1M0EWJIRQL8ZH,"I was hopeful when I started this book, but it quickly grew into disappointment and ended the same way. The ending was abrupt somehow. Tom's character didn't make much sense to me, he came across as very pathetic in many ways. He could be strong minded with his family and confident on the farm, but his level of clumsiness and faux pas with women was very unbelievable alongside it. He was only outdone by the very pathetic Peter who made me want to holler at him for having his mother manipulate him the way she did. The book moved fast, the heroine and her Tom seemed to move into a relationship that only exemplified infatuation not a real friendship as a foundation for their decision to get married. And it ended as abruptly. But good thing. I would have hated to feel that I'd wasted even more time reading this than I did."

A lot of these type of stories have an unbelievable amount of acceptance by all the friends, family and Co-workers that I just find them too good to be true. This was a very realistic view of how I imagine big, tough, sexy cowboys who are gay would struggle with the outside forces in their lives. The scenery was beautiful, the secondary characters were awesome, and the sexual tension between Travis and Ray was so hot, it was just amazing.A very well written story, I could not put it down.

I woke the next morning and bought every available episode and spent the entire day reading.  Problem for me is that when I am fortunate enough to find a book this suspenseful, food, sleep and family go by the wayside.  The authors have done a great job with the storyline (NEVER revealing too much) and with the characters (who may not always be what they seem. Every chapter adds to the mystery, leaving the reader wanting more.I discovered my post-apocalyptic addiction many years ago with the book Swan Song followed by The Stand with MANY not so memorable books in between!  I was a late bloomer to the TV series Jericho and The Walking Dead (which I was very reluctant about since I am not a zombie fan) and now I am counting down the days until October 2012.  This post-apocalyptic serial is every bit as captivating and suspenseful as the aforementiond books & series.My only negative comment concerns Dog Vader...never would have happened like that...no one ignores their dog's behavior change and puts him in a closet because the creepiest character says to do so!Anyway, best of luck to both authors for feeding my addiction and I will tell everyone I know with a kindle to at least try Episode 1...you might like it!"
"11 28, 2011",B005SJT2W0,4.0,Well-written and fast-paced story,A3LF914GG87TWP,"The Blue Island Clan trains its best warriors to be part of the clan leader's elite forces, called the Kifzo.  These elite warriors are trained from a young age, and when the time is right, the best of them compete to find out who will be warleader.  This short story focuses on that competition, as well as the more profound competition between the clan leader's sons, Kaz and Tobin, as they struggle to determine who will lead the army - the power-hungry and corrupt Kaz, or Tobin, whose sole interest is in the betterment of his Clan?The story is well written; the characters are defined quickly and surely, providing a uniqueness to each one without causing a hitch in the plot.  The plot moves smoothly and efficiently to the conclusion, providing a few answers, but more questions.  Personally I did not care for the story - I didn't like the culture being described, the ruthlessness, the viciousness and dishonorable intentions of the majority of the Kifzo, their power-hungry and crude - dare I say cruel? - behavior quite sickened me.  This should not count against your decision to pick up this story if you enjoy military fantasy stories, as I am quite sure this is just being realistic.  I don't care to read such things, as it just increases my belief in the general disgustingness of humanity, but those who aren't as misanthropic as I am will probably be entertained by the action and fast-paced plot.The first full-length novel in this series - which is ""Rise and Fall: Book One in the Blood and Tears Trilogy"" - will be available 12/1/11 in e-book and in paperback soon thereafter.  ""Warleader"" is a short story basically providing an introduction to the world and characters."

I thought it was going to be a little bit of a prince-meets-ordinary-girl-falls-in-love type of story, but I was totally mistaken. This story took a totally different turn, a dark turn.Violet is a young woman that seems to attract the wrong kind of men. Men who like to abuse her physically and mentally. Mick being one of those men. He treats her like crap, but for some reason, she keeps taking him back.Then she finds a neat little package on her front step. A regal looking package. An intriguing package. Possibly from a secret admirer? And what is inside the package is just as regal; a beautiful ruby necklace.She knows it couldn't be from Mick, so who's it from? She can't figure it out, but at the moment, she doesn't care. She just wants to wear the necklace.But something happens when she puts on the necklace. Something that starts concerning Violet, and yet, makes Violet feel that she should take back some of the abuse that has been bestowed upon her.This is a very dark short story. It won't take you long to read, but it leaves you thinking that you'd want to get that necklace off as soon as possible. Will she take off the necklace? Can she take off the necklace? And, what about Mick? Will he fear her as she had feared him? You'll have to read the story to find out.5 stars!"

It is great when I read about a warrior who was a female. Of hatred in a grand vizier to keep love apart. A scheme to prevent the pharaohs and his wife to have no children. Another scheme to invoke Set and bring a horde of jinn down on Egypt. This author has done a fabulous job on characters and the plot."

He does her surgery and after he stays the night and takes care of her, the hospital is short staffed because of a winter storm. They spent time talking and falling in love. I enjoyed reading about them and seeing how they overcame their struggles. Not every story has to be the &#34;typical&#34; male role."

"12 2, 2011",B0060M0QU6,5.0,Really Good but much too Short,A3S7REHVBOSTLR,"A great story but much too short! It's unusual for a tale to have so little interplay with minor ones for most of the narrative, but this one does--and it works, with only the three main characters interacting with each other. The descriptions of all three are revealing, especially the detailing of bodiless entities, of the lives of creatures existing as light and dark and on a different plane from our own.  Since most of the action takes place on a mental level, there's not all that much dialogue but that doesn't detract from the tale a bit. I was caught up in hoping something would save Tannis from the inevitable death by assassin, and wondering if Kadin was as villainous as she thought him. The entire story left me wanting to know more...about Kadin, about Tannis, of what happens to Nick, and Zoril, a who orchestrated the whole thing.Like the title, Will o' the Wisp is just the wisp of what appears to be to be an ever longer one just waiting to be told. There's enough hints in this story for a full-length novel.  So I'm wondering if there's any chance the author may enlarge upon it at a later date, or perhaps spin off a series. I'll look forward to that."

"12 26, 2011",B00640YZ1U,5.0,Another great story from Lara Adrian!,A3TCEX54TCIEES,"Lara Adrian is able to pack a whole lotta story in a novella and believe me, that is not an easy task. I'll be honest, I'm normally not the biggest fan of novellas or short stories, it usually feels as if things are packed in or as if important items are left out. That was definitely not the case with A Taste of Midnight. Lara was able to pack  so much information in the novella without me feeling bombarded with facts and items that were not needed. The story was exactly the perfect length.Dani's story was great and I loved being able to catch up with her and see how she was doing. I am so happy that she was able to get her HEA. I was very curious to see how her story would turn out and to see if her HEA would feel believable or not. With the way the way things were left with Dani I wasn't too sure on her HEA. For me, it isn't always believable when a widow/widower takes on a new love. It just feels like the love they had before wasn't real or the new love feels a bit forced or not completely true. That was definitely not the case with Dani and her HEA. I was on-board 100% and I totally believed in her and Mac.I really enjoyed getting to know Mac. His story broke my heart and I found myself rooting for him as soon as he came onto the page. I am so glad that he and Dani were able to find solace and companionship with each other.This was just another great story written by Lara Adrian and it just reaffirms my love for her and this wonderful series."

There are several people who will Follow you on Twitter and then when you Follow them back they will drop you. I know this because I learned how to know when someone drops you on Twitter from this book. I notice there is a trend of people doing this  who have thousands of followers but only follow a few.

"05 2, 2014",B0066778L0,4.0,Good,A1QJ17BR5K3C8K,"This was a very good story for the first book in the series. Christina Thomas is expecting a long lonely weekend with a blizzard in the forecast. While out getting supplies, and decides that this storm is the perfect opportunity to try a few items from the adult bookstore and see if they can keep her nice and warm. What Christina didn't plan on running into anyone that she knows and she certainly didn't plan on running into Cade McMartin. Cade who has secretly been in love with Christina since they were in second grade waits until she leaves to see what caught her eye and forms a plan. Carter Montgomery has a problem he suddenly finds himself very attracted to Cade, his life-long best friend, law partner, and roommate and he doesn't know what to do about it. He&#8217;s convinced it&#8217;s time to find a place of his own, and put a little space between them so they can both get on with having normal lives. Carter fears the worst when Cade comes home unexpectedly and realizes the boner Carter&#8217;s hiding is all for him. Instead of starting a fight, Cade sweeps his best friend along into a crazy plan to spend the winter storm making everyone&#8217;s hottest fantasies come true. What I liked about this story was that each one of them realized that they have feelings for the other and didn't want to live without the other. The sex scenes where very hot and Cade who is the dominant of the three thought that he would make everyone's fantasies come true. Carter and Cade both think that the other wants Christina to himself so when Cade over hears Christina and Carter tell each other that they love one another he tries to leave when the get a break in the storm only to almost die because of a tree falling on his Hummer. What I liked about this story was that it got straight to the point. This is my first time reading this author and I am looking forward to reading the rest of this series."

If this is the first Secret book that you have picked up, I strongly urge you to start at the beginning of the series otherwise, you miss a lot of the background and may feel confused with some of the relationships.The story starts with Secret complaining of a numb butt - yep, off to a great start already - as she is sitting in on the Vampire Tribune.  Now that she is a member, she has to ""rule"" over the proceedings with the other two members.  Her greatest concern - is the vampire half of her becoming more dominant as she is actually starting to enjoy and act like a ""real"" tribunal member?She also becomes involved in a case as a ""favor"" from Holden's maker.  The Queen of the were-ocelots, Genevieve Renard, needs help - her niece Lucy has disappeared and she wants Secret to find her.  This turns into a case of not only one missing college girl but several from Columbia University and brings back an old flame, Gabriel, who is accused of murdering at least one of them.  When Gabriel gets his one phone call, who does he ring but Secret to help him out.  Probably not the smartest thing to do considering he broke her heart years ago when he left with just a note on the fridge when he moved out.There is the secondary plot line involving Lucas and the Pack.  Secret's Uncle has decided to make a play for some of Lucas' territories and Secret must step up and really accept the responsibilities of being Pack Enforcer and Lucas' bond mate - too bad no one has really explained what that means to her..We don't get to see as many of the characters from the other books - Holden, her vampire friend, past warden, now lower ranked bodyguard is a minor character but shows up to support Secret when she needs him the most.  I missed their interactions because it really is a fun relationship.  The Vampires are more background players in this book.  On the plus side, we do get to visit with Calliope at least a few times.Secret continues to grow with her new powers and tries to make sense of her roles in both the Vampire world and the Were World and is stumbling into all sorts of messes with both.  What is nice though is that she is also growing as an individual and you see more of that in her conversations with Desmond and in her opening up to others around her.  Don't worry though, she is still the sarcastic, snarky Secret that we all know and love.The ending was great until the last paragraph and then I just wanted to scream - urgh!!  Major cliff hanger!!!  And how long until the next book comes out???  I do know I will be anxiously waiting for it... I don't preorder many books but the next one will be first on my list.."
"01 25, 2012",B0066YFB0S,4.0,Spawn of Satan!,ADGLADSOHAQMJ,"Wow, I just finished this emotional roller-coaster and seriously, the characters in this story are MESSED UP!  This story is for the much older YA as it contains sensuality and extremely dysfunctional relationships. Molly Owens is a powerful writer who takes on the dark subject of abusive relationships and shows how tragic and dangerous they really are.The main character, 17 year old Chelsea, likes the bad boy Levi even though she knows he is going to rip her heart out and hurt her.  Levi hates his father who is evil, messes around on his mother and raped his daughter-in-law.  Foreshadowing along with his own actions make it look like Levi will not turn out much better. Loving someone and excusing their actions because they are good looking makes Chelsea pathetic for a good portion of this story.  It is not easy to read.Chelsea's best friend Hannah has moved away and left Chelsea lonely and unsure of herself.  It was Hannah's personality that gave Chelsea strength so when she meets the hot and commanding Levi, she is enamored.  Except that every time she is with him, she becomes wrapped up in a dangerous, life-threatening situation.  She has also started having nightmares.  Levi is dangerous but he makes her forget bad stuff and always accept his words and always believes he would never harm her.  Then she meets Conner who is the epitome of good and who loves her in a healthy way.  He tells her that ""being bad is easy.  The hard part is doing the right thing, the decent moral thing.""Chelsea gets trapped in Levi's hell and has to find a way to free herself.  This story reminded me of the feeling I got while readingFuryby Elizabeth Miles.  The story is so gripping and so frightening at the same time that you just can't ""look away"".Would I/Did I buy it?

I felt the connection between the two characters that I think was entirely the result of them being stranded. The thing that left me a little cold was that I don't feel like I knew anything about the hero. He seemed to be up to some shady business and that was kind of glossed over. Oceans was ok, but for someone who admittedly grew up in the midwest, she seemed like the chick from Blue Lagoon. After the crash, she all of a sudden became queen of island living. That didn't make much sense to me, but I was willing to suspend belief for a while."

She begins acting out and becomes self-destructive.  At a loss with how to help her, Lale's parents send her to spend time with Emre (Tarkan's twin) & Elle to help with the new baby.  Instead of helping, Emre makes it worse because it only continues to remind Lale how much she misses Tarkan - because even though Emre may look exactly like him, they are completely different.  Elle once again steps in and sends Lale to Vegas on a getaway, secretly setting her up with the 1 Night Stand dating service.I really enjoyed getting to know Lale and her date/love interest Andreas Michos, who is a former NFL star.  They clash from the start because she's Turkish and he's Greek.  When you add in that he is a Dom and she clearly doesn't see herself as a submissive - the sparks fly.  What he shows her is how to let go, turn her mind off and for a few minutes & give control to someone else.  I liked Lale & Andreas together, but I didn't connect with him like I thought I would.  I think that was simply due to the fact that this was a short story and I wanted more time to explore their dynamic together.  They did get their HEA which they deserved given what they'd each been through.  Great sweet & short read!"
"01 12, 2012",B006BC05R4,4.0,Very sweet,A1RXR105ND8OSH,"I am happily surprised. I was so disappointed with the second book of the series that I had almost given up on the series, but this last book was so much better.The plot revolves around Jin trying to master his nekhene power and his mate and friends facing all kinds of external dangers. I think in the first part this was especially Logan's book and in the second part it became the tribe's book. Jin seemed more a spectator or commentator than the protagonist, because he was totally overwhelmed by his own uncontrollable power and Logan's dominance. This gives a sort of coherence to the whole storyline that was lacking from the second book of the series, in my opinion. The writing was much better too and even if I am not really a fan of the author's style, it was pretty focused in this installment.The love between Jin and Logan is the real value of this book, it's an exclusive love that is maybe unbearable seen from the outside, but it makes perfect sense for the rules created in that world and for the concept of fated mates told by the author. There's a lot of tenderness and sometimes I like to lose myself in these illusions. Sometimes it was as if Jin was too helpless, but Logan's regard and respect made their relationship more balanced.As I said before, the secondary characters are very important in the book and it was interesting to see how their stories played out. There are all kinds of possible spin-offs for the series.Even if sometimes the narration wasn't very smooth, especially because of all the rules in the panthers' world, and sometimes I had the impression we were still wandering about, it's impossible to put the book down.Galley received via Netgalley, courtesy of the publisher."

Maybe add a little bit of Vampire Academy too. Then bam! You get this. It manages to be original mostly while having elements most people in the urban fantasy genre should be familiar with.The writing is a little clunky in some places, but overall very readable. Its a great amateur effort.The author does give a thanks for the cover art... Which is a little funny. I think with a better these books would have much better sales. So hoaky looking.The book follows the adventures of a newly minted magus ie mage who just got introduced to the world of magic and vampires and must figure it out. First in a school magi and then in a real battle that is going on around them. Its a little played out at this point. And its very hard to believe a character that was as nerdy as this one would not quickly catch up with something like a history of magic...All that being said, I really enjoyed it.

Each character is carefully and skillfully woven and there is a sense of place that is truly rare to find in a historical novel.As a reader, I would find it hard to believe that one could come away from reading Ms. Carey&#8217;s books without being deeply touched and wanting more.This is not just another series it is one that will continue to touch your soul long after the book has ended."

I really would have loved to know more about Ed, but I imagine I will have to continue reading the series, which I am sure I will do, to find out about him.Dan was a wonderful man (why can't he be real?) and Jess was a sympathetic woman who went through some very tough moments.

However, I was frankly bored through the first half of the book.  I was almost half way through before I knew enough about Cruz to care about him.  It was even a little more than half way through before I was really interested at all in the assassin.  There is great potential here, but it fell a little flat.  This is not a thriller.  There just isn't enough life threatening action in it to classify, in my mind, as a true thriller.  And the big assassination plot ended up falling pretty flat for me.  Perhaps this is really meant to setup the following books.  If so, the reader has to be really invested to read through this book with the intent to read the others.  And the others would have to be significantly better than this one.  But how would you know that without taking the time to read them, with the potential to be disappointed?  A dilemma!

This was a ghost story like no other I was so engrossed in the story that I found myself staying up late to finish it.This was not a normal ghost story this was a paranormal entity story.I have always been one of those people who do not truly believe in ghosts, but at the same time I have always believed that when you bring old things into your house there is a chance something could be attached to it.We follow in first person what is going on with Syria and the ghost she has let into her house. But this isn't a normal ghost this is a sexual hungry ghost. Who will stop at nothing to make sure he continues his sexual rampage towards Syria. Syria of course has no clue what is truly going on for a while and she hides it all too well from her husband which I found quite weird. Because I am wondering why her husband is not more questioning as to what exactly is going on? Why the more sudden not leave my side behavior that she is showing.The only problems I had with the story is *POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT*1.) Her daughters play a big part in her life but they are never fully developed within the story. I hope that makes sense.2.) When all this first started, why didn't she start researching what was happening? I know if something weird was going on within my house and I wanted answers but didn't want to talk with anyone I would have so been looking online or in a library for answers.3.) Jeff's father leaves Syria the hat but why would he do that? This was never explored or answered. Why not give it to someone else? Or keep it? I believe this could have been explained.If you like a good ghost story, with a lot of sexual things going on well then I highly suggest you pick this up. I was glad I got to read this book. Now reading the blurb I noticed it said inspired by a true story, I am intrigued as to know is this experience something this author went through? Or maybe a friend? Either way really good story minus the little problems I had."

A few paragraphs reveals the family's past and future. It is brief, but it is complete. It takes place in a holiday setting, but it is a good read any time of the year.Short stories are hard to say much about without giving much away, so I will just add some quickly gathered info from various sites to give a potential reader some background to the life and times of Arthur and his family.Medieval farmers earned just enough to survive, this combined with the 12 hours per day an average farmer had to work, made for very difficult lives.Farms were never property of the peasants; they were property of the lord and he would exchange farming land for taxes he received in return. Farms were small and the peasants who worked the land did not own the land they worked on. This belonged to the lord of the manor. In this sense, peasants were simply tenants who worked a strip of land or maybe several strips. Hence why farming was called strip farming in Medieval times.Serfs were heavily taxed and were required to relinquish much of what they harvested. They did not even ""belong to"" themselves, according to medieval law.They had provide free labor, food and service whenever it was demanded. They had no rights. They were not allowed to leave the Manor and had to ask their Lord's permission before they could marry.The land which belonged to the lord was sometimes located all in one place and was called the close. On some manors the land was scattered in strips among the peasant's strips. One of the duties owed by peasants was to work a certain number of days on the lord's land and to give him the crops from it. They also had to pay fees to the lord out of their own property, for example, a percentage of their grain harvest or a number of chickens or young pigs. For every benefit the peasant had, he had obligations to the lord. Usually a third of the land was reserved for the lord's use and the peasant was required to work about three days a week on it. From the work on their own land, they were expected to share the crops with the lord as well. The lord would also share in fish caught on the manor. The lord benefited from his processing monopolies; some of the grain that was milled into flour, grapes crushed, beer brewed in his vats or bear baked in his ovens, became the property of the lord or a fee was paid for use of the equipment. A bailiff, appointed by the lord, supervised the peasants work on the manor. Peasants were expected to pay tithes equal to one tenth of their products to the church for its support. The lord often received a share of that according to his influence.As a final note I wish to add that this story may have had a special significance to me as I too gave the same gift to one of my three children."

Audry makes a welcome return she's so deviously bad I found myself cheering her on.With a nice satisfying ending with help from unexpected sources I hope Mrs Hamilton continues with these complex angels."
"01 10, 2013",B006MQ9WO6,2.0,Whimiscal,A2VPRAV2IL9NCQ,The story is a whimiscal story one expects from its Irish setting. It is a heartwarming tale of dealing with grieve. Gratefully it involves a Christmas miracle calling its characters to their better selves. It ends too abruptly and with too many unanswered questions and too many unresolved plots.
"08 28, 2012",B006O3MEZG,4.0,Devilishly good reading.,A3JN40J7GDAQ1P,"Loved reading this book!  The characters were fully fleshed out; the plot full of twists and turns, and held together well.  Nice mix of thriller, crime novel, paranormal romance, and paranormal suspense.  Looking forward to another book by this author."
"01 30, 2013",B006OJRKAE,4.0,Heartwarming,A3CNWB7180ELNL,"I enjoyed this book a lot.  I started reading it during the holidays.  Needless to say, I'm a little late finishing it.  Trying to sale a house and move has put a damper on my reading appetite.  The story centered around two main characters, Emma and Jake.  Emma's husband, a military man, loses his life in the line of duty.  Jake is the man that her late husband sends to watch and protect Emma as she deals with the grief of her husband's passing. I hate to add too much information.  I fear I will give the book away and add to many spoilers.  I will say that it's a great read and is especially grand during the holidays.  Emma finds her own savior and sexy Santa in Jake Nicklaus.  Who wouldn't love a sexy man in a red suit?It gives insight into the hardships and grief involved in losing someone in the service.  This hit home for me because I once had a close friend that lost her husband overseas.  We both had husbands serving at the time and my husband had just returned home from Iraq only weeks before I got an email from my friend saying she had received the news of her husband's death.  Talking with her and listening to her over the months to come, were heartwrenching on so many levels as she dealt with the grief of moving on without him.  Sadly, we lost touch over the years.  Distance sometimes will do that to friendships but before we lost touch, I was gratified in knowing she was once again doing well.  This book shows you the insides of those emotions and allows you to feel the rawness of them but it also shows that eventually a light will once again shine and life will move on. I discovered this book on a free promo day through Pixel of Ink and I'm glad I felt the pull to give it a try."

I recommend it for a relaxing day at the beach..."
"01 4, 2013",B006QCMCRK,3.0,one plus one,A1VN2TU8YZS5P6,"This is a spicy quick read for anyone that is looking for a fun escape. I read this book really quickly and all in one shot. It was more like a novella to me. I approach novellas and novels differently. When I am reading a shorter story, I am looking more for instant gratification and plot/action, and less on character development and nuances. This book delivers on that completely!Lacinda wins a trip on a singles cruise. I really liked Lacinda and I felt like I understood her more than I expected to. Kay Dee Royal does a good job of explaining the characters motivations and emotions. I liked how she was a little slow to open up, but then once she did, she gave herself over completely.As for secondary characters, I really liked Blade but his friend, that helped him plan everything, really got on my nerves. She just seemed to think that people were puppets. But that was really my only drawback with One Plus One. Other than her, I really enjoyed this book.One Plus One is like taking a vacation. It is a fantastical escape. it is not deep or extremely detailed, but it was a lot of fun and a good read.*disclaimer- I got a copy of this book for free in exchange for an honest review. I was not compensated for my review."
"02 20, 2013",B006RDFQEO,4.0,Sorilla Rocks,A3MCZM7LEPFROG,"This book has the elements of great space opera.  There is plenty of action, lots of battles.  The characters carry over well from the previous book.  I do like that it too is a self contained book in that you can read it alone and not feel like there was not a definite ending.  I like strong female heroines, and Sorilla Aida is that.  The technology in the book is great.  I would have given it five stars if it were longer.  I am already reading the next book, but again it is too short!  I really like 450 - 600 page NOVELS.  Alastair Reynolds is one writer who can pull that off."
"04 7, 2014",B006RNBI6O,5.0,Thread of hope.,A3NW92RPU6LS0L,Awesome. Loved every minute. Could not finish it fast enough.The characters were distinct and their lives well defined. Can't wait to read the next book in this series.

"06 7, 2013",B006W0PLYW,5.0,The Paw of the Lion,AVOFEVNTHVNPL,"What a pleasant way to teach a bible story.  The author brings the scenes to life with well-placed images.  Instead of having to imagine what a sling shot looks like, there is an image.  And who doesn't love pictures of animals?  Children will love the simplicity, pictures and details of the story.  I love the statement that this was a little boy with a big God."

This story almost reads like a James Bond novel with assignments for those fae involved in trying to keep the Dark Fae at bay. The story is very promising and I wish the author would have elaborated a bit more on the characters and the history behind the Lios&aacute;lfar. It was a smooth and interesting read. I am looking forward to the second part of the novella"
"02 2, 2013",B006XGU5L4,4.0,Crazy good,A35FMAMHVGYJ4Q,"This was a really nice surprise. The story line could have been a quick fluff piece but instead, you got to see a very deep friendship with three hilarious, well meaning guys. I enjoyed reading everyone's thoughts so that the major players showed a lot of depth. I agree with other reviewers that this could easily become a movie. Super fun, you won't be disappointed."
"05 28, 2012",B006XNEH7U,5.0,"Tense Action, Mighty Adventure",AAZW6X6EW3W4U,"TRADE WINDS TO MELUHHA by Vasant Dav&eacute; is a coming of age novel filled with action and adventure, a love story set in prehistoric times. It is a story not just of love and adventure, but also about murder and evil. It is about the abuse of society's weakest in order to further the ends of the wealthiest--and to be more specific would spoil the surprise at the end of the novel.The book is filled with characters that flee, fight, love, and narrowly escape death; and although their names may at first sound strange to our ears, we identify with them, largely because the author cares so much about them. He has created living, breathing, flesh and blood men and women who yearn for a better life. We walk with them on prehistoric ground recreated not just from the author's imagination, but from scholarly research.It is 2138 B.C., the Bronze Age, Sumeria (roughly, present-day Iraq). Samasin, the main character and stableboy to a wealthy Babylonian, is accused of murder. Taken into custody, he escapes a death sentence due to unique astronomical events which are actually recorded in clay tablets discovered in Babylon. He goes in search of Siwa Saqra, the name that the victim uttered before dying. He travels from Mesopotamia to Meluhha, thought by most scholars to be the ancient name for the Indus valley. During the voyage, he meets beauties, wrestles with pythons, saves damsels in distress, saves a pangolin from a cobra (one of my favorite scenes),and persists until he finds Siwa Saqra. He returns to Sumeria to initiate proceedings against the antagonist, where the reader learns the ugly truth behind the murder and the nature of the trafficking between Mesopotamia and Meluhha.I loved reading this book. Throughout I wondered whether Samasin would succeed. Does good triumph over evil? I recommend TRADE WINDS TO MELUHHA to all readers seeking a mighty adventure."
"05 22, 2013",B006Z1GKXO,4.0,Good story,AW7JJRAMYZY1X,I loved the intensity of these two people. I wish it wasn't a novella and was a longer story because it would have been interesting to maybe see where these 2 characters would go. But all around it was a good short story.
"06 24, 2012",B006ZR02PK,4.0,Captivating--Loved It,A12J54EK0MXZ5V,"It's very hard to put this piece into a category without diminishing it.  If you are interested in a story that can be enjoyed on several levels, this one is for you.  I loved it; it was captivating for me on many levels.  It's an interesting story; it's a great ""insight""; and it kept me thinking and ""dreaming"" long after I'd finished and set it aside.  This is definitely a story I'll go back and read again.  I recommend it if you want a story to do more than just entertain you; if you want it to also make you think.  Give it a try! Don't let its short length make you think it's short on inspiration!"
"11 3, 2013",B0070DZI70,3.0,Dragged on......,A18YT5P54A1Q88,I liked the story but the mid area of the book really dragged on. A bland ending as well after dragging it on that long.

I liked this book and ready to read the second book!!  This story had a beginning a middle and a end.  I am not one for horrible cliff hangers.  My only issue was with Cal.  I expected the son of Ares to be something other than the red headed step child.  But it is still a book I encourage yo to read."

"09 8, 2013",B00734OB42,2.0,"Emphasis on ""Young"" Adult",A5T0MVSHMKWMV,"There are some bright spots that kept me reading...I think the author has a fair talent for dialog, and the premise of a post-apoc world where humans actually are doing well, but are held to pre-tech levels due to warring gods was interesting.But the storyline was just too juvenile to hold my interest. I don't really use the word ""juvenile"" as a criticism here, as I think this story may very well appeal to 12-15yr olds. But as a 44yr old compulsive reader of all things scify and fantasy, I just couldn't get past the shallow plot devices used to advance the story.Also, the 15yr old protagonist is struggling with the realization that he's gay, is in love with his best friend's brother, and also seems required to choose a wife. This aspect really did not play well for me, in large part because the emotional turmoil and internal dialog surrounding this ""romance"" was too much. It would have been too much even if it were directed toward a heterosexual interest, but I have long practice skimming past this kind of stuff...the fact that it was homosexual made it harder to ignore. But that's just me, maybe others will like it better... not that there's anything wrong with that  :)"

It had a storyline, a lot of books don't especially werewolves and shifter stories. Yes, there is sex in the story, but still so what.For the price it wasn't bad as some say, otherwise; I wouldn't give it a 4, and I am very picky on what the author gets or deserves.Read it for yourself, if I believed every single critic I wouldn't be reading at all."

Set in Canada during the prison riots of the 1970s, author Karen Black&#8217;s historical romance has a gritty underside that will grab you and keep you reading well into the night. A cross between Grisham and Hart, this is a page-turner.The characters are well conceived and authentic. Naive Liza who spends more time with books than people and angry, disillusioned Dace are both outcasts in society&#8211;&#8211;it&#8217;s what draws them together. I ached for Liza when Dace was sent to prison and felt like I was living through the prison riot, which was written about the true-life Kingston Riot of 1971. This is a thrilling tale of incest, drugs and ex-cons. How can you go wrong?I really enjoyed this gritty historical romance/legal drama. I was caught from page one and couldn&#8217;t put the book down."

Rosemary meets Antonio and dreams of being with him all the time. Rosemarys parents think he's in with gangsters . They don't want Rosemary being around him. This is hard for Rosemary because she loves her parents dearly. Al Capone and Bus Moran are turning the city upside down.

You will be surprised. Marie spins a nice story. Thank you for sharing.

Clearly, the story is not true, although it is something that could possibly happen.  Baseball fans will enjoy a courtroom drama over an often contested issue in the sport.  Phillies fans in particular will enjoy this work.  You should know it is more about the legal side of the drama, and the prosecuting attorney specifically, than actually about baseball.  It was a good story."

The book had two main characters Ciara and Nick. The story followed their journey through freshman year. Ciara is a sweet but naive young girl who struggled to make the best of a bad relationship with her boyfriend. Nick is a confused and selfish young man trying to straddle the fence that separates his hometown life from his college life.I really liked Lakeshia Poole's concept of the book. But the execution of it left something to be desired. The book was written from two POVs. When writing a book with alternating POVs it's important to label them. At times, it felt like I was reading two different stories. To me,the sequence of events in the POVs were out of sync, at times. It was confusing and made me lose interest in the story. Lakeshia Poole is a fairly new author and wrote this while she was an undergrad. I'm curious to see what else she comes up with. I'd be open to reading another one of her books."

I found myself skipping pages that were filled with minutia that had little bearing on the story. This is a personal preference &#8230; I like the writing to be tight enough that those long, descriptive passages are unnecessary. The story is a good one.  The Choosing is a selection process whereby citizens of a certain age appear at a ceremony that determines in what roles they are to serve their kingdom. Those who possess magic and the power of healing are separated from those who will serve as soldiers and enter the knighthood. There is also a tender love story here that adds interest to the story of their travels._____________________________________________________________________________________"

Watching this couple fall in love, yet neither knew they were actually engaged to one another.

"11 17, 2013",B007CKQ2KS,5.0,Vampire Elite :),A64NGKLPWCG32,"Kristen Ashley is an exceptional writer. She is the Nora Roberts of her time. I can only recall one story, from  her that I have read, that wasn't good. After all, she is only human, but I am sure that regardless of the length of her stories, I am guaranteed a ride and a whole new world of characters to love.I, for one, don't mind change and with Lucien and Leah, that's all you get! Whether it be their history, present or future. These two are always pushing the envelope. Now, I know we are accustomed to the 20 year old virgin or outcast falling for the sexy decades old vamp, so let's give it up for the 40 year old, 20 year old who makes it fun to be forty!Leah is an unique character. Then again, this is the elite of the all vampire stories. This is old world charm, extravagance and even rules. I am not sure where this story is set, as places mentioned are only for relocation, as oppose to present. I suggest the US because of the police number, but then I can't be too sure either. Not that it matters, as this story is so good no one care about location.I think the structure and the story line is what makes this novel so awesome! I wouldn't mind never hearing the word &#34;concubine&#34; again, but I do love the meaning behind the terminology and the respect received and given by most, to the title of basically being &#34;the woman/man on the side&#34;.Not that the main characters were bad, because they were great! However, I found myself more intrigued with the rules, culture and eventually the prophecy of this series. I am not one for werewolf romances, I think my werewolf knowledge stops with the 'Twilight' series and the 'Underworld' movie franchises. With the interests and possibilities gained from this story, I am certain I will begin my werewolf reading, because you can't stop at one book! I'll secretly say the hybrid is what interest me most, but I don't mind taking the journey to get there.This was a well written story with intricate details, history, culture, beliefs. It's a whole new supernatural world. Don't discount it as another vampire story, as it is not and will surprise and enlighten you to another form of vamprism and other supernatural creatures.  It's nice when an author takes the initiative and time to create their own realm, and that and more is what we got.This a different world of vampires, who are almost human, if not for their advanced abilities and diet. While this is a romance story, it is far more. Lucien, Leah alone with their friends, family and acquaintances gives you your money's worth.I love all the characters in this novel. Their roles and personalities are clear and their purpose known. You have no questions, and if you do, they are answered by either Lucien's or Leah's POV. Sometimes both. There is much to learn, discover and anticipate with this novel and series. Even after almost 500 pages I still want more and feel like the real story is yet to come.I guarantee it's another splendid Kristen Ashley novel that will leave you wanting more. This lady knows how to write a novel and in extension a series. I hardly ever complete her series, but this is shaping up to be my first ;)"

"10 30, 2012",B007FEFDCE,4.0,"Very short, but fun for readers who are already fans",A32EOHLFZYXJEP,"If you've enjoyed the misadventures of impoverished royal (thirty fourth in-line to the throne) Lady Georgiana in the Her Royal Spyness series, you'll probably also enjoy this short story prequel. It provides background information that will be interesting to fans, including how Lady Georgiana met enigmatic love interest Darcy, but it's light on plot, characterization and suspense so if you haven't yet read anything else in the Her Royal Spyness series, this isn't the place to start. It's current price of almost three dollars is steep for not much more than twenty minutes of reading, but I needed something light and fun to distract me from Frankenstorm Sandy, and this was a perfect, if brief, solution.As the story opens it's the end of  Lady Georgiana's ""season"".  At great expense to her broke though affable brother Binky and his resentful wife Fig, Georgiana has been presented at court (she nearly crashed into Their Majesties because her heel caught in the train of her gown), and  she's attended numerous balls and society events, but so far she hasn't had any proposals. That may be about to change when two invitations arrive in the mail to set things in motion. As with the rest of the series, actual and fictional characters mingle on the page, and this story includes a fictional first meeting of Wallis Simpson and Georgiana's cousin David, the future if short reigning King Edward VIII."

"11 19, 2012",B007FSBUCM,5.0,"Very short, very good!",A1OLGW6LUM9M5U,"Very short, yet very good.  After reading Kaufman for the first time via his second novel, I did not think twice about buying his other two works.  This short story alone justified my purchase.  With the opening sentence, one can only guess where the story was going. The surprising and tragic end elicited such shock; it tore at me!All of ten pages, with the events playing out in five different locations, and a real good plot; add to this that I gave him four stars for his second novel...well, long or short, Andrew Kaufman is a great storyteller."
"04 2, 2012",B007FTN8GW,5.0,Wonderful Book,A1SYMBNYSKZEW9,I thought the first book was good but this one blew it out of the water.

Every once in awhile i will grab a book and read it to get my imagination going again. Douglas E. Richards has a great book out called ""Ethan Pritcher Body Switcher"". This book is designed for 7-8 years old but its great for all ages. Think about it. When you were back in sixth grade wouldn't you have loved to been able to switch bodies with anyone. I know i would have. Richards has a great gasp of how young kids act. Another great thing he did with this book was bringing the relationship of brother and sister together.It's a very easy read and should be on everyone's reading list for this year. After you finish have your children read it.This is easily a four star read. Great Job Richards."

He knew most of the words and thoroughly enjoyed the pictures.

His first book was out there=well not at his hometown library.He finds it hard to write, sleep and to concentrate as he's on the houseboat of his brothers and in total there are 3 of them there.Avery Newbridge was taking care of the Star Harbor Inn for her aunt who had recuperated from breast cancer treatments. She is hiding out, not sure what to do with her life now. Her sister Kate had told her she had heard noises and things moving at night and some food had gone missing but nothing to be concerned about.She tried to talk Theo out of staying at the inn but he took a room, indefinitely...  She is on a break from the drug rehab center and she's tried to help so many and some don't make it leaving her like she's failed.I first wanted to read this book because of the name Grayson. I got it mixed up with another ongoing series and thought this was the latest. It's the wrong Grayson, but I like the storyline anyways and now I am happy to say I gotta go get the rest of this Grayson series cuz it's that good!Love when I stumble onto a new author!After dinner at the local restaurant they go back to find an intruder had broken into the inn. After reporting and the police showed up the next day she's to get new locks and keys and find out everybody in town knows about everybody and that they know she has a violin case. The local ensemble practices Thursday nights and they've asked her to join them.It's a friendly kind of 'knowing everybody's business'.  Although the book mainly concentrates on Avery and Theo there are other relatives involved that come and go into their daily lives and another book is dedicated to them. I did not feel like I missed out or was left in the dark as some of their backgrounds are gone into to make you feel not so lost.She was trying to figure out what she wanted to do with her life as her social worker job was on hold and other things keep popping up, Theo and now the violin group...Theo's next book is starting out well with help from others who lent him books on the ship wreck nearby. He is just piecing the info together while having a drink at the Nail with other locals.They spend more time together decorating the inn for the Christmas holiday and each of them talk about their jobs...There are many stories of when the boys were younger and played pranks on others. some very detailed they had to have originated from Theo.She doesn't want to start anything she can't finish cuz she's told him he's leaving by feb 1 and so is she.The ice skating bonfire sounds so New Englandish I recall my younger days!Mysteries surrounding his writing and the Boston Harbor area...Avery gets a job offer and is contemplating staying near her relatives and not going back to her old job. Decisions, choices for the both of them...Drugs, hospitalizations, wedding, and Christmas all make this a very exciting action packed book with hot steamy sex to only add to this tale.  Love how everything was tied together at the end!Recipes at the end, super!"
"09 3, 2013",B007MPFUWE,4.0,Melanie Jackson is Great!,A2PBVEWGWZNMIL,"I have said this before but it is worth repeating.  Jackson really is a good author and writes about so many diverse characters that each story will keep you wondering about the next installment.  Even though I don't buy into the ""super natural"" belief I do think that this story is well written."
"09 6, 2012",B007N0M0DU,3.0,I just don't know....maybe 3 1/2 stars,A39W22LTN7AVY,"While I enjoyed most of the story, the typos were jarring.  There were sentences missing words in several places.  If I ignored that...There was no shortage of ""hotties"" described in the book.  All the men were described as gorgeous...and all of them just fall in love with her on sight.  The love scenes were all of 3 or 4 sentences long.  I think if they were removed all together, this would be a great YA book."

"05 21, 2012",B007OCHLAE,5.0,"A great story, when does the next one come out?",A1YVDKMJY8A76P,"I read this story just after finishing the 1st and 2nd Dragon Lords series (which still has 3 more to go), while this series has 2 more to go. I really love the way this author thinks and writes. How incredible would it be to sneak on board a space craft to help your bff's who were  captured. Then not only help them over the next 3 weeks but end up kicking alien butt and saving a bunch of really hot, sexy did I say hot yet? warrior types and end up on their planet where mayhem ensues since the guys, or should I say extremely dominant guys who are always right(yeah right) go up against 3 very strong willed herione earth women. Its quite amusing at times which I like. I was really bummed when I reached the end since I wanted it to go on and on. But at least I still had Tink's Neverland(Cosmos' Gateway Book 1) to read. Unfortunately, I've finished that now also so I'm really bummed. Any who, read this book, it's a hoot and a really great adventure to lose yourself in."
"07 2, 2013",B007OCHLAE,4.0,River's Run (Lords of Kassis:  Book 1),AT8UBQ1GJ5TX,"They were called women warriors  by their alien soon to be mates.  River, Jo and Star totally impressed the alien warriors with their skills using in using weapons and physical agility.  Neither species knowing much about the other seemingly love at first sight not understanding proper protocols  getting together was a little difficult.  It was light hearted book with some serious sex scenes and violence.  Liked storyline it was a little bit much with the bondage sex otherwise enjoyed reading."
"04 3, 2012",B007OGX910,5.0,Eye of the Beholder,A8A4LKHUV6QB0,"Despite the title ""Seducing the Doctor"" this book is PG 13. The ""seduction"" is more mental than physical as the protagonists wrestle with their attraction with each other. And the ""doctor"" ... Well, it's easy. Both lead characters are doctors. Ashlyn Richards is a renowned plastic surgeon while Reed Algood is a successful pediatrician.Poignant and sweet, the book is an easy read. Its not a page turner but it catches your attention to the point that once you started reading it and had to put it down for some reason, you want to go back to it ASAP.***MY TAKE ON THE STORY and SPOILER ALERT***Reed has a scar that mars his handsome face. Ashlyn wants to correct that disfigurement so bad, she would do anything. But unknown to Reed, Ashlyn has scars too though they cannot be seen. So, though they acknowledge their attraction to each other, both of them keep telling themselves that it won't work.Of course, this is a romance novel so a HEA is given. What makes this book stand out is the premise that it was built - beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. In an era where beauty is being worshipped, when going under a knife is considered normal and a girl in her 20s feel that she needs Botox, ""Seducing the Doctor"" touches on the more noble reasons on why plastic surgery exists. And the book also discusses the shallowness of the reasons why many opt for an elective surgery, thus giving the readers both sides of the coin.Not a philosophical book at any stretch of the imagination, ""Seducing the Doctor"" nevertheless makes you think."
"03 3, 2013",B007OPUIGU,5.0,Beautiful book...,A14NIB484K2FGY,"A werewolf who's life hasn't been that good meets a female with the supernatural ability to calm his wolf, not to mention be each other's perfect mate.This book does something that few books in this genre can do. It tells a happy story. In a world where books constantly like to up the ante and have their characters be the center of world shattering events, this book does the oposite. Basically, that means that there's very few things that actually go wrong for the characters. Now that might sound like a boring read but trust me, this is anything but. It lets you live in an almost perfect setting and has you enjoying yourself while you do it.You might think that writing a happy story is an easy thing, but you'd be wrong. It's hard to hold the attention of any reader when your characters have nothing to go against. That's not to say that there weren't any emotional hurdles that the characters had to face. There are those... There is also a bit of action/adventure towards the last half of the book. But these things take a backseat to the romance and sexy time that both leads have.This is, for all intents and purposes, escapist romantic writing, the kind that you curl up to in bed and enjoy. This is the kind of book that you can read and leave your troubles behind as you do. It makes you feel like there is such a thing a true love and that there is someone meant for everyone out there.That being said it did get a bit overly sweet for me somewhere down the road. But I have something of a sweet tooth, so i was able to stand it. In that respect, it isn't for everyone.One last thing. In regard to the sex in this book: There aren't any supernatural elements in it. The werewolf aspect only comes in as reassurance that the characters are perfect for each other. Basically, it's regular sex with the security that the ones having it are a sure thing because they're ""mates"".5 stars. If you are a voracious reader who feels tired of all the drama and dark broody characters, and need something to cleanse your palette, then this book is for you. If you want to have a good time and just enjoy a happy setting, this book is for you. If you like to indulge in sweet things and are looking for the the written equivalent of that, then this is the book for you."

"07 4, 2012",B007Q2DRFU,5.0,"""Three-Way Tie is one erotic way to spend a weekend...""",A320TMDV6KCFU,"Lindsey has been searching and exploring the world of BDSM in hopes of finding the satisfaction she has always craved. Yet to date, none of the Dom's she has worked with have been able to satisfy her. When the chance comes to win a weekend with a respected and renowned Dom, Master Rafael, Lindsey decides to bid on the experience and shockingly wins. And discovers she has won a weekend with not one but two experienced and well thought of Dom's. Just thinking of the weekend causes her to shiver and wonder.Masters Rafael and Eric are more than prepared to give Lindsey what she needs and wants but they have some very specific rules that she has to follow in order to play this weekend. Rafael never uses inexperienced subs and only agreed to this weekend if Eric would be there too. Just meeting Lindsey shakes up Rafael's view of what a sub should be. By the time the weekend ends, all three of them will have ties to each other that time, space and distance won't be able to bridge but will it be enough to show Lindsey and Rafael that they could have so much more?Two days, three people and a dungeon filled with floggers, whips and other toys pave the way to a lasting love. Three-Way Tie gives Lindsey and Rafael releases they never expected with some help from Eric. While I couldn't imagine doing as Lindsey did and bid for a weekend with unknown men, I could see that she was reaching for the ultimate satisfaction. I had to smile as both Rafael and Eric turned the tables on Lindsey and showed her that a real Dom doesn't let the Sub lead the way and how much more she would experience if she gave them the chance to show her. Their passion might have been fast, but it was a lasting one that I was glad Lindsey and Rafael gave a chance to with some help from Eric. Three-Way Tie is one erotic way to spend a weekend, so long as you don't mind a little playtime in a well-stocked dungeon and a lot of passion.Reviewed by JoFor Joyfully Reviewed"

This essay gave me an appreciation for the true grit that John Wayne had.  I had known he was plagued by cancer, but I had not known he had a lung and several ribs removed well before he filmed The Cowboys, and many other great movies.Morrell thoroughly researches a topic before writing any book so I knew that besides the engaging writing, it would be factually accurate.If you are a fan of westerns, or of good writing, read this book."

"06 23, 2013",B007UXDRMS,3.0,"Hot, action packed read",A5JZNVV4TEAWU,"Enjoyable!Nathaniel 'Nate' Bradley is a British agent with a mission. Find a stolen Faberge egg by any means and return home to England. On the way, he finds his mission changing to a more pleasurable yet more dangerous one. Dangerous for him mission-wise and dangerous for his heart.Tony Terranova, Jr is the son of one of the most notorious Mafia crime moguls and Bradley is tasked with seducing him to complete his mission. Bradley finds his Dominant side being put to good use when Tony turns out to be more than happy to submit to Bradley's dark tendencies.I enjoyed this book. It was a whirlwind of intrigue and excitement, cavorting from England to the U.S. Double and double-double agents abound, with a plot that twists and turns from one extreme to the next. I found I managed to follow it mostly, although I had to page back occasionally to check on something just to make it clear in my mind. That's probably more me than the book though.There was romance, heartache and plenty of sex. Lots of sex and BDSM play, and these two men scorched the pages with their passion. Tony is a really engaging ""villain"" and Bradley makes the perfect spy. The storyline was interesting as it flew along at a pace of action, sex, witty banter, more sex and more action.Lori Toland writes engaging dialogue with characters that are likeable and tug at your heartstrings.I'd definitely recommend this book to anyone wanting a hot, action packed read with plenty of quirky characters, two main heroes that make the pages burn and a fascinating glimpse into the world of international intrigue and deception.Reviewed by Susan Mac Nicolfor TheRomanceReviews.com"

For me, giving this 2 stars is being generous."
"06 18, 2012",B007VOMU2E,4.0,Taut and good fun,A1DTSET17K9R0Z,"I ripped through 'Steam Legion' in a couple of sittings, mainly because I like slash and burn novels set in Roman times, but more so because Currie writes neatly and engagingly, with a nice mix of action and introspection to balance the tone.This is an alternative history novel that contains sufficient historical context for us to visualise the main canvas, but deviates from what actually happened right across the board, though in a very intelligent way.The 'Steam Legion' of the title relates to the harnessing of steam power, which is not one of the Roman Empire's innovations noted by Reg in 'Life of Brian' and therefore one I concluded is of dubious historical accuracy.  No matter, the way it is used, and by a woman no less, is the pivot point of the plot as a numerically inferior Roman force battle a numerically superior Jewish force.Currie has fun with people and places, and creates strong characters - both male and female - and then incrementally loads up the action and tension page after page.Give 'Steam Legion' a try if you likeConn Iggulden'snovels or David Gemmell'sDrenai Tales."

Ever read something that was 'almost' there had the author put more thought, editing and plotting into the story?  This is one such effort.  It is too quick, the story too underdeveloped, too rote and the writing too rudimentary.  A little more time and perhaps a better well of critique partners/editors and the author may just salvage it.  But as it stands I did not enjoy the story or the underdeveloped premise."

This book is wonderful! Damien and Christo go from boardroom enemies to bedroom lovers. Watching the entire thing transform before your very eyes is entertaining and joyful. Both men are as stubborn. Both want the same thing. I want to hide Damien away for my very own and never return him. LOL! This is a beautiful story and I loved every part of it.
"06 9, 2014",B007Z3QVGW,2.0,"Far Horizons, Book 1",A35PKGX7BM9DI,I ordered the novel thinking that it would contain interesting adventures in the New World for the characters.  I was disappointed to find that this book was really a hackneyed plot of a tragic love story and quit reading it about 1/4 way through the book.
"05 9, 2012",B007Z3SP8E,5.0,Had me squirming,A16AHVO5B3NOP5,"Gifune is definitely a master. I found myself squirming and uncomfortable throughout this story as the sense of unease grew stronger and more concrete. A testament to the concept that, contrary to Shakespeare, the evil that men do does live beyond the interment of their bones in the form of scars and even ghosts that haunt the living. In fact, evil never truly dies.5 stars. As others have said, if you are not reading Gifune, you should be."
"09 29, 2012",B007ZXKE4C,5.0,Very short for a fun and hot read!,A27IDJFUMQT9IE,"After a fun read ofPhone Sex: Erotic Fetishes and Sexual Fantasiesby Sandra Ross, I went looking for other erotica titles that could be fun reads, too, and I came across this book, A Duet of Regency Sex Comedies by L.C. Zingera, among others. I hastened to read this book because it is highly recommended, and I wasn't disappointed. I like Nothing Less Than a Duke better, although The Mischievous Virgin was indeed mischievous and I liked it, too. Since they are very short, talking about the content could be very spoiler-filled, so I'd rather say that you will love how L.C. Zingera was able to mix comedy with eroticism, which is really surprisingly well, since you will not find much of comedy mixed with erotica often. Or at least, meshed well as in this book were. I love the characters, Duke Rightwood is endearing and thumbs up to Cubby. Loved their HEA. Loved how Dare got his hands really full with his naughty virgin wife. Highly recommended. You will surely love this, too. Only complain is they're very short! But that's often a complain with really good stories, you never want them to end!"

"01 2, 2013",B0080HU6KY,3.0,"Fast read, faster romance",A2SBNIQK0K5XDD,"It was a fun read, pretty predictable, but the setting was a nice change of pace.  There was an awful lot crammed into a very short space of time, so if you want to read about lust at first sight which develops into ""true love"" quicker than is believable this is a book for you.The conflicts were pretty predictable and easily resolved, and the character development was weak.  Considering the emphasis put on the Chocolate Oscars I would have enjoyed reading more about how Annie got involved, maybe her training or something.  I don't recall reading anything about her ""day job"" while she developed her chocolates.  As it was, other than the story of her being jilted at the alter and how she felt about the matchmaker gig, there was nothing about her that was really developed.There were some editing/formatting errors in the later half of the book but not among the worst I have seen."

On the positive side I found A Passing Curse to generally enjoyable and I was a bit caught up in the mystery element surrounding the character Ajax. I liked having the author tease us with little glimpses or suggestions about the nature of the Ajax without giving an actual definition of whom or what he is. I also thought that some of the death scenes were creative. Also a positive mark for me was the use of other supernatural elements based in a specific Native American tribal culture; giving the story a very uniquely American twist. On the negative side, I felt that the two main characters were hard to relate to in that Rusty was unrealistically intrepid for a woman with a scholar&#8217;s background. Her male counterpart Reese, seemed to jump to conclusions too quickly for someone who spent years as a homicide detective. Lastly, I found it difficult to assume that even in a small town where money rules that so many homicides and other incidents would have been that easy to seep under the rug."

We&#8217;ve come to know her for her approachable style and wild imagination, but this is oh, so much more.  She mingles suspense with sexual tension in a manner seldom seen.  Her vivid descriptions put you firmly in the realm inhabited by her captivating characters.  I was also floored at the way that she works real world issues into this unforgettable futuristic tale.Atwood creates the type of characters that you instinctively connect with and want to see succeed without having to know them very well. I fell in love with Lexy the moment she wanted to prove herself, even though she had nothing to prove.  I also enjoyed the fact that the cast wasn&#8217;t entirely human.  Both futuristic beings and mythical ones join their human counterparts to create an immensely enjoyable whole.As a whole, this novella was fun, exciting, and out of this world, both literally and figuratively.  I wouldn&#8217;t hesitate to recommend this to anyone & can&#8217;t wait to read the 3rd novella in the trilogy.Please note that I received a complimentary copy of this work in exchange for an honest review."

Like maybe there could have been more fleshed out, without it being dragged out.I will be reading more of this author, in fact I just bought two more!"

I love a good mystery and I love dog stories, so this book was a very enjoyable read. I was kept in suspense until the end of the book trying to decide ""who dunnit"". I had several suspects in mind, but I was surprised when the real suspect was finally revealed and arrested. There were several villains in the story and the author made those characters very unlovable. I felt sorry for the original suspect since I knew early on that she was not capable of committing murder. I was worried about the dog's safety at the picnic area and I was relieved when he was okay. I would highly recommend this book to readers who appreciate a good dog tale along with an intriguing mystery."

She never expected it to go down like it did. Now stuck in the safe room with nowhere to go, her and Sid must take care on their younger siblings. Things turn bad to worse when they are low on food and someone tries to get in. Will Diamond and Sid pack up the kids and run or will they stay down in the safe room until it's too late.My only complaint about this book was it was entirely tooooo short. I NEED more!!!!!! I was soo into it by the end and then it just ended. The author sure knows hoe to make you want more. Also I think she should end up with Sid. I mean come on he is any girls dream....well my dreams LOL I can't resist a guy that is tall and has dark hair...YUM I really hope the guy that she thinks she likes he a nice guy if not I will jump into the book and do something not very nice :D OK on the other matters. Why in the world was going on with her brother. I think there is a mystery evolving around him and I want to find out.Diamond: I think she was pretty good for a main character; she did what needed to be done and did it. She held her emotions in for the sake of others as well. I think me and her would make fast friends.Sid: You already know how I feel about him *meow*Kelvin: Didn't really find out too mush about him, but I could tell he was a very sweet kid.Mica: Is very mature for her age. She is only five but has so much sense about her. She does get whinny at one point but who wouldn't if you hadn't eaten in three days.So I will continue with this series b/c it has caught me in its claws. I can't wait to read The Core.

I've quoted Sun Tzu often enough, especially in the old Quote meme I used to host, but felt weird having never read the book.Amazon had it free and that was my golden opportunity to read it and see exactly what I had been missing.Philosophy.Aren't most philosophical statements just common sense told in parable? That's how I see them, and that was especially true in this book. Most of the points or statements Sun Tzu made, I felt were common sense if you just sat and thought about it.I took time after each point/statement and thought hard about what it meant. Sometimes you didn't have to think hard at all, it was plain as day. Each one rang true, and each one was different from the last.Look, I know we are not a world where every country is at war. But this book isn't just about fighting a war on land, it also touches on the wars we have within ourselves.Sadly, I don't think everyone will 'get' this book. Nor will everyone enjoying reading it, but I did."
"10 2, 2012",B00851M856,5.0,loved it... after a reluctant start...,A1BR87KW2JFPH,"After a few pages I stopped reading and jumped to another of Le Veque's books. I just thought the grandmother was such a conniving, mean, manipulative witch and Gray's daughter was a spoiled brat to continue on, so it wasn't because of bad writing or anything like that. Le Veque's wonderful storytelling abilities and character description has a way of pulling you in and making you feel. I was just so reluctant to read on and see how these two people would hurt Gray.After reading three of Le Veque's other books, I decided to go back to The Falls of Erith (it was my last medieval book from Le Veque). I am glad that I continued reading (even though it was a week after starting) because it was a great story. I loved Braxton and Gray was such a wonderfully strong character. Plot, as usual, was interesting and the characters were great. Le Veque's books are a treat to read... yes, there is always a ""happily ever after"" ending... but it's the journey to reach this HEA ending, predicaments H/h find themselves in, that keeps you interested. (well, there is also the love and passion between the H/h).So for me... loved it... another book of Le Veque recommended."

It gets explained in the book and as you look back at it and go ahhh, you start to see the beauty in the simplicity. Actually, that's the case for the whole book.  If you are looking for action-packed sequences or studded leather collars, this isn't the book for you.  It's rather an everyday tale with divine interventionCara's life (or lack of it) consists of a normal everyday routine.  Same thing, every day, with no exceptions or surprises.  Until her twin sister dies.  Then Cara's life is turned upside down.  It took her sister dying for Cara to finally reach out and want to live.  The life that she had up until that point was not living. She needed change, so when her job offered her a position in the Seattle branch for a special project, Cara jumped at the offer.  She needed to leave the gloom behind her and decide if her marriage was fixable.As she settles more and more into her new life, she begins to realize all of the things that were wrong in her life in Baltimore.  She is also having dreams about a man.  A beautiful man who talks to her, shares things with her, and makes love to her almost every night.  He helped her more with her grief over her sister's death then any living person could.  But he isn't real...or is he?This was a sweet romance, almost reminiscent of Sleepless in Seattle, which I really adored.  You go back and forth between Jay and Cara's point of view and follow them through their everyday lives. It seems that fate has a special plan for the two of them and they have sent messengers to assure them that everything goes as planned.  Would that we all had guardian angels such as these!!  The world would be a happier place.  It was a delightful read!!*This book was provided for me free of charge in return for my honest opinion by either the author, publisher, or tour consultant*"

"09 5, 2012",B008705ORE,5.0,Very flexible for my schedule,A3U8AOZQ5PKY40,I bought the 1 Day Diet by this author before the 12 hour Diet. I actually asked her if there was a diet you could do for half the day and what to you know she came back with the 12 hour Diet! The 12 hour Diet is a little easier on the mind knowing you can have dinner is a big deal. I have noticed though that you need to follow her recommendations on what to eat for dinner. The good part is if you slip up you can do the 1 day Diet or just continuing with the 12 hour diet and you will be back to normal. I really like this diet and cannot believe I didn't think of this.

A part in the beginning gives some tips on tasty fish preparation, and the recipe, from a fish lover's point of view, sound delicious.

So much time was spent going over, and over, and over Lily's former abusive relationship with her husband. The first hundred times it was detailed I was sympathetic, but the author completely lost sight of the fact that this book is supposed to be a romance, not a treatise on caring for someone after trauma.I skipped over so much of the book trying to avoid all the repetition that I lost interest in the supposed storyline.Too bad, because I really enjoyed every other book in this series, and have re- read them over and over.

It was the first time Chlorophyll was found anywhere outside of Earth. The planet presumably had life but there was no indication of a technologically advanced civilization, at least no artificially produced radio signals.As the ""Highway to Heaven"" closed in to investigate, an alien spacecraft appeared and attacked the human ship. Earthlings retreated but they were presented with a dilemma: what to do next.The novel explores several interesting ideas. For example: Is the war between space-faring civilizations possible? Are there humanoid aliens out there? If we were to find aliens, what kind of creatures would be located closest to Earth? How would humans conduct the ""first contact"" with aliens that appear to be aggressive? What type of society humans (or any other species) would require to colonize space?This book, ""War and Space"" (War and Space Trilogy), is a Sci-Fi novel in the traditions of the Science Fiction circa 1960s-70s. It was then the more contemplative, philosophical Sci-Fi tradition was firmly established.Without giving any spoilers, allow me to hint that the humans and not the only sentient species living on Earth in the book's timeline. There is some adventure in this novel, and some humor. Special kudos to the writer for bringing up the matter of Space Cows and Space Cowboys and exploring their views on the matter of a potentially hostile alien contact."
"01 9, 2013",B008C80X8Q,3.0,3.5 Star Review,A3326UC548HDXO,"Bayou Heat by Donna Kauffman was a very good novel. I liked it and I would recommend it but don't go into it expecting any surprises.We first meet our heroine, Dr. Erin McClure. She's arrived in Louisiana to further her research. She thinks that she can take the plants and herbs that are used in Voodoo rituals and make practical medicines that could conceivably help millions of people. I think I liked Erin just fine. She is a great heroine. She's gutsy and she knows herself. She's also got that really cool mix of confidence and vulnerability. Erin, having grown up traveling the globe as her father did his research, is full of drive and determination. You know that she can take care of herself and, even better, SHE knows it too!! But there ARE a couple of things she knows she cannot do. One of those things is navigating her way through the secretive world of Voodoo. In order to get the information she needs, Erin knows she must have a guide who can take her into the Bayou and introduce her to the secretive religion and to the high priestess in the area. Lucky for her, this is where our hero comes in!Teague Comeaux is a seriously sexy bad boy! Certainly not Erin's type, if she has one. But Erin needs a guide and Teague is the perfect man for the job. Not only has he grown up in the Bayou, but his grandmother is the high priestess!! The only problem is that Erin first ""meets"" Teague as he's passed out, naked, in her bathtub! Of course, that's not REALLY a problem, right? LOL! Anyways, Teague isn't thrilled with acting as Erin's guide but Teague's brother, Marshall, asked him to do it as a favor and Teague is trying to have a better relationship with Marshall. Once he gets to know Erin better, Teague realizes that Marshall has unwittingly done Teague the favor! I felt that Teague was really sexy and absolutely embodied what I imagine when I think about a sultry Louisiana bad boy!Erin and Teague are so hot together and its not because of the Louisiana humidity! Their chemistry practically jumps off the page. I think that they both have their hands full with each other! Unfortunately, it was a lot of buildup and not a lot of delivery. The way that the author described Teague made me think he had some kind of a troubled background but that was never really confirmed. At least, if it was, I never caught it. I mean, he had a rough childhood because his mom died while he was a young boy and he's never really gotten along with his half brother but it felt like it was going to be something worse... like, he was in jail at some point or was in on a botched robbery that went bad and someone died... that kind of thing. But nope. And we never really find out the specifics on the illegal activity going on in the Bayou.You may expect this to feel like one of those southern gothic styled romances due to the Voodoo aspect of the book but it doesn't deliver on that either. Combing Voodoo, the Bayou and a man with a troubled past sounds like it would make for a secretive, mysterious, make-your-skin-crawl-type of story but I don't think you'll be feeling a lot of all of that. Of course, I wouldn't know how to write something that would make people feel unnerved but I'm not convinced that the author does either.After I've said all of that, you may be wondering why I also said that it was a very good book. Well, the simple fact is that I enjoyed it! : ) I obviously have my complaints but all of the good stuff was there: it was well written, had a little bit of mystery (even if you CAN see who the bad guy was from the beginning), had some humor and most importantly had great characters that you wanted to see again. So, I would recommend this book as long as you know what to expect and what NOT to expect when reading this one.Reviewed at HarlequinJunkie.com"

"11 30, 2012",B008DVUOS6,5.0,One of Our Favorite Bedtime Stories for the Kindle Fire,AB1S6Y1VMJPJ1,"I don't understand the negative reviews. My daughter and I love this book. It's cute, silly, and very nicely illustrated. It's about a young child saying goodnight to all his toys, ""friends"" he calls them. The rhyming bits are silly and that's what we like about it. It says, ""Good night, Dog."" And the next page says, ""Dream with a frog!"" It's really much better than most attempts at rhyming I've seen out of children's books lately where the author tries, and often fails at, rhyming every line of text throughout the book. We got this book when it went free. I collect a lot of books that way and many of the children's books aren't very good but we really enjoy this one. We've read it many times. My daughter is three."

I just wanted something light and fun, and I found this short story written by Kathryn Le Veque titled PURGATORY.I liked that the story took place in Louisiana where myths and legends are part of their folklore. I also found it refreshing because the characters were in their 40's. I devoured this fast paced romance of Elliot and Nash and their children. I recommend this book if you love a spooky and light story."

Now I've got to learn to check to make sure that the series is actually complete before I begin to read it.  The third and final book in this Trilogy was supposed to be out October 2012--it is now May 2013, and apparently it still hasn't been released.Which is a shame, because I really like this story.  This installment further developed the complex relationship between the mortal female Amara and the handsome hunk Deity Summit.  It also touched on an additional romance between Trent (Lucifer's son) and Nala, who is now mortal and in disguise.I do have to point out that the editing and typos were even more distracting in this second book.  Hopefully the delay in releasing the final book is due to attempts to obtain a competent editor.  I sincerely hope that there will be a third book, as I'd be very disappointed if I couldn't find out what happens to all the intriguing characters that I've come to enjoy.Again, like Book One, 3-3/4 Stars.  Good, but had issues."

As she meets each of her neighbors she is instantly drawn to them and her body takes over and her mind can't say no. She knows she shouldn't be jumping into bed with each of them, but there is just something about them that she wants to explore. Farrell becomes the talk of the town not only because she's a new girl, but she caught the attention of three of the hottest guys in town.

"10 12, 2013",B008OJ8D9O,4.0,Sexy,AJ89GTIRDYIS1,"I really enjoyed this book a lot. It was a great amount of romance without all the smut. Yes, there are sex scenes, but they are brief and not graphic at all. I wish there was more to the story about Beverly and Dandelion. The conflict is great and the storyline is easy to follow.I don't feel compelled to read the next book, because it appears to be only about the Faeling children of two of the characters. That is a little disappointing as I would like to see more with the two main characters."

Has a lot about a young woman's rise and fall in the world, and could be true (given varying circumstances) about any young woman. Add in a couple of leaps of fantasy, and this is a very entertaining story."
"09 11, 2012",B008PVQ0AK,4.0,A New Adult Title Worth Reading.,AWKDTHEV8HF5T,"I've enjoyed the first two books in Vernon's My Alien Romance series, so I was more than eager to read My Paper Heart when it was released in August, especially after I learned it was a New Adult title.My Paper Heart is about Libby Gentry, a college student that flunked out. As punishment, her parents send her to Elsbury, Louisiana to work for her great-aunt, but Elsbury ends up being the exact thing needs. Libby spent her time in college trying to please everyone - to fit in - but it isn't until she moves to Elsbury, and starts a romance with the local ""playboy"", Blaine Crabtree, that Libby begins to come into her own person.Libby's character did drive me nuts sometimes, but given her self-esteem issues, her behavior was understandable. I'm actually kind of glad that Vernon wrote Libby the way that she did. Libby's self-esteem issues are something that readers will be able to relate to. It's easy to lose yourself to the idea of who you are supposed to be rather than the person that you really are, and I think Vernon showcases that rather well with Libby. You can see the difference in her attitude from the beginning of the story to the end of the story. She becomes the young woman that she was always meant to be once she stops caring what everyone else thinks, and starts focusing on her own happiness.I've got to say, I thoroughly enjoyed this one. There is humor, romance, and self-discovery. It's a good NA title that readers will devour. And now that Vernon has confirmed there will be a sequel, I can't wait for more Libby and Blaine (mainly Blaine, not even going to lie)."
"09 2, 2012",B008QNVDEK,4.0,Love Kinection,A3F7WS4OJ6WN3H,"have never read anything by Jennifer James before, but I'm now a fan of her writing! She knows how to pull the reader in with her sensuously stunning descriptions of what the lead female, the sarcastic, neurotic and beautiful Abby, is feeling including how she describes her emotions about love (garbage:) and you can even  feel her anxiousness when the uber-hot techie geek, Tom, moves in for a sexy, sinful, mouth-watering kiss. This is a short novella and I don't want to give away any spoilers but let's just say that this book is definitely a must-read and Ms. James style of writing is addicting & sexy as hell. Pick this novella up & check her out!"
"09 18, 2012",B008R5185G,4.0,The Viking's Witch,A2G09684ZOK8X2,"Odaria is a Pictish witch, the last in her family's line of witches. Egged on by Brennan, the village leader, the village has come together to burn Odaria at the stake. Prior to the fire being lit, Odaria sets a curse on the village and it takes effect immediately in the form of Viking raiders. Rothgar, the Viking king's nephew, is on a mission to find Orvind, his cousin. Rothgar rescues Odaria and they feel a profound connection between them, but the path to potential happiness is long and rocky. Rothgar uses Odaria's magic and the fear of the villagers to try to ferret out the truth about what happened to Orvind and his men.I absolutely loved the setting and the characters. I found myself swept away by Ms. Wilkins' detailed descriptions into the past. Odaria is a sexy and saucy witch, yet very innocent in many ways while Rothgar is a hardened Viking with a heart. I loved the setting and some of the supporting characters as well, such as Nordskag and the other berserkrs. The sex scenes are very steamy and I loved the tension and drama in `The Viking's Witch'. Ms. Wilkins has written a fun escapist romantic fantasy novel."
"12 2, 2012",B008RX4K2G,2.0,Another passable story ruined by poor writing and lack of real talent,A3MRQ00YKS758J,"I can't believe how some are rating this so highly, and even comparing it to those masters - Asimov & Heinlein whose works I know well. I have no issue with reviewers who say they enjoyed a book - I actually enjoyed the story well enough to want to finish it.  I nearly didn't get there.  The writing is amateurish to say the least.  The author keeps using trite and hoary old sayings like they are new found literary devices e.g. &#34;jack of all trades, master of none&#34;.  the same thing can be said in a number of creative ways yet this sort of &#34;gem&#34; abounds.  As others have noted, word choice is often plain awful.  Good advice to any budding author is to read a lot and learn to distinguish good writing from the hack stuff.  By a &#34;lot&#34; I mean several thousand books in a genre written over several decades of the genre's popularity.  Learn how English is put together well and creatively.  Sentence structure is often laborious, descriptions and background social/political commentary and explanation are often repeated, some three to four times.  Are we readers not capable of remembering or understanding the first time?  A strong adjective is often repeated in the same or the next sentence.  This is just lazy.  A little creativity is required.  The author uses hyphens to break sentences up by putting an explanatory sentence between hyphens in the middle of the first sentence. This device makes the story logic awkward and disrupts the flow. A lot of the issues would be fixed by good editing.  Finally, the author patently does not have the necessary philosophical or socio-political depth of thinking and understanding to write the chapter prefaces (presented as  from a banned book written by an exiled university professor) in a credible or convincing way.  They come across as bits and pieces of thinking from someone out of their depth or gleanings borrowed from elsewhere.  There is nothing original or compelling about them and they are certainly not a decent reprise of any good analysis of why empires fail and how military elites become the last bastions of decency, honour and incorruptibility - which is how they are positioned.  Finally, it is not an original story in essence.  Perhaps there are very few originals any more but this one adds little to the &#34;corrupt empire falling apart with a beleaguered military elite doing good in remote places against overwhelming odds&#34; genre. it could have got away with being a rollicking good yarn, a bit like some of the better pulp westerns,  if only the author was up to it.  Sadly not."
"08 9, 2012",B008RX4K2G,4.0,Needs an edit,A1O544GH89TNYW,"The book needs a good edit; there are a lot of wrong words used, as well as one place where the pronouns change a she into a he. Also, one character goes from 10 years of service to 18 years of service in about five paragraphs. There is also a seeming disconnect between the number of Marines and the size of units; 81 effectives does not translate into 7 platoons. Auxiliary troops (pilots, etc) appear as needed without being accounted for. The back story and universe history is well developed and provides depth to the locale and behavior of the characters.That said, it's a fairly well executed futuristic military tale. I would say that there are no real surprises, other than that there are two groups of bad characters, and a more realistic social dynamic than usual. The characters don't really change or develop. The tale does end while leaving some room for further works.I got it while it was free; and it is a good read, a cu above a lot of the free stuff out there. A good clean up would serve it well. I've read commercially published books that were worse."

"04 12, 2013",B008SMSW1G,1.0,The Billionaires Boy's Club,A33H6XFIU5WLCQ,This short (very short) story feels more like an excerpt from an actual book. The end left you hanging wondering what decision Bree had made.There was no explanation about the club or it's purpose and the sex scene was lack luster with no built-up. The character development was non existent as you could expect from such a short story but Bree seemed to have become an entirely different person in a very short period of time.Very disappointing and not worth another read.

"11 1, 2012",B008TSWYNQ,4.0,Very Well written,A1WYWEXW1M995V,"I chose to read this book without reading the other two due to a busy schedule, and since I was assured it was a stand alone book I didn't worry about trying to fit the first two of the series in.It was, I admit, a slow starter for me. It didn't really pick up to the point that I found myself gripping the kindle as I devoured the pages, until the last probably half of the book, and by that time I found myself hooked.I loved the way it was written, the description fit beautifully with each setting. I also enjoyed that being a part of the Sci Fi/ Fantasy setting's there can be major hit or misses and N.H. nailed it all within this book.The only down side of the book was how much seemed packed into the story, I found myself having to re-read sections to make sure I got everything and I still felt like I had missed parts. It is definitely going to be a re-read once I have time to get the other two read so I am more invested in the series.I love how down to earth Grace was however, you really fall in love with the characters N.H. invests so much time in."

"12 1, 2012",B0090MXTVG,4.0,Reviewed for Cocktails and Books,A3TGY3ANGBNK7C,"Reading Owlet was an experience like none other.  The world that the author has created is so unique that it draws you in from the very start.  Intricate details unfold a beautiful story.  Each and every one of the characters is very well developed and their lives are so interesting that you're intrigued by every word and move they make.The main character in this book, Iris, is complex.  She suffers from horrible asthma, a delicate form of amnesia that keeps her past a secret, and a reoccurring dream of an island paradise that she insists is real and she deems her ""Never-Never Land.""  When her father surprises her and takes her to the very island she dreams about, her entire life changes as the mystery surrounding her past and who she truly is slowly starts to unravel.  As she discovers the truth, her vulnerability touches you and makes her a relatable and likeable character.The secondary characters, her father and the Peter Pan-esque boy from her dream, Falcon, add even more depth to the story.  Her father is mysteriously vague about every question Iris asks him about her past.  There are several moments during the story where the actions of her father bring out either extreme compassion, or seething anger.  Falcon, on the other hand, is incredibly hard not to love.  He is tenacious and caring, and insists on keeping Iris safe, with him on the island.  His character by its very nature is poetic.I typically tend to steer clear of YA books.  They all follow an achingly similar plot, give or take a few tweaks here or there, and it becomes redundant.  However, I was pleasantly surprised at how DIFFERENT from other YA books this story actually was.  Folkloric and lyrical in nature, this incredibly talented and prolific author has penned a wonderful story with a world that readers, like myself, will be delighted to get lost in.Review copy provided by Tribute Books for an honest review."
"08 24, 2012",B0090R2WV4,3.0,The Girl In The Shoe Store,A3EHVBAX1LCPQH,"Isabelle is watching life pass her by outside the windows of the shoe store that she works in. This isn't the life she expected for herself; she's a college graduate, she's attractive and yet she's alone and miserable. Mitch is a successful photographer who's noticed the sad woman who works at the shoe store. He decides to approach her and never expected to like her as much as he does. The girl in the shoe store throws caution to the wind and embraces what she has with Mitch and the feeling of being alive.The cover is really hot, and I guess it led me to expect a little more from this than what I got. That's not to say that this isn't a nice story, it is; it's just not what I expected. This is a sweet type of relationship, not an intense, hot affair. The sex scenes are nice, the characters are nice, the story line is nice... and basically it's just NICE. There wasn't anything really striking or memorable about this.::::::::::::Spoiler-ish::::::::::::My complaint with this would be the ""love"" deal; they barely know each other, and the story didn't have enough depth for love declarations to feel realistic. It's okay to end a story where the characters have only been together once or twice without dropping the L bomb, it's not a requirement."

There are  twists, and turns, secrets and lies...it's just plain good! ! ! I started it and didn't put it down until I had finished it. I would recommend this book, it's really a great read."

In Roar and Liv, and Under the Never Sky story by Veronica Rossi, we get the sense that life isn't easy for anyone... especially those whose lives can be traded.Roar loves Liv. She is his life. Now that his grandmother is gone, Liv and her brother Perry are the only family he has, and he would do anything to protect them. But their brother, Vale, is the Blood Lord of the tribe, and when he decides the tribe's well-being is more important than what his sister wants, Roar will do anything to prevent her from being sent away. But how much will he risk? His life? Her life? The lives of everyone in the tribe?This was a really interesting prequel because you really get an idea of how Perry came to see the world as he does. He knows the duty his brother carries on his shoulder, but he also knows what is right and wrong. It was quite an illuminating little story as you think about Under the Never Sky. How could you not be bitter and cynical when your brother has to sell his sister to feed his tribe? Especially knowing how life in the dome is!"
"02 3, 2013",B0090XKIN2,4.0,Typical Miller Style...,A1TU2M5RY0ETS,"I'm used to Ms. Miller's writing style by now. Outside of her typos and grammatical errors, I find that I still truly enjoy her work. She writes fullfilling stories about love with characters that are very believable. I read one of the other reviews and they stated that they could not get past the fact that the first half of the book the herione hated the hero. Then did a 180 when she realized she loved him. It's usually like that when love and hate are simply two sides of the same coin. Both emotions a very powerful and the onset of either can be rather intense. Both couples were a delight to get to know. I just wish it was some form of closeure for Demelza and Lady Allegra's brother. An epilogue would have been just ripe for it. Overall, still an enjoyable read."
"09 19, 2012",B00925VCF6,5.0,Mimi has found her Niche,A25DP9FAY7V8PA,"Mimi Barbour has  written numerous enjoyable paranormal novellas and short stories, but with Roll the Dice, her first Romantic Suspense, she has definetly found her niche. This story about two cops who are head strong, have their own agendas, and are determined to avoid a relationship--other than being partners--until they reach their goals will keep you turning the pages non-stop. Roll the Dice is fast-paced, written well with all the characters strong, and a plot that holds intrigue throughout the last word. I found I couldn't put this down and stayed up till wee hours reading. And I can't wait for the follow-up that will be a continuation of this one. Kudos to Ms. Barbour. This is her best so far. A must read."

This book has everything...action, drama, suspense, comedy, and scorching hot scenes! Loved it! Love SK! I'd read anything she writes and highly recommend it to any and everyone!"
"08 5, 2013",B0092QBP8Y,4.0,Radiant,A380JFP02KLOU,"My Thoughts: I liked Radiant. I wasn't expecting there to be an eBook between Hallowed and Boundless but when I found out there was one, I knew I had to read it before Boundless. And I'm glad it did, because it made things make much more sense!We are back with Clara, and she is spending the summer abroad with Angela. They are staying with some of Angela's family and this is exactly what Clara needs, some time away from everything.Radiant focuses alot on Angela's thoughts and her romance with a guy named Phen. I wasn't so sure about him at first and since he is in Boundless I'm glad I picked up this little novella.Basically, in Radiant we find out more about Angela's secret boyfriend, and how he comes about in Boundless. We also see things from Angela's point of view.I liked this story but not as much as the full length books.Overall: Liked it and enjoyed reading it, and think it is a good read in between novels. It sets the story-line for Angela better for Boundless and makes understanding it a lot easier.Cover: It's ok but not as cool as the other covers.What I'd Give It: 4/5 Cupcakes___________Taken From Princess Bookie"

How tempting would it be to use such powers for ill? And how quickly would the authorities try to appropriate such skills for themselves once they appeared?Susan Kay Quinn's novella, The Handler, doesn't answer all the questions, but it lets the reader see through a different pair of eyes, think from a different background and history, and enter a different world. With beautiful writing, vivid imagination, fast action and pleasing relationships, these short stories build a world where much can happen, and leave the reader satisfied even though much is yet to be told.Disclosure: The author gave me free ecopies of these stories when I expressed an interest in them."

So, it was with a degree of reluctance that I agreed to appease my girlfriend&#8217;s request to &#34;open my mind&#34; to the possibilities.She claimed that her friend (whom I generously referred to as, &#8220;Your crackpot friend&#8221;) had taught her how to see auras. She wanted me to try it&#8212; I declined. She insisted&#8212; I declined again. She reminded me who is boss with an endearing pout&#8212; I agreed. However, before I invested any time with the &#34;crackpot friend&#34;, I wanted to learn a little about what I was in for. This is the book I found.I began to read but, before my arrogant pessimism could fully kick in, the author made a bold claim right out of the starting gate:&#8220;Anyone with vision out of both eyes can begin seeing the radiating energy aura surrounding every person, usually within just 5-10 minutes of training&#8230;&#8221;Okay, I thought. Prove it!I eagerly flipped ahead to Chapter 10, &#34;Retraining Your Eye Rods and Cones&#8221; to Exercise 7 which asked me to begin by focusing on a pencil. I went through the next few exercises and it seemed that the net result of my effort would be a pair of crossed eyes. But then, a funny thing happened.Our dog, Flearoy, walked in my office and, as the book suggests, I attempted to look &#34;through&#34; my beloved pooch. To my utter amazement, I thought I saw a yellowish haze emanating from Flearoy as he prepared to lick himself in a place I shall not name. At first, I thought it was my imagination but, doggone it, there it was! My mind ferried between the shock of &#34;seeing&#34; an aura for the first time, and the disgust of being keenly aware of the actions of a canine tongue that frequently licked my face.In all seriousness, I was genuinely impressed with a book that I was fully prepared not to like. The author writes in a clear and conversational manner that is easy to understand. The layout and formatting of the e book version is very professional and the photos and diagrams are top-notch quality.I haven&#8217;t had my session with the crackpot friend yet, but I&#8217;m really glad I gave this book a chance. Maybe there&#8217;s something to this &#34;aura&#34; business after all!"
"01 20, 2013",B0096A5K9Q,3.0,Good read,A60EOH7P5VJ94,I definitely agree with all the other reviewers.  It's definitely worth more than $.99.  Also agree with the formatting and speech.  Other than that a good read.

I will continue to read the series out of curiosity, but not desperation, which stinks.  I tend to really look forward to series and I hate when I feel like I need to read them just, so I can see what happened versus wanting to read them, so I know how the story has developed and will end."
"10 27, 2013",B0096CG1FQ,4.0,Worthy of the Billionaires Attention,A33NBMS9OZ6X2N,Starts out slow but picks up steam very quickly the characters are made to feel real and you know this can and does happen in real life.  It is just what it says it is a short story but worth the read.  Sunni
"03 20, 2014",B0096CH78G,5.0,The Billionaire Playboy,AM1U6SVHYNML6,"this is my first time reading this author and I enjoyed it and am looking forward to reading the rest of this series.  I loved the characters,especially Charlie.  She was very reluctant about entering into a relationship but was able to look past an early abandonment to let herself fall in love.  I also respected her dedication to her profession and hard work in a time of crisis in her hometown."
"01 10, 2014",B0096QY6SG,5.0,Take a Swim With the Whale Whisperers!,A2LRV6NXPU3OZA,"This is book two in the Whale Whisperers Saga and I am totally in love with this series! I did a review of the first book a while back. You can read it here: [...]What I love about Drury's books the most is the writing is not forced. I can tell the author loves this series and the characters. I often wonder if he based them on people he knows in real life. The story is magical. I love the imagery and descriptions. If I could move to the Cove, I'd have my bag packed in a second! I also admire the way Ed Drury is able to include different realms and difficult sci-fi concoctions and make them believable - no easy feat! I'm not a huge science-fiction fan, but Drury is slowly changing my mind about this genre.There are many aspects of this book (and the previous one in the series) that will appeal to all readers. It's one of those precious gems that has a little something for everyone: action, adventure, love, morals, education, good guys, bad guys, hate, and greed. I know I'm leaving something out, so grab a copy and read it for yourself. Every person will get something different from this story.I am happy to report that from the ending of the book, I can tell there will be a third! YAY! Mr. Drury, I do hope you're busy writing! I miss my friends already and can't wait to hear more from them again.**Also reviewed under Nicole Storey."
"11 22, 2013",B0096TKHAO,4.0,Loved it,A6FT8XVP4T0YE,Main characters were well developed and likeable.  Story was engaging.  Sasha was the wounded hero with a good heart.  Rose was mysterious and enchanting.  Was an enjoyable read.
"05 11, 2013",B0098TUBTE,4.0,One Lucky Family,A2GCEOF7KVQK1U,"This book is the first in the Lucky Little Labrador series. Lucky is the smallest in a litter of eight pups. The others are always bossing him around. One day a little boy and his family come into the pet store. The boy falls in love with him and dad cannot refuse. He says that the pup is very Lucky. The name sticks. But Lucky and the little boy are always getting into trouble because of Lucky's curiosity. One day he and the boy fall into a mud hole. They are constantly getting punished. But one day when Lucky sneaks into the kitchen at night to steal a snack, he finds someone there. The family decides that they are really lucky! This book is advertised as a chapter book for ages 6-9. The pictures are adorable, but many of the sentences are long and complex. I think that it is more suitable for the higher end of that range. This book will be popular with children who like books about dogs."
"03 22, 2013",B00997VFHM,4.0,Great Read!!!,A1POT8PV2SC9J4,A truly gripping story.  I had a hard time putting it down when other matters demanded my attention.  I highly recommend this book.

"01 2, 2013",B009ALAPR8,3.0,Lots of information,ARHYU0IMJFOS5,"I gave this book 3 stars because it doesn't tell you how to use the mixes, other than a store bought packet is 1/4 cup. That said we can do the math & adjust according to the sizes or batches we are making. I found many recipes I plan to use. I'm sure this will be a good money saver as spices bought in bulk are much cheaper than prepackaged."

"07 27, 2013",B009DW4YMG,3.0,Jessica has it right,A4ZBGQS1QNYWI,"Dear Author,Some of us are literate and are bothered by sloppy writing. I found things like ""for all intensive purposes"" instead of ""for all intents and purposes"" annoying (among other similar errors). As it is used over and over I have to assume you either don't know the difference or don't care.I do like the story and hate being taken out of it by bonehead errors. On the plus side it is an interesting story line and mostly well written. I just cannot, for the life of me, understand how someone can take so much time to write something and then not check for obvious errors that can undermine the entire thing."
"09 29, 2012",B009EC25F8,5.0,Good book,A3HP7TFYARZXFL,I recieved a review copy from librarything & I enjoyed it. It kept me reading until the end. Wish it was a little longer though.

Great characters, well written, with the exception of a few errors but that may be due to it being an ebook? and funny. If this was a tv series, which it should be, I would be an avid fan!"

You feel like your right in the thick of the jungle with Nick, Ish and Marie as they look for the lost temple of gold.

"03 4, 2014",B009JD4LMW,5.0,Cute but short,A35AXJL9TQN3BO,I read the free first book and it hooked me into the 5 book plus this novella series.  Has some romance but is mostly paranormal mystery stuff.  Very good reading!
"01 19, 2013",B009JGYOQM,4.0,Interesting -- but it I thought it started too abruptly,A11GG3W3BWP5IT,"My reading interests vary wildly.I like a little bit of everything.Still, in the grand scheme of things, my favorite genre is paranormal mysteries.I feel comfortable in the world - and I like characters that are a little out there.I don't know what I was expecting when I started reading `A Witch Without Magic,' by Larisa Walk, but I didn't exactly get what I bargained for.The book opens with a riot scene, where neighborhood witch Belladonna is being accused of being a Satanist by her rapidly aging neighbors. In quick fashion, you're introduced to Belladonna's house ghost and house caretaker (for lack of a better word) and the dark witch that is now plotting against her.I think the plot of `A Witch Without Magic' is solid. There's a story here, and it's one that should be told. The problem I have is that things are so rushed, you never get a chance to get a feel for the world Walk has created before it starts crumbling around you.I give Walk credit for opening the book when she did - it was a gutsy move - but it doesn't quite work. For me, I think I would have been more invested in the story if there had been a slower buildup - rather than opening in the midst of an explosion.I don't want to ruin too much of the story, but suffice it to say that Belladonna has suffered a ""catastrophe,"" where she can no longer use the magic she generally relies on. In an attempt to stave off the dark witch that is trying to conquer her, she goes to the Otherworld to try and get a better handle on what's happening to her (and to fix it).The book is interesting - and the typos aren't egregious - so the storyline flows pretty well. Still, I didn't find any of the characters particularly engaging.The book does ask some bigger questions regarding Christianity and Wicca intermingling - which I wasn't exactly expecting. I have no problem with different religions, but I found the author's attempt to create a Christian witch a little baffling.Maybe I'm old school. I just think witches are more fun when you don't try to cage them with religious constraints - but that's just me.All-in-all, I think `A Witch Without Magic' is definitely worth a read - even if I wish certain things had been handled differently."
"01 17, 2013",B009JM9W9K,3.0,Editor shortage due to zombies?,A2EGORFN3BPPSC,I would like to donate a few apostrophes for this book.  It needs serious editing work to be a good read.  And a more mature 24 year old main character.
"06 22, 2014",B009KMW6L0,4.0,Uniquely Original,AXNPRFZJVH1T,"I am always amazed at some of the creativity I come across in books that I find here on the Kindle.  This happens to be one of those cases where I was about to stop reading and come blast the book here in the reviews, but as I read along the whole story suddenly started to make sense.  This made me marvel at the creativity of the author and appreciate what he was trying to accomplish in the book.  Very clever and recommended if you are looking for something off the beaten literary path,."
"03 31, 2013",B009KT2RI0,4.0,"Definitely good,!",AHBARDTLF35PU,"I don't know why this book is not a movie already and I CERTAINLY HOPE there is another book in the works and that it will come out sooner rather than later.I LOVE NEIL and his abilities. YES! It has a TWILIGHT vibe, but  I didn't mind at all.And why are some people complaining about errors and lack of editing, believe me when I tell you, there are more worst than this one.I should say, I didn't like the ending, and sometimes I dindt ike Elle' s righteous thinking but aside from that, I enjoyed this paranormal story. I can t believe I am going to say this, BUT I HOPE THIS IS A SERIES AND I HOPE THE PUBLISHER AND THE WRITER BE SMART AND RELEASE THEM ALL AT THE Same time."

"01 1, 2013",B009M9MILE,5.0,An Absolutely Chaming Story,A37F91YEDN0C4H,"What an absolutely charming story.  This book is so full of beauty and wisdom.  I highly recommend everyone read this story.  If each person can incorporate just one small thing from Lila's wisdom, the world will be a much better place!You will fall in love with all of the characters and the charming coastal town.  This is a coming of age story, with the main characters being Lila Blue and her 12 year old grandaughter, Cassandra.  Lila symbolizes all that is good and wise in the world.  Her quirkly, yet loveable lifestyle helps Cassandra to grow into a mature little lady.  The relationships between the people in the town and the scattered family and friends blend in such a realistic way.  The story reads a lot like you are reading Cassandra's journal/thoughts. The way she describes the world and people around her makes you see the world from the eyes of a 12 year old going from disallusioned, to confused, to joyous and peaceful.  I feel in love with this book.You will not be disappointed in this story.  It is a blessing."

I still have a lot to learn about oven baking, but really, I feel I've improved.My wife's a health buff so she only eats those so-called guilt-free slices of cake. What I'm planning to do is to perfect the appearance of my cakes before baking some for her. At least I know what my cakes are made of, and she can even request what kind of cake she would like to eat. I strongly recommend this book to baking rookies of all ages. You'll surely enjoy all the cake recipes in this book."

"04 24, 2013",B009NZWEA2,4.0,"Nice cover, not my go-to one, but a fun flirty one for a change",A2I1SOYS62NJDT,"This cover is well-made and sturdy and I really like it. I don't like it as much as my other two, but it's a personal preference.  What I do like about the cover: the colors, it's sturdiness, it stands well, the magnet flap works well and I really feel my Kindle is protected.  What I'm a little ho-hum about: the white is bright and stands out against the black Kindle Fire which makes quite a contrast and kind of hurts the eyes, the white also gets dirty easy I noticed, but can be cleaned easy I think and finally it's a little heavy.  I think I got use to a light-weight/non-stand case so this has some heft to it.  But if you are looking for a nice girly fun case that doubles as a stand, this is a great case.  Belkin makes quality products and I'm sure in the long-run this one will outlast my current favorite case."

I'm interested in reading  more of this series. Love the secondary characters as well. It did have some problems. Like the ending. It needed more interaction between the love interests. And when it jumps to another characters POV and then back it throws you off for a minute. But those are problems that are easily fixable for the next book. I hope next book is released asap."

I've always been fond of  post apocalyptic stories, but many of them wind up with the same battles and same issues. This one was different.There were a few places that were a little unbelievable to me, but nothing that made me want to quit reading.I won't spoil the end, but there was a sharp, moving twist at the end that is worth waiting for.I hope to see a sequel!(Note: I received a complimentary copy in exchange for a review)"

"11 17, 2012",B009QVQSF0,4.0,Dark and Difficult,AAQ9C4VXE2GO2,"I read through the night finishing it this morning at 3 am. I do not want to like the book because it was not continuing with the story line of Tash and Raif and/or Stephan as I had expected. However, it continued with Victoria as the mc and how she came into being.It was hard, dark and difficult for Victoria had to endure over 80 years of abuse and hardship. Only towards the end did Stephan came and save the day. Would had preferred it if she saved herself but after such a long time under such abusing environment I doubt that would be feasible. The ending would be more convincing if more were written about how Stephan came about to ""save"" Victoria, passing reference of Supay/Mneseus sending Stephan a ""present"" but no details were given.Overall a good read, tried to put it down numerous time but unable to do so. A bit slow going at times but the story just stick in your head and will not let go.Note: I received a ARC in return for a honest review."

"03 5, 2013",B009U1OZ56,4.0,"Magical beasts, supernaturals, zoos.....oh my!",A3JDPO6DEIHFPC,"How could you?  Just when I was getting wrapped up into the drama, I saw the words ""to be continued"" but I just had to turn the page because I could not believe an author would do this to me but yes, she did.  Jay was a zookeeper at the Bayou Zoo which is no ordinary zoo. It looks like a regular zoo to most people but for the zookeepers it also contains magical creatures.  It is staffed by supernatural beings, with Jay being one such supernatural. I, myself, would love to catch a glimpse of these magical creatures as the thought of keeping such creatures behind closed doors, yet within close proximity with humans, is exhilarating and compelling.  At the zoo, the magical creatures have to be confined securely for fear of what their rampage on the human population would do.  Large-sized beasts, wings, talons, and captivating voices are just a few of the different beast's characteristics that are locked behind the metal bars. For the Bayou Zoo and its supernatural keepers, they do their job 7 days a week tending to the animals the best of their abilities until someone starts to let the creatures out.  Getting into Area 5, where the magical creatures is restricted so who could be behind such violence and why?  Letting these creatures out among the humans is disastrous and catastrophic.  Jay has other issues as well.  Besides being a supernatural, he is dealing with his sexuality and he longs to have his true-self emerge.  This struggle is something that Jay constantly battles and his attention is constantly diverted to. When can he be himself?The author takes off immediately and lets you get to know the characters and the drama from the beginning of the book till the cliff-hanger which was totally enjoyable. I did not enjoy the cliff-hanger but I knew when I went into the book that it was not the full book but I thought at least I would get some closer.  I loved the adventure part of the book and the characters.  They were people you could get to know and not forced into the novel.  Good book and I would now like to read the rest of it. LOL"
"03 21, 2013",B009W3QEHO,4.0,Real people,A30LBR2VOXBST7,"I really enjoyed this story, and it was refreshing to read about characters that actually felt like they were struggling to get by not someone's idea of what struggling is. Reading about billionaries is ok, but it's nice to see characters I can relate to sometimes. There are parts that could feel a bit artifical, but they live in a pretty small setting, so I know stranger things have happened in the real world."

There was some overlapping information from the first one, but it was definitely written to help those single mothers out there and it provided very sound advice.  There were many other factors brought up and new strategies.  Again the book pays for itself."

"11 19, 2012",B009ZLDP8E,5.0,It's a pretty good book,AY62FJ237VP07,"I have read many books on self publishing and quite a few on formatting.  I think what I like most about Crush it was the way it approach's self publishing.  It truly is unlike any other industry, it certainly is a ground floor, actually, I think he missed it a bit as it is probably down in the basement ground floor opportunity with kindle and ebooks.  All in all, he did a nice job in laying out a pretty good road map as to how all of this shapes up.  I am always looking for the free downloads of course, but this is one that I would put on my ""buy"" list.  It's worth the money at any price.  You know, if you pick up just a couple of idea's of how to promote your ebook, and he gives about twenty places that have links to post your book and more practical advise for those of us that really do not have the time nor the inclination to spend all of our time on facebook, twitter or other social media.  His down to earth advice is if you have the time, go for it, but here is a couple of other area's you might want to consider.  I think what I came away from with this book is that we make it harder than it really is in our minds.  If we follow some basic advice, we are indeed going to ""get er done"".  Not a bad philosophy and I have to admit a confidence builder.  I have published quite a few books and I have had problems formatting no matter how simple KDP tells us it is , it ain't.  First book I downloaded took me about eleven hours to format and now it takes about two hours.  He gives a pretty good section on formatting simply from a Word Document and using Kindle to transfer it to mobi.  It really is a lot easier than we give it credit for. Basically, follow his advice on staying the heck away from backspaces, indents and tab's and you might just get it formatted and looking pretty good. I don't want to give the book away, but from someone who has published a bushel of ebooks, I found it quite a pleasant read.  No, I don't know the author, never met him.  Tried to send him a Thank you note and his email didn't go through from his published gmail account.  Too bad, I was going to send him a couple of my books just to Thank him for the great effort he put into this book but now I guess he will have to buy mine.  Give this book some serious consideration. I don't usually post reviews nor do I give out five stars so easy. But this one deserved it. I think you will enjoy the read.  Good book."

"09 24, 2013",B00A0P6W9I,3.0,Interesting short story,ALJ5GGYIKJCNX,An okay read. I enjoyed The Giving Plague mainly due to the way the main character and his gifted colleague looked upon viruses and how their opinions differed. However I felt that the ending was somewhat rushed and could have been further explored. Will definitely look at some of the other works of this author.
"05 9, 2013",B00A1B10CU,4.0,Beyond the Pond,A2Z6KRS3OMTLLJ,"This is a well-written story - written in sections. Its content is geared toward theolder elementary age or young teenagers. It is slightly confusing  in the first partof the book as to what this story was really going to be about. I felt I was readinga story for two different age groups - one group lacking in illustrations. There werea few illustrations that would have appeased the older elementary age.After about a third way through the story really takes a turn. Still, it needed a few moreillustrations. this could be better if revised but it was a great fantasy tale and thecharacter interaction very good.Disclosure: This was generously donated for my review but it is my honest review."
"06 20, 2013",B00A27X6CK,4.0,A DIFFERENT YA MYSTERY!,A2R53V98P2T4Y4,"I have so many thoughts - positive and negative - about this cute YA mystery, I don't know where to start, so I'm just going to throw it all out there in the order it pops into my head. Okay, so first things first. The reason I picked up this book for review is because it sounded fascinating and completely different from the usual YA formula, and indeed this is exactly what it ended up being: different. Suffice to say, I enjoyed it tremendously. The behind-the-scenes parts about what things are like when the cameras aren't rolling and how staged reality shows really are, was a definite eye-opener for me and a big reason why I enjoyed this book so much. The tongue-in-cheek mention of sponsors providing food to showcase their brands during the filming of each episode of ""Seven is Heaven"", was a nice touch, and yet another eye-opener for anyone who thought reality shows are reality. I have to add here that I'm not a fan of reality tv, so naturally, the Kardashians and other such similar shows hold no attraction for me (and also because said Kardashians is a firm favorite with my hubby).So on to the story. The mystery elements were well plotted and kept me guessing all the way. Most of it was unpredictable and the real culprit at the end was someone I didn't suspect at all. The little bit of romance there is in this story happens more towards the end and is - thank goodness - not the main focus or the key element driving the plot. I didn't much care for most of the characters and I especially didn't like Estella's mom. The things she and her husband, Barry, made the sextuplets and Estella do for the sake of entertainment was sometimes downright bad parenting. I couldn't view Estella's mom as anything other than pretentious and shallow, and even when the cameras weren't rolling I found her to be cold and distant. A few of the sextuplets got more attention than the rest of their siblings and Estella also seemed to have her own favorites, but overall I found the six younger siblings the most entertaining of the entire cast of characters.  Estella is okay if you add a pinch of salt and I felt as frustrated as she did with all the grown-ups withholding the truth from her and trying to keep her in the dark about her father, but sometimes she annoyed me with her bratty behavior. If ever I came across a contradicting main character, she was definitely it. The one character I did like a lot was Steve. He seemed to be the most balanced of all of them and if I ever need a bodyguard, I would like to have someone like him. Not only did he safeguard Estella and her family, he is also a terrific friend to her and her siblings. There were times though when his evasiveness frustrated me as I felt he could've provided some of the answers Estella needed. But that's neither here nor there and his caginess didn't lessen my overall enjoyment of the story.Like I said before, Reality Ends Here is an engaging mystery which made for a fun, quick and fluffy read. The author kept it straightforward and drew me into the world of reality television with a flourish. The ending was good, but rather anticlimactic after all that build-up. Not the exciting finale I had hoped for, but definitely one I didn't expect. I'd recommend this book for readers aged twelve and up.I received a copy of this book from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest, unbiased review."
"02 20, 2013",B00A285EHY,2.0,Tennessee Touch,ASCG5HMF62QQ8,I read the first quarter of this book before I just put it down and gave up. I hated the way the writer worded her sentences and the whole idea of the book was confusing. It starts out in Washington with him keeping things from her after they had a sign language conversation on the interstate. That right there was hard to believe. I didn't like it but others might enjoy the odd story line.

"12 19, 2012",B00A6VHADI,5.0,Curl up with this wonderful read!!!,A1FJFLAAQD5WH2,Emilie and her aunt live in a huge house and have plenty of money. She is a teacher that works with at-risk youth. The one thing Emilie wants more than anything is to adopt a child. But it is so hard for a single woman to adopt. She thought her dreams were about to come true but yet again she is denied because the person giving the child up will only allow a two parent household to adopt the child.Nick is a mechanic and he has taken in his niece and nephew after his sister's tragic death. He promised her he would give her children the one thing she and Nick didn't have: two parents.Nick and Emilie meet when he tows her car. She soon learns that he is the man offering the little girl for adoption. He doesn't know she is the rich woman wanting to adopt his niece. When she finds out they need a place to stay over the holidays she invites them to stay with her. She hopes to convince him she is the perfect person to adopt his niece and his nephew as well.Neither of them expected what happened next.Cozy mystery authors Jim and Joyce Lavene bring us a wonderful Christmas love story.Emilie's heart had been broken before by a man who couldn't deal with her disability. She just was so afraid to open herself up to that kind of pain again. She knew she could make a good home for a child on her own and that was what she planned to do. Then Nick entered her life and as she tried to prove to him she didn't need a man in her life they just kept getting closer and closer. It was so easy to connect with these characters.The Lavene's have written a captivating love story that will pull at your heartstrings. It unfolds at a perfect pace with the expected misunderstandings and drama but there is humor and more depth than usually found in romance novel today. Emilie's work just with Adam - striving to get to the bottom of his behavior. She is a very special teacher.If you are looking for a book to curl up with this holiday season this is one I highly recommend!
"11 21, 2012",B00A7Z8VE0,5.0,A Great Resource For Children!,AIG4PIBSV1PC,"If you are looking for a great little book that will keep your young ones busy for a long time, this is the book that will get the job done.  The thing I really like about this book is the fact that it's very interactive.  It's not another book that tells some sort of story.  Children have to make choices to get the correct answers.  It's a great learning tool."
"11 15, 2012",B00A81XLNO,5.0,THEY COME AT NIGHT!,A2O9ZGE4NN9XP1,"Michael McBride is one of heckuva a writer. It doesn't matter what he writes because it seems he is incapable of disappointment.  Personally,  I think he is a master at the novella form and Snowblind show that in spades. Bill and three of his lifelong college buddies get together for their annual hunting trek up in the mountains(they've been doing so since their college days and they're now middle aged). As fate would have it one of them breaks their leg crossing a river. As a result, the group gets lost in no man's land and have to hole up in a rundown shack/cabin until they can figure how to get out of there and send one of them to get help for there injured friend.But something else has plans for them. It will hunt them. It will trap them. It will play games with them. It is smart. It is hungry. It is deadly. The isolation and despair McBride evokes in this novella is razor sharp: On a snow-covered mountain, lost in the middle of nowhere with something out of your worst nightmare hunting and taunting you while a blizzard is freezing you to death and there's no one to help. I really liked that he didn't drop the creature(s) on us from the get go and let us know what it is. Instead it's kind of a slow burn to the point where he reveals little by little what is hunting them. You probably won't be able to figure out what the creature(s) is before it's fully revealed towards the end, even with the excellent bits of descriptions he gives us about them. McBride's knowledge of anatomy seems to be pretty solid with the various descriptions he gives of injuries. All I'll say about this particular creature(s) is that it seems to be rather popular in fiction right now. I've read 3 stories based on it in the last couple of months.... one from a fairly big publisher. And, no, it's not zombies!I also very much liked that the group of friends find a secret(maybe not a secret but a discovery) in the cabin that is related to the beastie(s) hunting them(hint: it's not the beasties' first rodeo;). I would have like to of seen a little extra added depth with this secret.... maybe expanded upon later on(there actually is a very small part to it later but not enough for my taste). I hate to say too much b/c I really want this to be a joy and a surprise to read for horror fans. The characterizations and dialogue are first rate for this size of story. In other words, it's lean and mean without being bogged down by too much wordiness, but you get still get a good feel for the characters and their lives. This novellla is bit unusual for McBride in that it's pretty much straight horror and if you're familiar with his work know that's not his typical M.O. He's more of a hybrid writer mixing sci-fi, horror, and dark fantasy.This was a superb story with a pretty cool ending that I would recommend to any horror fan. I've read pretty much all of McBride's work and so far Snowblind is my favorite. It's pure straightforward unrelenting horror that goes for the throat(pun intended). Pick up a copy and I dare you not to have a great time reading it! Three bucks is a steal!"

This book was not only entertaining, it also had a fantastic plot! I immediately fell in love with the witty banter between sisters Parcifal and Lernea! The story only gets more and more exciting as each new character of the party of five gets introduced. It's been so long since I'd read a story with pirates in it, but Party if Five really clenches that thirst. Kalampakas' fast-paced style will keep you wanting more. I can't wait to read the sequel!"
"07 29, 2013",B00A8PL3TY,3.0,Short and Sweet,AR5WJIS4HEHNE,"This book left out a lot of the emotions and feelings for some hot once a month sex.

It seemed like the emotions were thrown in as an after thought to show why the two characters were right for each other.  One thing that I really enjoyed was the revelation at the end and how both characters were using the time as an escape from reality and as a result found the right person for them.  Both were experiencing major issues with home life and they found a point in which they could connect.This book was free from the publisher and in no way influenced my review."
"01 16, 2013",B00A8S6NAA,4.0,My Perspective,A3HFO443B854PU,"This book highlights a very important message. Love has no color. In my opinion, interracial couples are beautiful. People are exploring different cultures."
"01 14, 2013",B00A92CMRI,5.0,Two words: Freaking Awesome.,AVKO1AAZTCKRX,"Two words: Freaking Awesome.My favorite books are always the ones that I continually quote throughout and find I simply MUST repeat the character's lines without fail like every other paragraph. Seriously. And Finned went like this:""He kept staring at my legs. Did my jeans offend him?"" *chuckle*snort* BB repeats line aloud to be certain it's as funny as it sounds INSIDE my head.It totally is! *giggle*snort* some more... 2 sentences later:""Keep an eye on Mr. Smarmy."" *hehe* the whole process then repeats itself.Okay, so down to business!! Were you wondering if I was actually ever getting to the REVIEW part of this `book review'?Marina Valentine has been BANNISHED by a chick with ""lime green hair, orange eyes, and a nose the size of Chesapeake Bay Bridge."" (you like the word pictures as much as I do, don't you?) for reading (tarot) cards.She apparently predicted two murders and aided terrorist mentality!! I know right? One of those murders was her very own father, and the Imperia Canon of Peculiar Malfunctions chose to ignore her, and then banish her and her mother AFTER the fact. As a part of her banishment, Marina is blocked from ANY future reading, or they'll kill her immediately!""Should you touch even a single card with a bare or gloved hand, we will know, as will the Imperia. Such an offense will result in your immediate execution.""Hmmm... Smells fishy to me!!Her and her mother are banished to Saxet Shores, Texas where the `Normals' (anyone who doesn't belong to the Ravenflames or the Fairhairs) are shunned.""painting her nails her favorite color, Undead Red."" ... Ummm I believe I need this color. I mean REALLY.""we'll throw you a going-to-die party. That's polite, right?""Marina's mom is simply an EPIC, EPIC character... She's hilarious and every time she popped up in a scene, I knew laughing would soon ensue.""My keys are gone! Someone's stolen my keys! Wait. Found them. Let's go."" ... This is the STORY of my life!!! Whenever I can't find something- someone has stolen it!!!!! Until I find it in the refrigerator or somewhere equally inappropriate. *sigh*Troy Tombolo ... Fairhair and local heartthrob has stolen Marina's attention, but they can never be together because of the social hierarchy and its plain to see that something BIGGER than meets the eye is going on.A series of disappearances, her mother goes completely crazy and Troy FINALLY confesses his feelings for Marina in a very BOY-like way (insensitive jerks!) ... and Marina isn't sure she can take anymore. But she's about to find out she can survive all that and MORE.Marina was a fantastic character, her mother was SIMPLY FABULOUS and Troy had some SUPER swoon-worthy moments when his guy-filter was working...""My heart stops when I'm near you and bleeds when I'm away from you.""*dies*FINNED is a fun, sharp-witted tale of Merpeople, Normals, first love, some heart-pounding action and a centuries old war that everyone is still fighting.And MerRacing?? Oh. My. God. BEST THING EVER!!! Seriously- one of the coolest freaking scenes I've ever read in my life. Troy is like the Kyle Busch of the Merworld. I love it!!"
"12 21, 2013",B00A937COU,5.0,Great author,A1CEP0ILCOQCTB,Kennedy writes a fast paced book with well developed characters and plenty of twists. I tend to try to figure out &#34;who did it&#34; before the end of the story. Kennedy fakes me out more often than not with believable twists to the story. I have read all the books by this author that I can get my hands on and have never been disappointed.

"07 10, 2013",B00A9H95JQ,4.0,Some Suspense and A Little Confusion,A2LB0KM18TZOVT,"I had a hard time connecting with this novel. I can't really explain it, because the writing was alright. It just seemed like the characters were something but then they were something else. Like, Dani was a graphic designer, but oh, she was also a French model. Van was a fighter, but oh he was also a fireman. It all just seemed kind of... Off. Then there was the Brian thing, and the parent thing, and the diamonds (wtf?). Then let's throw in Marnie and Paul's problems and the parent interference and Jaime's divorce and Cole's involvement and feelings for Dani, but then don't really wrap it up. I did like the sweet scenes between Dani and Van, especially the Epilogue. I think that Cole was my favorite character. He seemed the most real. The author kind of sets up a possible spin off story for him. I would definitely read that."
"04 13, 2013",B00A9HDEHA,3.0,Love and pleasure.,A1T24CW443O0XE,The book was good but it kind of lose me a few times but was overall a good book. I was looking for Ben to propose to Victoria and start a family of their own.
"03 20, 2013",B00A9I4X74,1.0,An Idiot in Love,A1SUBNRTTOI3RV,"Really wasn't my cup of tea. I thought it would have been funny but not really at all. And the language is awful. I know that kids talk that way but I don't really want to read it. I put it down after the 5th chapter, first time I have ever not finished a book."
"07 3, 2013",B00A9I4X74,3.0,An Idiot in Love,A24Z79OS5VQA7Y,I had read a lot of the reviews for this book and was hoping for the comic relief promised.  I found it rather self indulgent and not that funny myself.  The author tells the tales of all the women in his life but he seems rather lost himself.  I didn't feel much connection with the character unfortunately.  I really did want to like this book more.
"02 9, 2013",B00A9UXL7U,5.0,Awesomeness,A65TGGMSYZ9FR,"CM Stunich has a new fan! I was gifted this book and honestly didn't know how I'd like it, I've never read a werewolf story I didn't think I could get into it Boy was I so ever wrong! CM does an awesome job as she draws you in and clearly sets the whole story up in your head. Very descriptive Very detailed Very good I loved it! I will now and forever be a ""were"" reader, Well at least CM' s. I can't wait to read more of her work."
"12 30, 2012",B00AAJ9DKE,5.0,Gets you in the spirit...,A3S5PBDFQ8DW5U,"Emlyn Chand does it again with the latest in her Bird Brain books. As you can see by the title, this one finds the featured bird having to lend a hand to keep children all over the world from being disappointed on Christmas.Each book focuses on a different breed of bird. Fittingly, Chand uses a Penguin for this installment who decides to travel all the way to the North Pole to thank Santa in person for a gift he gave her. When she arrives, she finds out that Santa is facing a problem that could end up cancelling his yearly ride and jumps into action.As with the other Bird Brain books, Chand doesn't simplify her word choices. This provides a great opportunity for parents to expand their children's vocabulary while they also learn life lessons. Courtney's year-long journey to thank Santa teaches kids about gratitude and her willingness to help when asked also provides a great example. The illustrations are also colorful and cute, sure to keep a child's attention. If you are looking for a last minute read to close off the holidays, pick this one up."
"11 28, 2012",B00AAWT5RW,5.0,Quick and Concise,A2GBS46HJ1IBH3,"When I first saw this book it struck a chord with me. When I was younger I had a dog whose constant digging under the fence and escaping led to us having to give her away. With only six chapters, this guide is a pretty quick read. Each chapter covers a different problem you might be having with your dog, from digging, to making sure it has identification, to preventing him from getting out of the house, etc. The book's concise layout and simple instructions make this guide a real winner. Definitely worth checking out if you are having doggy issues."
"05 15, 2014",B00AB05RRU,4.0,Great book,A3RYEBQ9NPB43R,This book started a bit quickly but lasted long enough to make me care about the story - enjoyable read.
"08 11, 2013",B00AB4KSIY,5.0,Yet another awesome book in this series!,AXZU59MEQO6KZ,"Book 7 in Brides of the Kindred is yet another exciting, erotic (to the max) and sometimes funny book. We know about Lissa and Saber (great name) from book 6. Finally we get to learn more about them and why they can't seem to get over the outdated rules of their planet when it comes to mating within ones clan even though there is no blood relation. They travel to a very strange planet to get historical scrolls about how Draven (very bad guy) was defeated during a war a thousand years ago. This planet is run by women and the males are their slaves and are punished in some pretty serious ways of they do not obey quickly and consistently. Lissa had to pose as this type of women with Saber as her slave. They went through some really sexy punishments and some not so good. But the love they felt for each other finally came to the forefront when they could no longer deny their feelings. A few twists in this one came into play and a few times I was wondering what was going to happen on the Mother Ship. Actually, it turned out to be very funny even though it was Draven causing all the havoc. Really good read with alot going on and several character stories playing out at the same time. Have fun with this one!"
"01 9, 2013",B00ACAFI6Y,5.0,This Parody Fifty Shades of Fried book 3 is great,ASDR27Y4CD8WE,This 3rd book of Fifty Shades of Beige is great.  I enjoyed all of these books. Reid Mockery's writing is very entertaining and will keep you reading and wanting more.
"09 29, 2013",B00AD6F2J0,5.0,Never discount the actions of a novice,ABYR4KDE8JU61,I found this story fun to read.  Often it is comical as well.  Talk about the blind leading the blind.  The main character kept getting into scrapes he clearly was unqualified to tackle.  You will have to read the story to find out how the author deals with the situations.
"04 12, 2013",B00ADI0S7O,5.0,Fun and entertaining,AG76DC9XBZJAM,"You're sure get a kick out of romantic suspense novel, The Next Right Thing, by Colleen Collins. Ms. Collins, who's written in both the romance and suspense genres, is a master. Her characters are lively and funny, and the story unfolds like a magic carpet, where you'll be swept away by the romance, but brought back to earth with the plot.The story reads like a romance: boy meets girl; boy jilts girl; boy and girl are replete with misunderstandings and regret; boy and girl fall in love. But beyond the romance, there's also the legal thriller aspect with a few white-knuckle cliff-hangers where you'll end up reading for a bit longer than you might have intended! The two components align to create a perfect summer read."
"04 10, 2013",B00AEBEWA4,4.0,When We Touch Review by @Shawna 's Survey,A14Y2IYBI8G90S,"Just when I said I would never do this to myself again. I find myself back in the trap that Beth Kery has set for me.Another weekly, two chapters at a time, 8 part series, that once I complete will be over my personal book limit price....dun dun duuuun. I know. I need to be commited to rehab for my excessive addiction to mommy porn.So I have to admit that the story kinda started out slow, because of that dreadful need to setup a back story for the characters. When I was thinking that it was time to put this one on my DNF list things started to come to life for me. Man drama!Lucien who has relocated from Paris for some unknown suspicious reason is the proud Chicagoresturant owner of Fusion; he has found his top chef in an uncompromising position with a woman from his past. Did I forget to mention they were drinking his private stock of Cognac Dudognon H&eacute;ritage from his office.So immediately you know an altercation is  about to go down.Moving on....the woman from his past who happens to be Elise Martin, she came to Chicago to complete her culinary studies. Apparently,  she and Lucien knows each other from their families, but all Lucien can think of his how can he get rid of her.In case you're wondering that's not going to happen. If it did we there wouldn't be a story.Right!So somehow Ms. Kery was so gracious to include Ian Noble and his beloved Francesca,  not really sure of their position at this time.Only time how this will play out."
"09 15, 2013",B00AECHQBK,2.0,Cool ideas,A1WGJ79HRDVN3N,The book consisted of little projects that anyone can do. Good to have in your personal library. May use someday

"06 29, 2013",B00AF62EX0,4.0,Short but Entertaining,A1KSK0XANJ3WXM,"This is a short novel, perhaps not technically of novel length. It is well-written, with some interesting situations and characters. I will read the next one."
"03 4, 2013",B00AGHJXZ0,5.0,Great book,A1Q5YJZ5HMRGA8,I definitely needed to up my income level so started looking for books that would give me ideas--this was one of the very best ones!

"01 4, 2014",B00AGZEHYO,3.0,Interesting premise,A2TGQ7HJVTLELF,I enjoyed the idea of this book although at times my attentionwandered a bit. I would have liked a clearer ending ... unless of course a sequel is in the works. I hope so!
"01 19, 2013",B00AHPNHB2,4.0,Good,A29UVDFW2RXBD8,Enjoyed the book. I'm use to the writing style now. Not my favorite just because it showcase my favorite characters is all.

"06 14, 2013",B00AHRE74G,4.0,:-),A3IKRMIPKPJ4EF,This series isn't my normal read but it was good. There's enough action and suspense to keep you engaged. Some parts are a little gag worthy though!
"11 26, 2013",B00AIAR4UG,5.0,"Warm, funny and sweet!",AZNA0A1FUZX8V,"Well what a surprise this book was! I wasn't really sure what to expect and was looking for something a little different as I was getting bored with the mysteries I usually read. I thought this might be a little dry but probably interesting, so I picked it up. Boy was I wrong! This is far from dry. It's funny, sweet, informative and quite fast paced. It grabs you in and takes you on a truly enjoyable ride with collage student Richard on his first foray into the working world and world of antiques. I honestly enjoyed this book and am looking forward to the rest in this trilogy. Well done!"
"02 21, 2014",B00AJ1VLOY,5.0,As a boxed set Caliber Detective Agency is a fun read,AA0106JXO0TKZ,"The first 6 stories were a fun read. The stories and the characters were tongue in cheek but I thought the plots and characters were well developed with the common theme of the Caliber family running through them. The flashbacks to the 1880's Texas were handled well and were integrated into the modern day story line. Each story (Case File) was an easy read and all fit together well. I probably would not have enjoyed each story by itself but as a boxed set, the stories are a good value. I particularly liked not finding spelling and grammar errors. And the paragraph formatting with proper spacing and short paragraphs made reading these stories easier."
"01 7, 2013",B00AJIVB4C,2.0,Doesn't match up to the paperback issue,AVX3CX52UUDIQ,"It still covers the same information, but looses a lot in a person being able to grasp all the articles and the order you might want to read them in, that is possible in the paperback. The paperback is easier to travel with and you don't worry about forgetting where you put it."
"12 15, 2012",B00AL62CZY,4.0,Canine Parody of the Twelve Days of Christmas,AIO247KHD2O40,"This book has been around for a while as a physical picture book, it's pretty popular in the library where I work, it's even been turned into a movie on DVD (although obviously with a fair bit more content than this book). This is the first time I've come across this on Kindle so decided to get it.  There isn't a storyline to this it's basically a parody of the classic Twelve Days of Christmas song, done dog themed starting off, ""On the first day of Christmas my true dog sent to me.""  Note you can also getThe Twelve Cats of Christmasif you prefer the lesser species.  The artwork is probably the reason to get this though. I am especially impressed by the final image of a Christmas tree made up of a heap of dogs. Although to be critical of the Kindle version, which is just the book opened to each two pages and scanned into the top 1/3rd of the screen, some of these illustrations come out to be a bit small.  You can of course zoom in and do other things but you shouldn't have to it should display better.  You'd think something published by a professional publisher would do a better job than most self-published picture books do.I don't want to give away the whole poem but a sample of the parody is twelve dogs a digging, eleven puppies pooping, ten labs a licking.  To read the rest you'll have to buy this."
"12 10, 2012",B00ALIN0XK,5.0,Even better than the first,A3JKY9ON7KA6CU,"I requested a copy of this book prior to its release because I enjoyed the first book so much. In exchange, I promised an honest review.The original Sub-Normal short story, NOT THE NORM, was excellent except for one slight niggle in that it seemed like a story of two halves, though I enjoyed it anyway. I think UNMASKED ALLOY is a better, more coherent and solid telling of one particular event. It also helps that we know the characters already, so we join them without preamble.The author begins the story at exactly the right moment, right after the capture of fugitives Eden and Dake. This tale is not about what they were doing or where they were before capture, or about the capture itself; it's solely about what happens while they're being marched away -- Eden to a holding cell, and Dake to his execution. Being a short story, this is just a single but important event in their lives on the lam.The possibilities for other stories are absolutely endless. I'm kind of a slow reader, and it makes a really nice change to dive in for a quick and exciting adventure that only takes an hour at most! I definitely look forward to the next.Readers are advised to read NOT THE NORM first because it introduces the characters and explains Eden's flawed ability (which is is only hinted at in UNMASKED ALLOY). Basically, read these short stories as a serial and wait impatiently for the next."
"12 19, 2013",B00ALKTTN8,5.0,Another great story,A1B1544LCGF82I,I still can't believe how Mike & Casey bring these children around. They have such patience! I loved their family too.. they have amazing relationships with their son & daughter.I don't where Casey finds the time to write all these stories when she is so busy! I plan on getting another one of her books. Will be my 5th!
"07 17, 2013",B00ALTVIJC,5.0,A Pleasant Surprise,A27K3IELCYKZ5Z,"'Far in the Wilds' is not what I would normally expect from Harlequin Mira. This isn't a romance, but it is a great read. The writing is superb. I found myself rereading many of the passages. I felt as if I was there, experiencing the exotic, rugged lifestyle of Colonial Africa. Big game hunter and safari guide, Ryder White, is the perfect damaged hero. As soon as I finished reading this prequel novella, I had to buy and read the sequel, 'A Spear of Summer Grass.' Both books are simply awesome!"
"09 13, 2013",B00ALUF3RO,5.0,Great background,A2WSYAJ9X1QPWU,Great lead-in to Life After Theft.  It truly helped to understand the motivation of the main characters in Life After Theft.

"01 16, 2013",B00AM986QE,5.0,soul mate,AE6LJH1MRZVSY,yes just like the movie and the movie remake but with 2 guys. Just when you think a story can't get a new twist; a story like this comes along. Very good and yes you will cry and laugh. good no great story.
"12 28, 2013",B00AMIX8P4,4.0,Blast from the past,A3NMO3K0QVQH66,"An interesting story with 2 people knowing each other since they were kids.Could it possibly turn into more? Hell, yeah!"
"01 8, 2014",B00AMQ6U3S,3.0,for youngsters,A13351DSHQAIT7,"Really a book for girls below age of 15. If you like that sort of stuff, this one's for you."

They reach out to friends and take on big challenges but the peace between them as a couple is solid and heartwarming.  Love their Wrap up.  Hope the little tease at the end means another story for this brand new character.
"11 10, 2013",B00AMROAYS,2.0,Don't bother,A36PZNHTJG77XU,"This book is not historically accurate, and is distorted from scripture. In fact, I fear it's rank heresy. Don't waste your tie or money."
"12 23, 2012",B00AMW3KR6,2.0,Had promise,A1FMMK4M1GHIVO,"But the execution of this book was not so great.  There are many grammar/spelling errors, wrong tenses used, and the dialog seemed like the author was trying too hard.  And there are continuity errors.  I usually enjoy cheesy, Christmassy books, even better if they contain princes in them but this was too badly put together.  Oh, and in the middle there are two whole pages of preaching.  I wanted to like this but I just couldn't."
"03 8, 2013",B00AN3SER0,4.0,More,A260QWDG3JXMNF,Again couldn't wait for the next part of the story - I really like to start these types of books when all the stories are out
"03 4, 2013",B00ANG0812,5.0,Why isn't there more?,A2SAF8DIUEZHPK,"Oh man.... I really loved this book. I found myself staying up to 4:30am to finish reading it (even though I had work the next day). Often when I buy erotica books, I am apprehensive if the story line is even going to be there or if the characters are going to be well developed. This book had it all... plot, good story, character depth.Now, for those reviewers who are comparing it to Fifty Shades... would you get over it already!? Why do people compare everything erotica to fifty freaking shades!? do you compare every work of fiction to one book? No. So don't give this book a poor review because there wasn't a billionaire and psychological issues.I could actually see this book happening and I want MORE!Buy it."
"02 16, 2013",B00ANY2C7W,3.0,Entertaining,A2MPXRI0R0FQNS,This book was entertaining and well written but borderline silly.  The rogue whales added a fairy tale aspect to the book that distracted me from the story.
"06 15, 2014",B00AOHGJXG,5.0,Very much fun to read,AZNQNCC2YMR5R,First I have read by this author. Probably not the last. The characters were well written. I enjoyed the Fae side as it was different from many of the genre.
"01 22, 2013",B00APOR7U2,5.0,Mary O'Reilly Mystery,A1PVCC0H7KLYHM,Very entertaining and serious and a love story and the Paranormal.  Shows great family values and the search for the truth with a little extra help.  I recommend this series to anyone who believes in esp and right and wrong.
"12 6, 2013",B00APT8BDE,4.0,Nice Story,A2U2NWT251ZYWB,I really enjoyed this book.  The story was sweet and romantic.  I really liked the fact that the H and h knew each other from childhood.
"12 29, 2012",B00APX9DSC,4.0,True to her character,A1MEVZK267DP4J,"This is a very short story, but one that gives added depth to the ""Mayne Attraction"" series.  One of the first things I noticed about the story was the consistent nature of Ellery's character. As a devoted fan of Ann Mauren's  In the Spotlight Series, I was thrilled to have another piece of the puzzle.  But, like other readers the suspense is killing me while I wait for her next full length release in the series.  Till then, this little story will tide you over till we're able to dive into more of Ellery's story."
"02 15, 2013",B00APZQV4Y,5.0,I didn't think he could do it again.,A1PIOGAH1SCWK3,"I absolutely LOVED The Cabin. I didn't think it was possible for a sequel to do it justice. I was prepared to read a middle-of-the-road story which perhaps just dragged the story out a little ala Paranormal Activity...However, I am willing to admit that Matt Shaw knows how to pen a flipping amazing story when he really wants to. I couldn't keep up with this one and I could not see how the story was going to play out. It was a fantastic ending. It was just as creepy and terrifying as the first book.Loved it. Read it in one sitting. More please. :)"
"01 27, 2013",B00AQ13MJO,4.0,Intriguing start to an awesome new series!,A24J3MGRASYNA4,This was an intriguing start to what promises to be an excellent short story series. Willow Cross is a pro at telling a wicked good ghost story and this in no exception. I really found myself feeling for the characters and even though the story wasn't very long it definitely left you wanting more. I am excited to read the next bit of story because I can't wait to see what happens next and how it all ties together in the end. If you are looking to read something that goes bump in the night Ghost Diaries is definitely recommended.
"07 18, 2014",B00AQJRYWC,3.0,Truth set them free,A2HM4GZG1COYLI,I always heard that once you start telling lies you have to keep it up.  Nick and Abbey started their relationship on lies.  After a whole week they couldn't get it out they loved each other.  So they parted ways and lived miserable for a month until they once again had to come face to face on a business deal. At the last few minutes they both realized they lived each other

I grabbed Patti's first Hayle book from the Free Kindle book list, and I was immediately hooked.I'm a huge fan of Mercedes Lackey, Anne Bishop, Anne Rice, etc. I would place Patti Larsen right up there with these authors.Trust me - if you are an avid reader, and you enjoy a good storyteller - read Patti Larsen.

Each character had their life & it all went together so well.  Just seemed so peaceful there you could put yourself in Pecan Creek. A  book I couldn't put down & can't wait for the next one.

"07 3, 2014",B00ATRCPSE,3.0,Tries too hard,A2V6F4L44N1GI0,I was quite interested in reading a serial novel. I have enjoyed others in the past and loved them. This one though was the pits. The author tries way too hard to make this book exciting and suspenseful and it shows. I wont be bothering with the rest of the books in this series.
"05 31, 2013",B00AU50VD6,5.0,A great vampire story with depth and a strong protagonist.,A1CGOR398UH1IB,"On the night of Jeff and Jenny's twelfth anniversary, they are viciously attacked while returning to their car.Two weeks later, Jenny wakes up from a coma. Her husband is dead.Assured her two children are being cared for, she lies in the hospital bed, struggling to remember what happened that night. She draws a blank.The longer she lies in that bed, the weaker she gets. She aches all over. Even her hair hurts. And she's so thirsty and hungry.Detective Benjamin Bradley is assigned to her case and questions her about what she remembers, but she still can't recall anything.She wishes she could remember. She has many questions. Who attacked them? Were they going to be back to finish the job? She prayed it was all over and she and her children were safe.Her brother Joey flies up from Summer Haven, Florida, their home town. He suggests she and the kids come back there and stay in their parents empty house. It's neglected, but nothing Jenny can't fix herself.Jenny and her kids settle into the family farmhouse. It comes with its own mystery.The townsfolk claim it's haunted. People have seen lights moving around in the house. Some people claim to have heard her fathers horses, though they are long dead.Jenny continues to get weaker and can't eat. She begins to suspect the awful truth. She is becoming the thing she despises most.""She was changing even more. She could feel it in her bones, her flesh, and her very thoughts. What happened if she mutated into something alien?""Years ago, Joey and Jenny battled a gang of vampires and succeeding in burning them up in the old theater, but not before many people died, including their parents.She can no longer deny what attacked her that night, or what she is becoming.And who is the mysterious tall man shadowing her? He stays in the shadows, a gaunt white figure. What does he want from her? Is he one of them?Jenny worries. She worries about making ends meet. She worries about the long-term. How do you hide not getting older? How can she be a mother to her children when what she craves, what she needs, is human blood?She worries.What do I think?The first thing I loved about this book was the cover art. It's dark and dreary. You can feel a menacing presence, and Jenny is standing bravely between whatever lurks out there and her children.I love a strong female protagonist and Jenny is like a momma bear with her cubs. You know how that is.She's dealing with losing her husband, moving back home, turning into a loathsome vampire, and worrying about her children.I liked how she went about learning more about her `condition' and how she taught herself to adapt.I enjoyed how the author revealed Jenny and Joeys history with the vampires. It explained how she reacted to what she is.The mystery of the lights and the ghostly horses isn't a focal point in the story, but it does stay in the back of your mind. The author refers to it vaguely at first, but slips more into the story as you read along.These vampires are different and I was surprised when the author came up with a new way of becoming one.When Jenny turns, it makes sense.This isn't a funny story. There are fun moments, but Human No Longer has depth, with strong secondary characters and several complications for Jenny to deal with. All while trying to keep her children safe.I was riveted right from the beginning and would love to read about what happened with Jenny and Joey and their parents previously. That would be a great story.The characters are strong, the plot is intriguing, the story is fleshed out, and I got a great ending."

It was sexy, a little scary, and still pulled at the heart strings. I enjoyed it and wouldn't mind reading more about these characters. Like what happens after all of this took place."
"01 18, 2013",B00AUYINB4,4.0,Adventures in life,A15MSVCXKYTGIF,"These stories are a bite out of a full life, little things that make you smile and nod.  In a few places they could be tightened up to flow better but they have a great charm to them.  As you move through the stories they get better.  Going from a bit awkward to a smooth and heart touching flow.  They author needs to write more.  She gives an insight into a way of life that in the 21st century isn't seen as much.  The travel stories are funny but the family stories are strong and at time gripping.  And the poem she included was very strong as were the studies of nature in all her glory.  Looking forward to more."
"01 1, 2013",B00AV4X9TO,5.0,Can the bad boy be good deep down inside?,AHWG1XHY140G1,"Jasinda does it again and I want more of this story.  When I read the Big Girls series I was torn between Chase and Jeff because I married my Jeff, but what girl/woman isn't attracted to the bad boy like Chase.  This new series seems to prove that a bad boy can have a good side deep down that he hides to protect his image.  I think the journey will be bumpy for Chase and Jaime as they try to avoid causing Anna pain, but this bad boy and bad girl might be able to find that together they can be good."

It's the sort of thing that can easily be understood and enjoyed by younger readers, while at the same time being just as entertaining for adults. I liked how the author reintroduced us (or introduced us for the first time) to the first Doctor's personality without going overboard. It's a nice reminder of the ways he's changed and stayed the same over the years!"

Kean doesn't want to go against Araya's wishes but begins to feel for Araya.Jocelyn Dex delivers this story in a quick, sexy novella.

"02 7, 2013",B00B083LO8,4.0,Beautiful story,A1XUJTF439KVX2,This was a wonderful story told very well and I am eager to read the rest. I'm guessing what will come next but I hope I am pleasantly surprised.For the next installment I ask that the author turns on spell and grammar checker and asks someone to look it over before submitting.
"05 22, 2014",B00B0J815Q,5.0,Loved all three books.,A3BHXRE0RKF4LK,Genevieve Jourdin has great talent in writing from both a male and female point of view. It was very cool seeing the same event from both points of view.
"06 24, 2013",B00B0JP38Y,4.0,frustrating book but well worth the read,A3BKJYAJCE9GK4,"Honestly, at some points in the book I would have given it a three heart for the simple purpose of how can this author keep having Bailey continue to be abused by so many people and NO ONE did anything about it.  The police wasn't called, the school appeared to have only a handful of staff members yet NO ONE saw anything.  She was able to be so beaten that she had to spend days in the hospital and yet NO ONE reported it to the staff or police.  I was getting so furious because she was telling her story to people, she was trying to let them know that she had no place that was she safe and NO ONE did anything to stop this abuse.  Needless to say I was so furious at that point I was about to throw the kindle across the room, but I love my kindle too much.Then I found myself slowly getting it, why no one reported it.  Why she was always the victim and there were a couple of times I gasped out loud and had my family looking at me like I had inhaled a fly or something.  If you can get through the part when everyone turned their heads and wait for the pieces to all fall in place you will see why I am giving this book a four heart.  I will insert here that the only reason I am not giving it a five heart rating is I think the victim role was carried to far and I really hope all readers will finish the book to understand why it was done like this.Now the ending.  If you hate cliff hangers you will want to wait till the whole trilogy is out because this was the mother of all cliff hangers. I finished the last page and sat there staring at it like the next page would magically appear.  I can tell you, if you are loving books that tug at every emotion you have then this is the one for you.  I really admire that she took such a topic as bullying and school shootings and gave us a glimpse into the mind of the victim of bullying.  I don't agree with any sort of violence, I will stand against any form of bullying, but I don't think society can risk in this day and age, to continue to hide from that fact that abuse and bullying push kids to do the unimaginable things.  Does this make the shooters bad kids?  I would have said yes two days ago, now I have to stop and re-evaluate that decision."
"01 11, 2014",B00B0WFHKU,5.0,Great read,A18RH223NQXT25,I really enjoyed this book. It was full of  intrigue. Showing the reader how gossip and miscommunication make it hard for  a true relationship to survive. So you must talk things out.
"06 5, 2013",B00B0XBQX6,4.0,Bad Karma,A2VU3TBZDCP8QA,"It takes a talented writer to take an unlikeable character like Dave and write him in such a way that makes readers empathise with him, no matter what his actions are. William Meikle is a talented man indeed. He writes incredibly engaging characters, as seen in this novella.Dave and his friends ask the universe for something they really want and it's not long before the universe responds and neither Dave nor his friends are safe.I liked the style of telling this story which sees Dave retelling the last few weeks to a policeman as he's being questioned. This broke the story up without ruining the flow of it. The conclusion was as it should have been but the romantic theme being explored more at the end I felt was unnecessary.Recommended."
"02 25, 2013",B00B0YGBVC,5.0,Even Better Than The First Book,A30ZXHR9EP4YUC,"A great sequel to Haunted House For Sale .  Normally the second book is never as good as the first, but in this instance it was even better.  Great paranormal romance complete with a cast of unforgettable spirits...and not the bottled kind.  Oh, and by the way all of you worrying about the grammar, amount of commas and other nonsense...try reading this book for the pure pleasure of enjoying a very good book...you might actually enjoy it.  Thanks for another great book."

"01 27, 2013",B00B3CUSQU,5.0,Great action and an interesting world intersect with wonderful characters for the win!,A3TP31S61PPE3G,I really liked the first one but this one ROCKED. Some of the tightest writing I've read in quite some time for a MM anchors this one. Love Liam and Daniel and they are just perfect together. They have that ambiance that makes you feel comfortable with them - they belong together. There is some humor as well - not enough to kill the kick ass suspense type mood but just here and there to ease the tension. The world is very well built and you get a great picture of it in your head. The action is practically non stop and I quite literally did not put this down at all - not even for a bathroom break! Very highly recommended!
"05 13, 2014",B00B3MSD2G,5.0,I enjoyed the twists in this story.,A23DF50ADBHHWX,"This is the second book of Sicily Yoder's I have read. I enjoyed the storyline. It had twists and turns which I wasn't expecting. I knew going into reading this book that other volumes followed it, so to get the whole picture I will purchase the other parts of the story. Yet, with what Ms. Yoder provides here it was enough to keep me turning the pages and I let out a gasp at the end."

"04 11, 2014",B00B4H3E60,1.0,A poor showing,A3UEXFWSF3R2F8,"I picked up a copy of this work free from the BookBub newsletter. I'm constantly on the lookout for other works of real science fiction out there in eBook land and thought I might have found one in Star Chase. I was wrong. The writing is sophomoric, the characters lack depth, the plot (such as it is) is by turns uninteresting and unbelievable. The &#34;science&#34; is also bizarre. The intro was OK, giving an explanation of how humanity found FTL travel and our spread throughout the arm of the galaxy. Unfortunately, Mr. Saxon took Arthur C. Clarke's dictum regarding advanced technology and magic far to seriously. It is simply a grab bag of cliched SF devices with no attempt at making sense of the mishmash on offer. The dialog is insipid and a lot of the action happens off page. I feel cheated and I got the book for free, I would be incensed if I had paid $4.50 for it."
"08 9, 2013",B00B4IDXLU,4.0,Smaratest Horse,ANYFFX3SIZ57U,I really enjoyed reading this book - it seemed that with every few days there was a new situationthat kept me guessing.  I really enjoyed reading it.

Zak is malnourished, drinks as much as he can, takes whatever drugs he can find, and hates himself and everyone else. And Logan, while more controlled, is probably just as angry at everyone. Neither character is emotionally attractive, and Zak certainly is not described as physically attractive so I did not understand the why, when the sexual tension started. It made no sense. I made it to the 50% mark and the story was still not convincing.  This should be listed as a fantasy."

"03 3, 2013",B00B59AAQE,2.0,"Abuse is not sexy, cute, hot or erotic!",A126LCW1GHP71V,"First, I want to explain my two stars, because I feel like I'm being way too generous. I'm giving 2 stars only because the beginning was good and the cover is nice. At the same time, the cover is very misleading and way to vanilla for this type of story.I thought the story is going to be about tortured hero. It kind of was, but I didn't expected for the story to take a turn to the crazy-town. I was keep hoping that Nathan will snap out of it, but he never did. It got worse with every page.Without further ado, here are some of the things that pissed me off, because I could not understand what author was trying to accomplish by creating such characters:- WARNING SLIGHT SPOILERS -&#34;Nathan Rafferty really was a thug from the wrong side of town. A man who'd rather beat her than love her. Maybe then, he could get her out of his head and get his life back on track.&#34;***He said this after he broke in into her house. She found him sitting in the dark.&#34;There is something about surprising someone.&#34; He stretched out his legs and crossed his ankles. &#34;I can almost smell the fear&#34; he inhaled &#34;and feel your heart hammering inside your chest from clear across the room.&#34;***His head lowered and he spoke into her ear. &#34;Try to play me, doll,&#34; he whispered. &#34;You want to know the real Nathan, I'll show you. You want to speed things up and take what I need instead of pussy footing around with what I was giving to you. I'll give it all to you.&#34;And I know that that can sound hot, but it wasn't, because at that point she was scared out of her mind.***&#34;I will die trying to get inside your head. You can't run from me. What you think, feel, fear, is now mine. I will know every secret you've buried and every worry you've fed and nurtured by yourself. You think I'm scary now, just know that I can make you or break you.&#34;***Then he was going to beat her to forget what seeing her here did to him.***&#34;If I ever catch you talking, walking, looking at the people on the street, I will beat you until you're too sore to walk out the door.&#34;***His euphoria came from watching someone plead. He lived off delivering pain.I get it, there are some people that get off on that. I don't know much about it, but as long as it's consensual, who cares and who am I to judge anyway. The scary part about it was that he wasn't kidding about it. He wasn't talking about inflicting some mild pain, he was talking about seeing a woman in agony and completely broken both emotionally and physically.Heroine - I dont know what she is about. She owns a company called Carpool Dolls. For the life of me I could not understand what she did for a living. It's not an escort service, even though it sounded like it at first. They help men to get from point A to point B (???). I didn't get it.You get the impression that she is with him willingly, but then again, she cries a lot, most of the time is confused and scared.&#34;If she would stayed in his house. If she followed his commands. If she allowed herself to love him, she'd lose herself in the process, and she feared if she let him have everything from her, she'd never survive.&#34;I'm not even sure what that means. But it doesn't sound right.It felt like the whole book was translated from some foreign language using a google translate. Writing wasn't good, at all. It must be bad when someone like me notice it, because I'm not an expert on a subject matter.Weird, infuriating and confusing story."

And Sara Celi did not disappoint!Charlotte's life is pretty bleak. Her mom is an alcoholic who spends all of her day drowning her sorrows. It doesn't help that everyone knows that her mother used to be a stripper and a good one at that.She's noticed Fostino always seems to be looking her way. Yet he hasn't said anything but &#34;hello&#34; or &#34;hi&#34; to her in passing, but change is coming. One night while she sneaks out to the field by her house Fostino finds her. He's part of the The Party as a guard. He was on patrol and came across Charlotte laying there looking up at the stairs. He warns her of the changes coming up. From there life isn't the same anymore.Fostino and Charlotte see each other when they can, but each days seems to bring them closer and closer to death. The way The Party has taken over their town, killed innocent people because they claim they are &#34;undesirables&#34;, and made them work in the shirt factory all day.Charlotte realizes she doesn't want to be there anymore. She needs to escape, but Fostino won't listen to her. Then she finds out some information that turns her world upside down. She has to get out before trouble finds her. With the help of her new friends she sets out on an adventure she never knew she was strong enough or capable of doing. And she plans on rescuing Fostino as well.This book was suspenseful! I loved the adrenaline rush I got just reading this. There is nothing like chanting &#34;GO GO GO GO&#34; in your head as you hope that the main character gets away from the bad guys. I loved this book and cannot wait to read the second one in this series when it comes out!"
"09 4, 2013",B00B6JFKNG,5.0,Racing heart,A3NOFJSTRLQHX5,OMG! I am truly enjoying this book series. It has an wonderful storyline and I cannot wait to start the next book of this series. Would definitely recommend reading this book series to anyone who enjoys reading.
"02 22, 2013",B00B6L2Q4K,5.0,Great vocaulary builder,AI31Y8JXTJPE9,"This book is as described and includes 30 words that begin with the letter A. Each word comes with an illustration that visually represents the word. The 3d illustrations are cute and there are many words will challenge a child that is learning to read.The words include obkects, actions and concepts.You can then explain the word in more detail to your child. Great to expand your child's vocabulary. A good buy for kids starting reading lessons."

"05 26, 2013",B00B8S5F2G,4.0,Short & Sexy,A3HY7DE45OAY0G,"This is a short story about Chloe who has the hots for her brother's best friend Graves. She has been coming onto him for a year and at first she thought he seemed interested but lately he won't even look at her. What she doesn't realise is that Graves is in love with her but due to his upbringing and how he likes to have sex, he doesn't think he's the right man for her.As Chloe's 25th birthday is approaching and she is still a virgin she comes on strong to Graves asking him to take her virginity but he turns her down. Making him jealous by saying she will give her virigintiy to Luke, another friend of her brothers, Graves gives in and they spend the night together.This author writes very good sex scenes. I really liked Graves. His upbringing and his initation into sex has left him emotionless. He doesn't kiss women and he never lets them touch him but when he sleeps with Chloe, his walls come tumbling down.This is a good sexy story. The next book is about manwhore Luke! I look forward to reading of his downfall!"

"12 20, 2013",B00BAXFGUK,3.0,The Seamy Side of Life In the Early 20th Century,A1360RQIC7SIMY,"Disclosure: E-Galley provided by Publisher via NetGalley for review on my blog from which this is excerpted and edited. No remuneration was exchanged and all opinion presented herein is my own except as noted.The cover and story remind me a little of &#34;Girl with a Pearl Earring,&#34; but the execution of the story is not as well done.One thing I liked about this book was how the Sophie&#8217;s (the main female character) voice changes as she matures. I also like how the relationship between the &#8220;hero.&#8221; Ash and Sophie develops right before the end.Even so, Sophie, a poor, 13 year-old sent to the big house to go into service when she is left alone in the world. But the drawing of Sophie&#8217;s character doesn&#8217;t really fit the character as far as social status and education. The characters are just sketches.If you&#8217;s watched much Masterpiece theater or Agatha Christie style murder mysteries you&#8217;ve seen everyone in this book.Just about every plot device that&#8217;s been paraded out the past couple of years is found in this book. Some are combined with different characters than the Downton Abbey plots of the past few years but they&#8217;re all there: dead heirs, marrying for money, creepy footmen, philandering counts humping the help, rich men corrupting naive women.It is true that all the themes used: sweeping change, new freedoms, horrible losses in the first modern war, modernizations, the rise of the middle class, jazz: all those things were happening. There&#8217;s a reason they say it&#8217;s great for fans of Downton AND Fifty Shades.  There is one thing I had not personally read lately: corruption of the simple, innocent maid by the naughty young widow &#8212; a little f/f experimentation.I&#8217;d like to say it&#8217;s about Sophie&#8217;s coming of age, her sacrifices, or even about what she reads in the books she &#8220;borrows&#8221; from the Duke&#8217;s library. She goes from a country scullery maid to a sophisticated jazz baby in two shakes of a lamb&#8217;s tail.  I thought the story detailed  the seamy, seedy nature of all but a couple characters. And, that bugged me and made the read unpleasant for me. Even the main character, essentially good, is without enough moral fortitude and ultimately falls. About the only nice female is the housekeeper. Every where Sophie turns is like a pit of snakes.There&#8217;s a lot of intimacy, but while it&#8217;s hot and dirty stuff  in the end it just gets sort of boring.But in the end, I had to force myself to read the book. Just not my cup of tea."
"07 14, 2014",B00BAYLXZ6,5.0,Curvy Girls...sweet,A3HEG0QCOK446R,LOL...wow!  I really loved this book!  Of course Georgette knows how to write and love her style.  Funny books full of romance and sensuality!  Loved this.  Of course I have all her stuff too!

"07 20, 2014",B00BC24MF4,4.0,A Nearly Perfect Conclusion to the Series,AHCAJ2JZRAYD9,"What a wonderful conclusion to the series by Joey W Hill! This has been a wondrous journey of learning & understanding, as the main character reaches new clarity regarding her deceased sister. Her journey of sexual understanding and exploration reaches new heights as well. The people she meets and interacts with are fully-realized, three dimensional characters, and the story is filled with genuine emotions, as well as really hot sex.The only reason I have left off one star, is due to the shortness of the story. I wish dearly that there had been more!"
"11 4, 2013",B00BCBMTGE,1.0,If I could give it a -5 I would have.,A1KRYEH6EDGQ6E,"I could not read the entire book. I'm sorry, I try to be fair but I cannot see how ANYONE in their right mind could give this book a 5, 4 or even a 3. I paid for the darn book based on reviews. These reviews have to be from family and friends of the author. I really wish I could get my money back. It was as if I were reading some teenager's diary. Not sure how to describe the immature writing skills. The story might (big questionable might) have had a good storyline if it wasn't for how this writer just dragged on and on on every single detail. For example, Mason taking a shower and every single detail about the towel and such.... really? It was a detailed description of EVERY SINGLE thought. I wanted to pull my hair out! The entire story was lame. This author needs a better editor if she has one at all. I'm sorry to say but don't spend the money. I could not even finish the story."

"02 16, 2013",B00BCFYO8G,3.0,Cute storyline but I wanted a little more,A1PNUOUUJ6AGUJ,"A Little Bit Cupid is a very adorable Valentine's short story. Cosmo, Cupid's son, needs Phoebe's help to save the world of love and happy endings. She needs to find her soul-mate and kiss him before Valentine's Day to make everything normal. Sounds crazy, right? I read it within an hour and despite the story being very rushed, I enjoyed the overall concept. I would have loved to read a full length novel about it with more details.Pheobe is a well established photographer and when Cosmo shows up with his outrageous story and a hand picked soul mate for her, Pheobe is left with no choice but to follow through with the plan. Along the way, instead for falling for Supposedly-The-One Adam, she falls for his room-mate Cam. I liked that Adam was a very calm & composed person, and I absolutely loved that Cam wasn't uptight because to his job like I would have expected, he was more playful & flirtatious. I liked both guys, but I couldn't get a good handle on Pheobe. Just because she was put in an unreal situation and acted on stop, I felt like I never got a chance to know more about her outside of photography.As a novella, A Little Bit Cupid is a well written story. It was clean, quick and funny. If you are looking for a under an hour romantic read, then A Little Bit Cupid by Jennifer Shirk is a perfect choice."
"06 22, 2014",B00BCG1N16,3.0,Cute story,A1RVTF261ZMY4M,I really enjoyed this book. I think that it could have been better. it's a great love story but it was missing something for me. the love was not enough and I wish it could have been a little more wilder.

So much so that I must check Amazon 3-4 times a week hoping for the next installment!It was fun getting to know Sassafras' sister a little more. And to see his Dad's emotion. Meems is taking a stronger role in the books, and it's part of the lure wondering how she will grow and change.

The sex is a bit graphic for my tastes but does not detract from the plot, that is, doesn't take up too much of the plot. I enjoyed both parts but the second book was slightly better thatn the first. Although the books are related they could easily stand alone, that is, you could read one or the other and not lose anything. If you like romance novels this is good reading."

"08 18, 2013",B00BE2LNW2,4.0,Good new vampire series,ADDT2MU773IYL,"""The Girl From Yesterday"" by David L. Dawson is a cleverly set up first book in a series.In it a woman is 'un-frozen' to a world that has been taken over by vampires and humans, just like herself, are kept as slaves.Her main conflict arises from the romantic notion she has about vampires from a novel she once read, and the fact that the beautiful Jensen, her vampire master, is just like she had imagined the hero of her book.This is a well written beginning of the series but because of some sort of cliff hanger cannot be seen as a stand alone work of fiction. Since the book was free when I bought it I am not complaining but simply pointing out that you may find yourself back in the shop looking for the sequel.A recommendation for all fans of the Vampire genre."

The dialogue seemed off, and I wasn't sure about the characters - especially Merian.  She was hard to understand at first.  Seemed a little one-dimensional for a while.  Despite that, I decided to keep reading.  Mostly because of Aia, her story helped keep me interested.There are editing issues - another thing about this story that made it hard for me to get into it.  Some parts felt like there were things missing, which would make it hard for me to get into it because I was trying to figure out what was going on.I did really enjoy the romance of this story, especially how it didn't distract from everything else going on.  It made it feel more realistic.All and all, I did really enjoy the story and I would be interested in reading more.  I recommend it to people who enjoy YA fantasy.3/5 platypires"

"06 19, 2014",B00BFL9B58,4.0,"Wonderfully written, great storyteller.",A23FCS6BISQD0N,"Let's get this out of the way right now: the lack of quotation marks is on purpose. Many negative reviews focus on this as some sort of horrendous grammatical error. By deliberately choosing to write dialog this way, the author creates a different tone and feel in the characters. It might take getting used to, but it is effective.The story consists of numerous story arcs which cover over a hundred years. Many characters appear for only a chapter, others more. While at first, the reader wonders what happened to them, but every chapter manages to pull the reader deeper into the overall story. The author is a gifted storyteller who manages to change between a large variety of characters,  including their backstories and how they add to our present story.Some aspects of the story I felt were underdeveloped (what about the Soma cure? What happened with the revolution?), but some tory elements need to be left to the readers' imaginations. Also, as a general rule, I truly dislike serialized novels, as frequently it ends up as a gimmick to sell more books. That's not the case here, but I would have appreciated a bit more closure (if not answers).As a whole, I loved the book. Excellent writing and a rich tapestry of characters combine to tell the story of not individuals, but the race of humans. In the end, it is humankind that tells the story, not just the individuals. That's why there are no quotation marks."
"09 14, 2013",B00BFLJWBG,2.0,an interesting take on beauty and the beast,A37GH49W6GKHQ7,"I would have given 3 stars but there were too many unnecessary typos. It was rather an intense book (because it was all about her sufferings and curiosity etc,)with lots of peripheral characters who had little depth. And I was disappointed with the abruptness of some scenes that we were led to believe were important. The garden scene was so rushed one hardly realised it had happened.It was indeed important to the plot yet very rushed.But I did find the book quite an interesting light read.Not for young teens, though I don't think it is aimed at them. The end was a bit sudden but all's well that ends well!"
"06 3, 2013",B00BFMDY0A,2.0,Disappointed,A2XLJCVDWMQYFM,"I almost gave up on this one during the first couple of chapters but slogged through and finished it. Weird premise, lots of grammatical and spelling errors (my pet peeve - don't these authors have an editor?)that seem to be too common in Kindle books. Beware the electrical outlet, you never know who's going to pop out."
"07 7, 2014",B00BFQ7C0E,4.0,Still smiling,A24OB0Y1OJ3A03,I always love it when I can find a beautifully written contemporary romance that isn't sexually explicit. I thought Dani and Wes were charming. I found myself smiling over and over again. I would definitely recommend to others!

"03 13, 2014",B00BGHSW4W,3.0,Disappointed,ASJIRZD9XS260,This book started off good and had my interest but it was extremely short. I'm not sure if this was meant as an incentive to buy the next one but it only turned me off and made me uninterested in purchasing anything else by this author. I have read 5 star books for free and I would rather pay $10 and receive a REAL book.
"05 12, 2013",B00BGLARX2,3.0,Hmmm? April in OR,A2TDCK02CMWWAR,"Not sure about this one...this is my first time reading this writers ebook and this was a different style of wolve folklore. The story starts off right away with Ming finding Jason and both of them being chased by the others in her pack because of the rule the leader made that all females must mate even against their will. Turns out the pack leader is Mings brother Rong and he was the bad guy, since they are twins they are able to read each others mind and you also learn that Ming can talk to other animals (not weres but real animals, kind of like Dr. Doolootle.)This was a little confusing at times, Jason was still in jail but Ming was able to bring him into a sort of dream/real realm and it was hard to keep track. Ming needed Jason to confess his love for her so that she didn't have to moon mate with others...I wish the writer spent more time with Mings and Jason story because it felt rushed and it was sort of believable and the ending felt rushed to, most of the story was about them being chased and than getting caught and lastly winning their battle.*Spoiler* One more thing that got me was that when Jason turned he ate one of the prison guards...see for me this was a totally different story of wolves. Sooo...you'll either like or hate this ebook..it was in the middle for me."

The Cougar Diaries Part 1 is a story of redemption, fun, emotion and a lot of very explicit and arousing sex.I can't read a story if I don't like the characters. In The Cougar Diaries we meet Aoife who is separated and then divorced (thankfully from her selfish ex husband). She is vulnerable but helped by her friend Trish she dips her toe into dating again. She dips a lot more than her toes and experiences everything a woman might desire from young studs to erotic massage and all places in between. I liked Aoife a lot.It's a great read and unreservedly recommended."

What I'm upset about and what I am getting so tired of are these ebooks that end part way through. Please stop publishing only parts of a book. If you don't have enough written, then wait until it's finished before publishing.You are losing customers.

As she leaves the situation, she finds herself thinking more and more about him.

And with the help of a mentor and a lot of cash, Liv's dream of owning a bakery is finally coming to fruition. After working her way successfully through the ranks of her mentor's bakery and being a part-time bartender, Liv is ready to branch out on her own. The pressure is on to make her sweet treats the best, but with supportive friends surrounding her, Liv is ready for the challenge. What Liv hadn't anticipated was to get involved in a different kind of venture altogether - a more personal one. Just as her business is about to open its doors, the man of her dreams steps in and refuses to let her hesitancy sway him. He's everything Liv never thought she was missing in her life and for the first time ever she is contemplating letting another man into her heart. And just when Liv thought she was safe to give in to that temptation, the sweet smell of personal and professional success quickly turns sour. Now she must decide if any of it is worth picking up the pieces.""For the love of all cupcakes, please don't let this man take my heart.""Jake is on the hunt for a prestigious promotion and nothing and no one is going to get in his way, but he didn't count on a sweet smelling slip of a woman to be his downfall. If only she wasn't the ""mission"" his boss wanted him to complete in order to land the job, then falling into bed with her wouldn't be a problem. Just when Jake thinks things can't get anymore complicated, the ""spark"" his grandfather told him about is exactly what he finds with Liv. The woman of his dreams just couldn't have come into his life at a worse time or under worse circumstances. The more Jake gets to know Liv, the worse the temptation becomes to give in to the chemistry between them, but the lies are mounting. Now Jake has to figure out a way of how to have his cake and eat it too before it's too late.Deception, sex, cupcakes, and chemistry - quite an intriguing combination and wow did it work for this story! Between the underlying saboteur plotline, the effects of a deadbeat dad, a misunderstood womanizer, and getting all hot and bothered by Jake and Liv's sexually charged encounters, the pages just seem to fly while reading. Add in a humorous group of friends and many delicious references to cupcakes with a naughty tip on how to use frosting for things other than just eating it and you have the recipe for a fantastic read!It was refreshing to read a male lead that is sweet and romantic instead overbearing and extremely alpha, which seems to be all the craze these days. This is not to say Jake's character isn't instinctive in both protection and possession of Liv and he takes care to prove it throughout the story. And I liked that the lust wasn't immediately acted upon, so the buildup was that much more for when it finally happened. Both characters are likable and possess a depth that is nicely drawn out in the story. The road to Jake and Liv's HEA is definitely not a cakewalk, but neither is it as confrontational as I would have expected. A couple events left me wanting a bit more after all was revealed. It just seemed to be that the people involved got off a little too easy. Aside from that, I thoroughly enjoyed getting to know the two main characters and their eccentric friends and wouldn't mind stories on them.In the mood for a scrumptious read with just A Taste of Trouble? Then this one's for you! But beware you may experience a craving for cupcakes (among other things) while enjoying this story."

"03 1, 2013",B00BMRTDPS,5.0,Best of the Series!,A2T2K889M47P8Q,"I think that as this Nick Bracco series continues, it get's better and better!  Each installment in this series becomes more intriguing, suspenseful, and AWESOME!  I seem to use that word (awesome) a lot when describing Gary Ponzo's writing.  He has a way of drawing the reader into the story and allowing them to connect with the characters.  We are there, in the jungle forests of the world in which Ponzo creates.  The connection goes much further than a desire for Nick and his team to succeed in their pursuit of justice, we want to be there, right there in the fictional world with Nick, Matt, and (no spoilers here) the other characters, to help them in their ventures.  Thank you Gary Ponzo for bringing us the Nick Bracco thrillers!"

"04 19, 2013",B00BOVL2CE,5.0,Captured Me!,A1D28I3W5CMG6P,"""I never thought I'd say this, but I enjoy this. You might be in trouble.""Wow, okay. So that was intense. I had to take a few days to process before writing this review.This was definitely one of those books that you cannot put down once you get into it. The beginning took a bit of developing before it got intense, but that made sense because Klaus, the hero of the story, took some time getting into the swing of things. He was dragged into this capture fantasy venture by Jodie, just about kicking and screaming. It took him some time to switch gears. But once he switched gears, ladies, the gloves came off and so did the panties (and the laundry did not get done... why does that sound so dirty? you know, what I meant, right? that I couldn't put the book down? yeah? okay, I know it gets ruined when I have to explain the punch line. blah blah blah).""My libido was sitting up and panting with its ass in the air."" (see, that's what I meant)So the concept was a capture fantasy for a documentary Jodie was hoping to make. It was kind of a backward capture fantasy. It all started out so civilized. Usually capture fantasies start out with non consent, mystery, and fear that evolve into trust and maybe affection as we get to know the characters. This goes the other way. We started out with trust and progressed to uncertainty and fear.""This was like chess with her mind, and the wrong move on her part meant I got to do things I could never do out there in the normal world.""It was so unexpected, but Klaus was HOT. I love a dominant man. I do. But when you pair dominant with deviant sadist... I can't resist. It's probably the hottest combination ever. AND factor in the hot judo moves. We didn't stand a chance, ladies. Well, I didn't stand a chance and neither did Jodie.""When the going gets tough the tough get kinky.""Okay, let's address the basics - the writing was great. The storyline was well developed and flowed smoothly. Well, as smoothly as a mind f*** is supposed to flow. There were definitely moments where I wondered who was being mind f***ed, Jodie, Klaus or me? ... The BDSM was creative, realistic and (again) well written. There was a whole lot of sexy here and a whole lot of kinky. Mind f***? Check. Sadomasochism? Check. Menage? Check. Girl on girl? Check. Needles? Yes, please. I mean... check.On a serious note, I want to say that reading Cari Silverwood's BDSM is always refreshing because she always mentions safety, proper research, practice, mentorship options, importance of community support... Her characters are not perfect and sometimes make mistakes, because there's a self discovery and learning phase. But they're self aware, questioning, learning. It makes the whole situation feel more authentic.I really enjoyed Klaus and Jodie's story. Klaus might have started off reluctant, but once he discovered that there's a part of him that enjoys kink it all came naturally to him. Like the flood gates opened up and he stepped into his real persona. Jodie also uncovered a new world and found that what she once thought was degrading just might be empowering. It was a backwards love story. Unexpected and suspenseful, yet fulfilling. I can't wait to see what Cari Silverwood has in store for Klaus and Jodie in the sequel."
"02 14, 2014",B00BP5DNTE,4.0,A light short read,A30QQBCVRV75HZ,"I wavered between giving the book 3 stars or 4 stars...Lacey remodels an old farmhouse and turns it into a bed and breakfast inn. The first night she's open for business a man is discovered at the bottom of the stairs with a railroad spike sticking out of his chest. Who is he and who killed him at her new inn? It turns out he's the husband of one of her guests, but the man had died 7 years earlier.The book has promise. A mystery at an inn. A romantic attraction between the innkeeper and the detective. A pretty location. Likeable characters. The author couldn't quite get the storyline under control but I think if she'd had a good editor this book would have been a page turner. The obvious problems were stilted dialogue, abrupt point of view changes, no red herrings, and juvenile scenes. Also couldn't get a handle on &#34;show don't tell&#34;. There's too many editors out there who just do a read through instead of taking a good story and making it a great story and unfortunately this author used an inexperienced editor.It was easy to read, no major spelling or formatting issues. For a free short story its an enjoyable read."

"06 20, 2013",B00BQ6SDLK,4.0,"Good story, poor proofreading",AC2G4C3TDPH49,"I was given this book by the author in exchange for a fair and honest review.Hannah Bieler has married and her siblings are looking toward their marriage prospects in Chasing Heaven Amish Romance Boxed Set by Becca Fisher.  Each sibling has problems in their love lives.  Grace is picky and refuses an arranged marriage.  Elizabeth thought she had her man when he finally admits he found someone else.  Clara is not sure she wants to stay in the community or leave for the English world.  William is looking at Englisher girls but is searching for who he is and what he wants.This is a four story set consisting of Chasing Heaven, Lord Willing, Waiting on a Prayer, and Leap of Faith.  Each story picks up where the last left off. They need to be read in order.I liked the characters.  I also enjoyed how the story was done in vignettes with one the Bieler family as the focus of the vignette.  I liked knowing the thoughts of each person as they went through their lives trying to discover love and the right way for him/herself.  It was not easy.  I particularly enjoyed that the parents and grandparents were included in the story and the vignettes.  I especially liked Mariam and Daniel Bieler, the parents who let their love for each other show while worrying about their children and Mariam's parents.  That was a nice touch.On the down side was the lack of proofreading.  There was a loss of continuity of ages and names that pulled me out of the story often.  That is regrettable as Chasing Heaven Amish Romance Boxed Set is a good read with good, realistic characters.  They deserve better."

The book follows Melanie, a thirty-something Texas debutante who has all the trappings of success in New York through her personal ""aha"" moment. The story opens with her inviting movers into her home to relocate her from a bad marriage as stealthily as they can. As the three apply their muscle to packing up her belongings, Melanie unpacks the baggage of all that has transpired to get her to that place.The story is all at once funny, dramatic, sad and everything in between as we relive Melanie's life from Texas, Monte Carlo, Manhattan, Newport, and Palm Beach, where she faces destructive love affairs, financial trouble, family issues, unplanned pregnancy, and more of the same with her sister and her friends.  Her father, Oldie, is a figure who could be compared to the Rock Hudson character in the classic movie, Giant, and her mother the Elizabeth Taylor character. Her parents raise her as they were before her, as spoiled children of entitlement who have to learn to separate reality from the trappings of privilege to which they have grown accustomed. Melanie suffers a lot of the same trials and tribulations as women of lesser means, despite having been born with the proverbial silver spoon in her mouth.With a surprising and unprecedented opportunity to have lasting love with the most unlikely person, will Melanie squander it on principal or will she experience the epiphany she needs to free herself from being ""stuck on stupid,"" or will she remain ""stupid by choice?""

"08 10, 2013",B00BR8KHUW,3.0,An interesting story,A39070TA5C1GJD,"Jake is just an ordinary boy who wants to be liked.This sentence sums up Jake pretty well.  The story of Jake is the story of a pretty ordinary teenage boy going through his ordinary day to day life.  I think that is what makes this book interesting, the fact that Jake is just like the kid next door...or just like you.  He has a good home, a nice life, and satisfying friendships.  He is not some secret superpower waiting to be discovered - he's just Jake.The characters are well written and believable.  Jake's little brother Ben is cute.  I think it is hard to write kids and make them credible, but the author is able to do it here.Overall I enjoyed this story, though it was a bit depressing.  I guess life is sometimes, though.  The beginning was a bit slow for me, but as Jake's story continued things and people's lives started weaving together and created an interesting narrative."

Of course, Steve writes good books and he doesn't use filler content like many other authors in this niche, but the (only) major strategy he recommends in this book is to write more books, in the same niche.There is an obvious issue if an author writes one book every 3 weeks in the same niche (as suggested in this book) - The quality will suffer.It took 3 months for me to write my first book and it will take 4-5 months to write my next book (estimated time). Just write, not formatting, book-cover, publishing, etc. One of the reasons for it is the amount of research required to write each sub-topic within these books.Secondly, these two books will be in different niches because in my first book I covered almost everything that I want to convey about that topic - IMO, a book is complete only when an author can say that confidently.This book is a good choice if you intend to write many books within the same niche. But for people like me who (plan to) write two quality books in a year, there is nothing much. At least nothing much that we already don't know."

"11 6, 2013",B00BT1DZVK,5.0,Fast zombies & Real Military,A4XLW2LFW5PZI,"""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" is a very enjoyable addition to the zombie universe of books. This one was especially fun since it had such a realistic feel on the battlefield with an isolated military convoy in Afghanistan. The writing was clean and sharp and the current military tone to everything was sketched perfectly. I found the characters to be believable and attractive and their situation compelling. Finally, we have realistic zombies that are fast and creepy and that have a (somewhat) believable first cause. I was hooked from the get go and happily rode right beside the forgotten team of military specialists page after page.The text had a few typos and grammar issues but surprisingly few, really. The dialogue was good, the radio chatter apt, their decision making reasonable, and the growing realization of the extent of their isolation and the world's ultimately dire situation was terrific.I highly recommend this book. I am already happily plowing through the next volume in the story and I can assure you that it continues on in the same highly entertaining fashion. Great job Mr. Lundy! Keep writing."

Very simple and retro. Fits this book well.Summary: Teal County. The populace would say it's a prime community of modern sophistication and wealth, filled with every form of entertaining consumption one could desire. Expenses were not spared in producing this lavish and clean looking suburb, along with creating an effective and expanded judicial and policing system and a wide and over reaching corporate industry.But not everyone finds Teal County to be so fantastic. A young man by the name of Nathan Grant, who has a bitter love-hate relationship with the County he was raised in, is heading back after a long absence in hopes of finishing one last job, part of which includes transporting a very valuable item. The crudeness of the County officials had ironically been both the inspiration for his plans, and now was an abrupt interruption to them, as his freedom in the County is cut short just as soon as he arrives. From there, the story's woven tapestries begins to unravel, and we find foes of Nathan with a set of their own agendas in mind, as well as friends willing to help. With the aid of his friends, Emily, a highly attractive party going drug user, and Aiden, a capable well to do computer genius, among others, Nathan must prevail through the hurdles made by County authorities that stand in his way as he tries to complete a task for Martin Benson, a sleazy corporate high roller. Little does Benson know, Nathan has a few alternative plans of his own for Benson, and little does Nathan know, he might be getting into more hot water than he bargained for. After it is revealed Benson has ties with Falco Dietrich, a German terrorist, along with a handful of his cohorts, and it would also seem the highly effective FBI team of Agent's Simms and Harris has secretly had an eye on Benson for quite some time, several culminating moments of action and deceptions determine the fates of these characters. All while in the midst of negotiating through the complexities of the modern suburb of Teal County.But even when cornered, Nathan proves his wide knowledge of the town he grew up in can give him a tricky advantage, and that he may have more than one motive for why he chose to target Benson in his plansMy Thoughts: For a thriller its a very interesting tale with characters that you get attached to and ending to beat the band. At times it did lose me because I was simply stumped and had to re-read a few previous pages. Great amount of imaginable details and a hook for sure that will keep the reader coming back to find out what is going down. Good Read.Rating: 4 out of 5 stars"

"04 19, 2013",B00BY5QXDS,4.0,Who doesn't love a tortured hero in love?,A1KP3KUQ9FXYPJ,"Ian didn't want a Welcome Home party. He wasn't ready and he didn't know half the people in the club anyway. After 10 years active duty, there are things you can't unsee. And those things mess with a man. But, as he fled the scene, he bumped into a miracle on legs (sexy ones at that.) The woman he ran into and subsequently patched up had a unique talent - she brought him peace. A simple touch could calm his anxiety like nothing before.  He knew she was special and he had to keep her in his arms longer. A one night stand is a good start...The strange but beautiful man that ran Roxanne over and proceeded to bandage her scrape, lit her on fire like never before. He made her feel things she never thought she would.  He made her want. Best thing to do for a commitment-phobe like herself? Get him out of her system. All she needed was just one night. Love would only lead to pain and hatred anyway, but lust on the other hand was fun. And her plan was working magically...until he said his name and she realized that she was in bed with her best friend's older brother.Ian and Roxanne had a LOT of growing to do. They both had inner demons to fight: his, a product of war and hers, a product of a very selfish and unhappy mother. Even though Ian was dealing with ""almost PTSD"" (even though I'm not sure that you can almost have something like that) he came around to the idea of he and Roxanne a lot quicker than she did. She did her best to push him away, convinced that it would only lead to tears and heartbreak. He seduced her into spending more time with him and then won her heart by opening up, trusting her, and needing her. It was hard at times to watch someone push the best thing in their life away so fervently, but I was also glad that they didn't get over such huge fears so quickly either. I think the ""I love you"" came a bit too quickly, but it certainly wasn't easily which made up for part of it. Still, through all the misunderstandings, Ian and Roxanne are a couple you root for and pray they see the light, so they can be the gooey happy couple hiding in the corner pawing at each other at parties.This was a good follow up to the first book in Ms. Robert's series, Wrong Bed, Right Guy. I really enjoyed visiting with our first couple since Ian is Elle's brother, we get a glimpse life after their ""HEA"". These stories are solidly entertaining reads, very spicy, and my favorite part - the MAN chases the WOMAN! Pretty refreshing change of roles in romance.  I love that she tells us that not all men are afraid of commitment, nor are all women ready to hop into marriage at every turn! I'll definitely be tuning in for the next chapter to see who Nathan (also introduced in Book 1) is bringing to Elle's wedding!Rating: BThis review & more at Red Hot Books!"

"06 10, 2013",B00BZPJT6A,4.0,Good read,A1O5HN9H4VYEU0,"I received this as an ARC not knowing it was part of a series, so while it can stand alone, I wouldn't suggest it as there are parts in the book that make it clear there is history that would be helpful to know. That being said, this book was very enjoyable. The dialogue was great and the story was rather intense in some parts. I liked that I wasn't able to completely figure out what was going to happen, but I was a bit disappointed by how quickly the main characters got involved and how trusting she was of him from the get go. It just felt a little rushed getting them together and left me wanting a little more build up and chracter development."
"04 28, 2013",B00BZTOP0G,5.0,A REAL GEM,A3U41P3MHAEXYU,"Set in the Great Depression era of the thirties in the US this is the story of Trey McCade a farmer from Virgina, and Genevieve Kelly who is living in a shanty town in New York. When Genevieve's father dies leaving her alone, the local priest tells her of Trey who's a farmer in Virginia looking for a wife. Trey has lost his wife and parents in a very short span of time..Trey and Genevieve exchange letters, he's looking for an ugly wife, Genevieve who's taller than average with bright red hair, considers herself very plain, and feels that she fits Trey's requirements. For his part Trey is offering a safe and secure home.When Genevieve arrives in Virginia, she is confronted by Trey who at around 6' 7&#34; is a giant of a man. He towers over Genevieve's 5' 7&#34;. His first words to her are &#34;your not ugly, but I'll guess you'll do&#34; made me laugh.I have read numerous mail order bride stories before, but nothing quite as good as this. Trey McCade is gruff, speaks his mind, expects to be obeyed immediately, and has a jealous streak a mile wide. He's all alpha. Fans of Linda Chance's heroes will love this guy. But we soon learn his bark is worse thn his bite. Genevieve is by turn feisty and submissive, she's so grateful to Trey for literally rescuing her from her meagre existance, she tries to keep her opinions to herself. Not always very successfully. The books I've read before with this theme are pretty tame compared to this book. This is definitely what I would call spicy. With an interesting cast of side characters, especially Treys handsome brother Cole. Who I hope is getting his own tale. Make this an excellent read.Highly recommend"

I'm still optimistic that if there is a Book 2 in this series I'll get that too...  Lack o smut aside, I loved the characters!  I've read a few ghost related paranormal romances, and this one is by far the best.  Marmi is such a wonderful companion to Sophie that it made me smile every time they interacted.I'm new to this author, but if this book is any indication, I'll be picking up others."

"09 19, 2013",B00C126RFM,5.0,HOT and SEXY,A3HHCYVGF2FDYX,WOW. Loved the story loved Finn and Laci.  Short read but I enjoyed it very much. I could not put it down.
"05 12, 2013",B00C1O8CE4,4.0,Everything Advertised - and More,A2581OUK4O8NZK,"In ""Eye Candy,"" Ryan Schneider follows the philosophy/action blend of Asimovian promisory fiction; deep thoughts, interesting characters, a creative future setting, tense action. Well, maybe he doesn't push the philosophy too hard, but that's all to the better. The first part of the story tells about Dan Olivaw (Asimov fans are hearing the ""spoiler"" bells ringing), a young, handsome, rich hunk who meets Candy, a real ""keeper"", and they start a relationship which is too good to be true. The second part deals with what happens when it isn't. And that's all I'm going to give you; more would spoil the fun. The rest of the story is filled in with images of what Los Angeles might be in the 2040's, and the old question that has split the United States for a century and a half; how do we treat citizens with unequal rights?This is a book that delivers on everything promised in the title and on the cover. And a whole lot more. Its main strength is in the well-portrayed characters, even the robots, of which there are many. Especially the robots. Even the waiter-bots in the restaurants get their own quirky personalities. Future settings, both physical and social, are rendered with caring precision. Given the hints from the beginning, the whole situation is primed for irony, and tongue-in-cheek is the order of the day, especially for Asimov fans who pick up on the clues.My only problem with the story is that sometimes there is just too much.For example, there is a point in every novel just before the middle where all the characters have been introduced, where the plot is set, the conflict is established, and there is time for everyone to take a breather and enjoy the premise of the book. Sometimes this is called the ""fun and games"" section. Since this is a love story, the fun and games section is where the reader explores what it would be like to be young, good-looking, rich and in love. Private jet jaunts, steamy nights in free fall, wild restaurants, tailormade drugs, the works. However, a story can also hit a point where the fun and games has gone on for too long, and the reader starts to wonder if there is really any more to the plot, or if this is just pornography. Chapters 18 and 19, for example, could probably be removed without missing a beat of the necessary storyline. Although we'd miss some steamy bits for sure.There are also too many characters to keep them all straight, entertaining and creative though they may be. It backs the reader off from involvement in the story when you have to stop to remember who the heck so-and-so is.And there is definitely too much macho banter during the final battle scene. The author should remember that humour is one of humanity's ways of reducing conflict. While soldiers may use it this way in real-life battle, authors over-using it at intense moments in their story actually undercut the suspense.Otherwise this is a professionally written book, properly edited, and a pleasure to read. I recommend it to all SF readers, and Isaac Asimov fans especially. Hey, if you saw the ""I, Robot"" movie with Will Smith, this means you."

"05 20, 2014",B00C2RVRHE,5.0,Holy smokes!!! I'm in love.,A20Z5SSCQ90QQ6,"Reviewed for Read Your Writes Book Reviewsby KimHoly smokes!!! Those words were the first words that came to my mind as I was reading Lover Undercover.I met Samanthe Beck last year. I found her to be super funny and she left me wanting to read her books. I admit that the book that had me sold was Falling for the Marine, because I heard the opening scene was hilarious. Since the book is part of a series, I figured I would start at the beginning.I didn&#8217;t even bother to read the book description for Lover Undercover. I just one clicked it. I was really surprised. I had no idea what I was in for. It&#8217;s a Brazen book, so of course I knew there was going to be hot sex. Samanthe is funny so I expected the book to have funny moments. What I didn&#8217;t expect was the suspense of the book.Kylie Roberts and her identical twin sister Stacy grew up on the wrong side of the tracks in the small town of Two Trout, Tennessee. Kylie is the good twin who never gets into trouble. She&#8217;s reliable and is the first to think about and take care of others. Stacy is the naughty twin, whose middle name should be Trouble. Stacy truly loves her sister, but she never thinks about how her actions affect other people. Stacy&#8217;s dream was to move to Hollywood and make it big as an actress/dancer. So, Stacy and Kylie packed up Kylie&#8217;s car and moved west.For two years, Stacy has been dancing at Deuce&#8217;s and manages to take care of her and her sister. Unfortunately, one of Stacy&#8217;s clients gets a little out of hand, resulting in Stacy&#8217;s leg being broken. If Stacy doesn&#8217;t perform she will lose her job and the Roberts sisters will be forced to return to Two Trout with their tails between their legs. Stacy convinces Kylie to spend the next six weeks pretending to be her.On Kylie&#8217;s first night of dancing at Deuce&#8217;s, not only does she have to overcome her fear of dancing provocatively half naked, but she becomes mesmerized by a tall striking man in the audience. The man seems to be able to see right through to her soul. When the night is over, Kylie makes a gruesome discovery.The tall and striking man turns out to be LA Police Detective Trevor McCade. When all clues point to Stacy&#8217;s clients being targeted, Trevor and Kylie (pretending to be Stacy) must work together to catch the killer before they strike again. Trevor and Kylie start playing with fire when her lap dances turn Trevor into a hormone driven teenage boy.I found myself dreaming about the suspense part of the book. I couldn&#8217;t wait to figure out who was killing Stacy&#8217;s clients and why. But don&#8217;t get me wrong...Trevor McCade is cocky, charming, hot and seriously just makes me smile. I loved watching him chase after the woman he falls in love with, and without any question, that woman is Kylie. Trevor will risk his life and move Heaven and Earth to keep Kylie safe and alive.While reading this book, I found myself looking to see if there were books on Stacy and Trevor&#8217;s equally hot partner Ian Ford. There is!!!! You KNOW a book is good, when you&#8217;re immediately looking for more books. I am so loving Samanthe Beck!Source: Personal Purchase"

"11 15, 2013",B00C333TZU,5.0,Realize,A2K2UYWN5S3BON,"Heather is a very talented artist who feels unsure of herself thanks to a previous abusive relationship. Ryan is one the hottest leading men in Hollywood and owner a very successful business but he was looking to escape the falseness of Hollywood and the women. It seemed every woman he was involved with had an agenda and he wanted more. A chance meeting sometime ago he couldn't get her out of his head and Ryan knew that there was something special about her. After their night together uncertainty creeps up and Heather runs. Not accepting no for an answer Ryan makes her realize that he wants her and does everything to let her know that. Just when it seems that she believes him Heather looks at her beautiful co star and figures she good never measure up. As their love for each other grows so does her inspiration. She is presented with an opportunity that will tear them apart though a jealous ex would love nothing more than to see her fail, she excels. He relocates with her unbeknownst to her and does everything to support her success. I didn't like every time she ran he had to reassure her that she was everything he wanted. It seems even though the ex is out the way the seeds he planted always come out. I gotta love Ryan for his patience and for feeling like someone like Heather is worth. Who wants to spend their entire relationship explaining to them why you are with that person because you want them to be? I think once he settles into his role as full time CEO Heather won't feel so much apprehension. She would soon realize that they're in love despite people coming between them no one ever can. I mean how many guys will make that many sacrifices in the last minute to be with the woman they love. I say he's a keeper and I hope that Heather can let go of her insecurities and realize that."
"09 18, 2013",B00C3O06LO,5.0,Dean and Jillian turn up the HEAT!,AR86TJD9BRPNL,"**** Book gifted by author in exchange for an honest review ****In volume 2 of The Marriage Diaries we kick back off with another diary entry from Jillian briefly describing the change in both her and her husband Dean since they vamped up their sex life.Dean begins to take things to the next level in this one and as they start to explore the kinkier side of sex, (even in a public setting) the excitement level is increased.While rediscovering one another and being open with their fantasies, we get to experience an erotic dinner and drive home and a steamy home office scene that gives a whole new outlook on what a necklace of pearls can be used for.When Dean has to go away on business, it was interesting to see how creative and uninhibited the couple has become, especially Jillian.This story is erotica and involves aspects of BDSM but it's not over the top. What the reader gets to experience is a happily married couple exploring their sexual needs and desires in a completely consensual, safe and loving environment.Again I thought having the duel POV provided depth to the story and with each volume being novella size, it ensures a quick, fun and hot read. I'm enjoying watching the passion these two have for each other ignite and combust."

"05 8, 2013",B00C6SI9UW,4.0,Beautiful story,A23GHQSCI24QI8,"Stormy Surrender by Nicole Andrews Moore was such an inspiring read.  I loved reading about the town of New Hope and it's inhabitants.  Where everybody knows everybody.  The perfect place to start over.  I enjoyed reading this story of moving on and finding yourself.  Letting yourself be happy is so hard to do sometimes, but when you do it is so worth all the hard work and sacrifice.Martha moves to New Hope in search of a new beginning.  She wants a fresh start and being a part from her husband doesn't worry her one bit.  She ends up buying a house for herself.  A fixer upper and her dream.  She meets Joe and a contractor in town.  Martha is looking for some help with his house.  He's perfect for the job too.  He lives just across the street so the commute isn't bad either.  While helping with her renovation they both get to know each other.  Joe is not the settling down kind of guy.  He has been burned in the past.  Unfortunately the girl he seems to want to be with is just that, the settling down kind of girl.  So their story begins and it couldn't be sweeter.These two really are perfect for one another.  Their banter is so amusing.  I just loved reading about their interactions with each other.  Joe also knows exactly what Martha needs.  He knows when she needs comforted and when she needs to be left alone.  They get one another.  It seems that these two are both in need for a fresh start.  They have no doubt found that with each other.This was such a sweet, kind hearted read.  It was very nice to read a story about a new beginning.  I look forward to reading more from Nicole Andrews Moore.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a light hearted love story."
"01 14, 2014",B00C7AO98A,4.0,My Review,A15AC8B33RR0A7,"Eliza Blaylock, Lizzie, is having a rough time.  Her dad's been fired; her sister has tuberculosis; she just had some sort of fit at school for which she's getting kicked out and having to start working.  When she has another fit, slowly she and those around her begin to realize that she may have special powers to communicate with the dead.While not action packed, it's not exactly that kind of story.  There are parts containing a good deal of action, but this is a primarily character driven story.A good deal of background and detail, sometimes subtle detail, go into developing the characters and narrative throughout the tale.Scenery is time appropriate and described with flair.Without giving too much plot away, I will just say this, the underlying mysteries/dilemmas are interwoven nicely.Overall, a fun read."

I fell truly madly in love with Paul and Nic.I wasn'tprepared for such an instant emotional connection and attachment to both.Superb writing and development of the characters within in the story. Iloved the way both Paul and Nic were such strong people. What really gotme, was how each one had a total different life experience to make thisway. The childhoods, families, career choices, relationships, etc.. wereso different. The passion and acceptance in Paul helping to balance outNic's strong determined skiddish personality traits. Excellent job ofcreating realistic desirable lead characters. Oh, and can't forget alsoget to see some familiar faces and catch up with them. It is wonderfulwatching these two start their own magnificent love story. Very goodwriting and format for such a great storyline. I also enjoyed the dialogueand humor that helped make this read so smooth and entertaining. You can'tgo wrong with settings that include the military and educational realms.Positive and supportive reference to subject matter that might beconsidered more difficult to discuss.

It takes place roughly around the time of Alfred the Great.  He suggests the story be read aloud, with inflection and gesticulation, however, without proper punctuation, this proves a difficult task.It appears that the author assumes the reader is aware of the history behind his characters.  Aside from a brief, physical description of each character, there was no explanation of what each characters purpose entailed and even less development.  The targeted audience is definitely children, with a modest vocabulary and simple plot line, however, it seems almost too simple and with no clear direction.All together, this story left me confused.  The writing style lacked any structure, and there was no attempt at connecting the characters outside of the positions they held.  The plot was too haphazard to keep my interest."

Would highly recommend to anyone who appreciates serial killer novels. Darn good read! I didn't put this book down until the end. Over all it was a good read but had moments where it dragged on. I thought the best moments were when the author developed the characters like Cecil O, almost as a side story to the primary story line. The depravity and desperation in this novel leaves nothing to the imagination. A 101 guide in how serial killers are made. The streets of LA won't ever seem the same after reading this book."

Will they be able to get through the obstacles in the way and be together again??Trick was a fabulous quick and easy read that had my full attention immediately!  The story was great!  Lots of action that kept me turning the pages.  I absolutely adored the characters.  Harlow is sweet and I loved how she goes after what she wants, no victim here.  Gunner is sexy as hell and rough around the edges but you just know that he has a big heart.  I love how Lori Garrett added flashbacks throughout the story to give us a look at Harlow and Gunner's while they were young and dating, showing us how in love they were.Trick is definitely one read that you will want to add to your TBR!  It has everything I look for in a fab read; a great love story that I couldn't get enough of, amazing characters that I didn't want to let go of, just the right amount of angst without destroying my heart and, lots and lots of sexy hotness!!!  Trick will have your heart pounding and your pulse racing.  The only problem that I had with Trick... I wanted more.  I wasn't ready for this story to end!NicFlirty and Dirty Book Blog"
"05 14, 2014",B00CI97C8Y,5.0,Tomorrow Once More - A Gripping Dystopian Time Travel Adventure!,A3ULFI74VYDVEY,"Awesome book! Dennis Butler&#8217;s &#8220;Tomorrow Once More&#8221; offers a fascinating romp through time that kept me turning pages into the night! The book begins with the main character, Lane, a participant in a government experiment in time travel, waking with the knowledge that he is at some point in the future, but with no idea how far ahead he&#8217;s truly gone. He quickly discovers that in a subjective eight years, he has actually traveled almost 1500 years away from his own time, from 2253 to 3853! Lane is eager to find out how the world has changed, but he quickly finds out that life in the future is no picnic when he&#8217;s carted off to work as a slave on a corporate prison farm. &#8220;Tomorrow Once More&#8221; does what science fiction does best, hold up a fun-house mirror to our own world and in doing so offer us a seamless critique of where we are and where we may be going. But ultimately, the book is a story of two characters, Lane and Abbie, their growing love, and the desperate leap they take together in the hope of finding another, perhaps better future. I don&#8217;t want to give away any more, but I will say the book held my attention, and I&#8217;m looking forward to reading more from this author. Highly recommended!"
"05 27, 2013",B00CIF3OD0,5.0,Can't wait for the next saga,A1J5DFZMRYYHSM,"It's all about building good characters in a novel, and here Shaw has a collection of them that would not be out of place with a top rated TV series.This is not my first Shaw novel (Lady of Chains), and I am glad that she seems to be improving like a good wine. Here we have a novelist that seems to have matured into a a really good story teller. Vampire and fantasy stories are in abundance, but Shaw's stories stand out with strong characterization and the desire provoked in the reader to want to read on to find out what happens to each person. I await the next book with some relish."

The author's really talented. Everything was so descriptive and the pacing was so good I got sucked in and read it in one sitting. The only thing I would change is I would have liked an epilogue. Since I think she left the door open for sequels (James & Astrid next?) I can't complain too much. Overall it was a fun read. I loved the sparring between Storie and Reid. I can't wait to see what happens next!
"08 11, 2013",B00CKASO60,5.0,A Rousing Western,A8D9VMHVADN03,"I enjoy Van Horns westerns. He's fast becoming another Zane Grey and thats saying something. His characters are well developed and his hero the young Jim Nester should appear in another of his books because he is an interesting man, a bounty hunter who has decided for reasons of his own to give up being one. The three female characters are each exciting in their own way and they lend an important role in this story. My one complaint with Van Horns westerns is that he tends to end them rather abruptly, but other than that, this is a very good book.Engine 24: Fire Storiesby Joe Corso"

"11 22, 2013",B00CMZ7RHA,5.0,A Beautifully Told Lesson For All,A3SMV35531YME,"The topic of bullying is finally being taken seriously by parents, school officials, and the media. Sadly, the catalyst for this change in mentality has been children dying.With this book, Ben Shomer gives the gift of understanding, while also offering much needed direction for change. The actual story is written in a way all kids can relate to. They watch the bullied child become a hero. They learn they don't have to take the abuse, but they also don't have to become like the bully.The section for parents is beneficial for all adults, not just those with young children. The author discusses the various forms of bullying. Adults are bullied as well, though we don't often discuss it or even recognize the behavior for what it is. Adult bullying is typically more subtle but just as damaging.Overall, this is a story that entertains and teaches and, hopefully, opens further discussion on a topic that we've only begun to explore."

The main couple didnt even hold my interest, no chemestry in this book at all! I found myself disliking the characters to be honest, come on did they really need to argue about everything!! Would have been a good story but this was just a book with words it never drew me in only made me mad because to be honest the characters were just stupid and whiny! A whole page about her not wanting to drive the company car? I found myself yelling just take the damn car already say thank you and move on! Sorry to say not my kind of read never even finished the book."
"03 5, 2014",B00CO7GIFI,5.0,Imperfectly perfect characters with intense backstories and a shocking ending,AUFRD70KKDYMC,"Author: Jessica SorensonGenre: Romance/LoveTitle: The Destiny of Violet & LukeSynopsis: Taken from goodreadsLuke Price's life has always been about order, control, and acting tough on the outside. For Luke, meaningless relationships are a distraction-a way to tune out the twisted memories of his childhood. He desperately wishes he could forget his past, but it haunts him no matter what he does.Violet Hayes has had a rough life. When she was young, she was left with no family and the memory of her parents' unsolved murders. She grew up in foster homes, living with irresponsible parents, drugs, and neglect, and trying to fight the painful memories of the night her parents were taken from her. But it's hard to forget when she never got closure-and she can't stop dreaming about what happened that tragic night. To make it through life, she keeps her distance from everyone and never allows herself to feel anything.Then Violet meets Luke. The two clash instantly, yet they can't seem to stay away from each other. Although they fight it, they both start to open up and feel things they've never felt before. They discover just how similar they are. But they also discover something else: The past always catches up with you...Characters: The Coincidence of Callie and Kayden was the first book I ever read by Jessica Sorenson and from the beginning I fell in the love with the darkness behind her characters because they are actually believable. I read books all the time where the characters are written in such a way that makes me vocalize to my iPad &#8216;no one would ever say that, please shut up&#8217;. The flaws of the characters make the book more believable. It also allows the book to stay with you and relate&#8230;well I can&#8217;t relate to either Violet or Luke but I&#8217;m betting some readers can.&#8220;They&#8217;re smiling as they talk to each other and they make it look so easy, so natural, like it&#8217;s as simple as breathing. But even breathing is difficult for me sometimes.&#8221;The characters unraveled in this book the way I expected them too. You get to see more about their background than their transformation, which is expected since this is not the last book with Violet and Luke (yippee!)&#8220;Even though the odds are in my favor, doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;ll end up that way. First rule of cards. And of life.&#8221;I loved that this book was solely about Violet and Luke with minor mentions of Callie and Kayden, It made me want the next sequel of Callie and Kayden more (I see what you did there).&#8220;It's all about her. Every movement, every breath, the way my heart beats fiercely inside my chest, is all because of her. Violet owns me.&#8221;Writing Style (POV): This book alternates between Violet and Luke&#8217;s point of view. There are very few flashback scenes but enough to grasp the context of the &#8216;present&#8217; day.Background: As you read in the synopsis that both characters suffer from intense, dark childhood and early life experiences. Both characters come to the table with large issues but that doesn&#8217;t make this book depressing to me. In their own way they are going to save one another. They are going to both be able to relate and love on a level that most can&#8217;t because of their &#8216;issues&#8217; and their &#8216;destiny&#8217;. Is this book sad? Yes, it is. But this book is also setting the stage for relief in both of their lives. You can see where they are both just so tired of relying on their own self. You&#8217;re going to see them gravitate to one another and hurt one another because they don&#8217;t know how to exhibit healthy love.Cliffhanger/HEA: Let me just say&#8230;. WHAT. I was NOT expecting the end of the story. I honestly love how unpredictable Jessica&#8217;s writing is. I would be bored if I could guess the ending. I&#8217;m anxiously awaiting the next book of their story. HEA? I think eventually, yes. I can&#8217;t wait to see what she does with the story.Evaluation: I thought this was a fantastic book. I have books on my &#8216;read&#8217; list on here that by the title alone I can&#8217;t remember the story and I have to go back and read the reviews to even remember the character&#8217;s names. Jessica Sorenson writes in a way that her characters impact you and don&#8217;t forget. Isn&#8217;t that the point of writing? Telling a story that impacts a reader? Not every love story is a match.com commercial and the sadness in this story is more a reality than an instant HEA. So to me, Jessica did not disappoint.This is a 5 star book for me because:1) It&#8217;s part of a continuous series. I love series. I hate movies but love TV shows because of the continuous story line.2) The characters had a &#8216;realness&#8217; to them. Life is not always rainbows and butterflies.3) I am confident I will remember this storyline based on the title alone 20-30 books down the road."

Any one who has ever had the pleasure of being in a powder keg relationship knows it's not easy to fix and when you think you have it all worked out, something else comes along a throws it out of whack. . The key is to aways communicate with one another and work through them together. Happy reading!"
"06 7, 2013",B00COSIOPE,5.0,A really different story line,A3QBFB6UUP4E20,This book had a very different story line to others of its ilk. The heroine was believable the hero was true to his era I felt. The Big Bang theory was well explained and Einstein's development from the Apes gave me a chuckle at the hero's horror.I really liked this book and hope the author will put out another book about completely different time travel. One thing I would have liked to know was what happened to the native American.
"04 20, 2014",B00CPG1UII,5.0,Exceptional,AGYA9YVKZT7M9,"About a year ago, I read this author's &#34;Glimmer&#34; Trilogy and really enjoyed it. Hundreds of e books later, those characters and story have stuck with me.  When this book popped up available for a free Amazon download, I jumped at the chance to give it a try. Boy am I happy I did!  This book was so well written and addressed a subject I've not yet to see dealt with in a YA novel.  When I bounced to the author's facebook page I noticed her banner said that she is a misfit writing about misfits for misfits. Well, Amen to that!  I am a proud misfit and always have been.  In my younger days I had self esteem issues such as the ones that inhabit the soul of the protagonist, Dani. She was very relatable for me.  Liam is the perfect young man for her and that becomes more evident as the plot unfolds.  Dani is an exuberant, intelligent, open minded, young woman and she is able to embrace diversity. Her best friend in high school was gay and she enjoys a romp in the local, college town, bar that features drag performers. Liam, straight, works there, so we know going in that he is open minded as well. He is very lucky to find his soul mate in Dani.  I just love reading YA novels that are inclusive of all.  A lifelong Californian, I have been an Oregon resident for the past two years so it was also fun to see that the book was set in Oregon. I also have been a fan of red lipstick since my mid-twenties and still proudly wear it still today now that I am fast approaching fifty nine. Long live red lipstick in all its incarnations!I don't believe in writing reviews with spoilers so you will have to trust me that this is a good read about a sensitive subject most of us have no experience with.  The author's note at the end of the book was a brave one for the author to share and I applaud her candour. This appears to be the first in a series with the next book due in May 2014. I can't wait!"

With Nash you see a different side of Della one that I really liked, ""oh, please,"" I snorted. ""I used to let you win so you wouldn't run off pouting to your mom like a baby because a girl beat you."" I mean he's certainly a looker as well, ""he wasn't buff like some weightlifter, but her was lean and tight in all of the right places. He tugged on the gray pajama pants he was wearing, to reveal a pair of black boxer briefs."" Then there's Justin, and you know when you have a keeper when he doesn't give two hoots about morning breath, ""I really could care less."" Justin is a caring person, ""well,"" he finally said. ""I'm a little pissed that you didn't tell me sooner, and I'm a little pissed at your mom. Who seriously acts like that? I don't know how I'm going to prepare myself to meet that woman. she sounds like a real b****."" Halfway through the book and I didn't know if I was team Nash or Team Justin that's just how sweet, kind, and caring both guys are. Justin says the sweetest things, ""c'mon princess,"" he yelled into the bathroom. ""You know I think you look beautiful with or without makeup, we don't have time for your primping s***."" Justin knows what to say to get your heart racing ""you are so effing beautiful right now. So sweet."" his thumb landed on my cheek, brushing it softly. ""But this is going to be rough and hard, baby. Because I can tell that's what we both need right now.""

This is my first CA Williams book and while it was a pleasant read, and I am curious to see how the story unfolds &#8211; I am not sure I was completely sold on this book.Ms Williams spent time developing the characters in this story and you either loved, hated or didn&#8217;t feel much for them at all.  Della started out incredibly unlikeable, her attitude of expectation was offensive, and after learning her story &#8211; I found a little unbelievable.

"05 15, 2013",B00CRNSBJU,3.0,The technology of Big Brother is upon us....,A25HWUX0L2DCFM,"I really enjoyed the Frank Pavlicek books by StrakaCold Quarry (A Frank Pavlicek Novel)series. I think he has the ability to create a great story with memorable characters.This isn't anywhere near his usual standard.I can see the inkling of a concept which could have questioned the morality of weaponry used in warfare in our era, it could have reflected more on the plight of the forgotten victims of that warfare and it could even have been a good poster child for the dangers of tenchnology.Instead it was a disjointed and often confusing piece of work.The most positive element was the focus on the use of micro technology and drones, both in war and espionage. It just seemed very thrown together or perhaps edited in a way that makes it appear to lack a competent flow in the storyline. His work is usually well researched and the characters gel well with each other.Overall for me it lacked the Strakasim that I have come to enjoy and I hope this athor gets his groove back.When it came to rating this book I had a hard time. I am a plot person and believe it warrants only 2 stars, but there are some redeeming qualities and the plot has potential, so a three it is.I received a free copy of this book via NetGalley."

I had read and really enjoyed the last three books; however, the last book ended on such a sad note and I truly am a HEA gal...soooo, long story short, I got this book but was just never in the mood to read it knowing that Niki was suffering from all of her losses.  Well, I will admit there was some angst in the beginning and throughout the book BUT there was so much more than that!! There was romance and HEA.  NO, you say, how can that be? Well, I highly recommend reading this book and finding out how this reader was so satisfied with this book and this entire series.  Wonderful urban fantasy with a kick butt heroine and awesome world building, with hints of romance."

That said, I thought that this might be a good book, but it was just so boring. I persisted reading until the end hoping it would get better - and hopefully to the point - but it never quite arrived. It fell flat and far short of my expectations. I skipped whole paragraphs and speed read at times where it started circling the drain here & there, but it never did become interesting. And it just ended so abruptly in such an odd choice of place that I thought the end was left out of the book (maybe it was?). I'm so sorry, I just didn't enjoy it. Ah well, two days lost I'll never get back, but I'm relieved it's over."

"08 16, 2013",B00CW0B32U,4.0,Original and funny,A3OWLCVON8K04H,"A fun and engrossing story, with a good mystery wrapped in tongue-in-cheek humor. As if that weren't enough, the main character, Molly, shares her insights with excellent original cartoons throughout the book, and although the story is told in first person from Molly's point of view, the author is a main character in the book and even a main suspect. The ladies' fascination with sex seemed a little over the top, but then, as Molly said, maybe it's because they weren't getting any. Besides, everyone is exaggerated here.  I found The Secret Life of Molly Rosenblum original, funny, and well written."
"12 26, 2013",B00CW16O28,4.0,Good stories,A1D4E8SDPRJTVF,"This books sort of reads like a few episodes of the Investigation Discovery show ""Deadly Women"". They are recounted well: background on the perpetrators, the actual event and why they might have done it.But there are a couple of flaws: wrong dates in a few places and strange social commentary at times. For example, at the end of one recounting of a mass murder the author states, ""Sylvia is a victim of a failed mental health system"" where to me it seemed like Sylvia was clearly the one to blame. At the end of the book, while the author smartly recommends speaking to a professional if someone you know is exhibiting erratic behavior, she also recommends ""more gun control"". Gun control for who? The mentally sick who shouldn't get guns or the general population who needs to protect themselves from these people and criminals at large? The book clearly demonstrates the need for the former but definitely not the latter.Otherwise, it's a good book and I recommend it if you're interested in learning about female rampage killers. Great title by the way (not to make light of the atrocities)."

Bethany Snow, nursing a heavy cold is assigned to solve a case on a movie location in the southern part of the country. Seth Carbery, the movie star receiving hate mail, and Bethany are instantly attracted to each other when she arrives with her brother Jake. They are there to protect the actor from the perceived threats. Sizzle, humor, and some sadness thread through the plot as the erotic love affair and the case progress. Great to see a sexy, forthright, lady detective in this story. Her brother Jake is a lovely character and it would be great to see him have his own story. A very good read."

"07 6, 2013",B00CYPPEUA,4.0,GREAT RAINY WEEKEND READ!,A2Y99DSQKKJNZH,"This is the first book that I've read by Marabeth James and I loved it.  In fact, I just got finished downloading all her other books.  Now, I can read them ""in order""! Had nothing but rain here for the past two weeks and so this put me in the mood for her book(s). THEIR HAUNTED EYES  definately left me wanting to read more. And, being that it was taking place down in NOLA, my home town, I had a special interest in it. When they were in the cemetery, I felt like I was actually there. When they were having beignets, I could actually smell them and felt like I had powdered sugar all over me! This is really a good, easy read. If you have rain falling, all the better. I can't wait to start reading the first book in the series of these sisters. I hope down the road that they will find their endless love."

"10 2, 2013",B00CZXWTHC,3.0,A good book,A2WDC81C1MQUAS,"I received an ARC copy in exchange for an honest reviewI liked this book. It has some mystery and suspense that keeps you guessing, and some hot steamy sex scenes as well. The chemistry between Alaina and Donovan is pretty hot to be sure. After Alaina and Donovan first meet, things are pretty tense, Donovan is a FBI agent trying to get papers that Alaina's had left her, but she has been assigned to keep them safe, and only a select few are allowed to see them. After going to court, they decide to keep things professional until the judgment has been made, but that doesn't last long. After a threat to Alaina's life, Donovan takes Alaina to a safe house, and from there things get interesting. After an intimate moment, Donovan has promised to keep his hands off Alaina until things are back under control.Once things slow back down, Alaina and Donovan decide to see where things go between them. That is until Alaina finds out what Donovan has been keeping from her. Alaina can't trust Donovan anymore and tries to push him away. But once again Alaina has someone coming after her, and the only one she trusts to keep her safe is Donovan. Will Alaina be able survive this last attack so that she can tell Donovan that she forgives him?I liked the suspense in the book, and Anna Wells does a good job at keeping you guessing what's next. I can't wait to see what happens next."
"11 14, 2013",B00D0EWRIG,3.0,good read,ABY4VSPEWNLXK,"ok read.  When it comes to light that a young single woman is living on a ranch with two men, although one is only 14 years old, do you really wonder why someone would point out what type of relationship this looks like, even though it did come out of the mouth of the bad guy.  The relationship that develops between the two adults was good."
"03 1, 2014",B00D0MMUEO,3.0,So much Potential...Too bad,A2JQN9JI4LBLOW,"I have to give an honest review here.  First of all I was looking forward to reading this book because I love Viking Romances.  Here are the Pros and cons for me:Pros - I loved Hakan and Helena.  The premise of the story was great.  I loved how they met, Hakan's past, his ex, son, best friend, and what he wanted for his future.  All of that was good thinking and brilliant. Abduction, slavery, friendships, loyalty, past love, jealousy, betrayal, beserkers, kings, family history, romance, laughter, banter, disappointment, and hope.  The potential was there for an epic Viking Romance Series.Cons - 1.  It took me until chapter 7 to even be interested, I almost stopped reading this book, but I am glad I gave it more of a chance because I loved the story from there on.  2.  Viking Romances normally have quite a bit of sex in them.  It makes sense because of the era.  This book lacked that and that in my opinion was disappointing.  It was way too tame for my taste.  3.  It was too rushed in the end and that was sad.  4.  Epilogue should not have been in the book.  The epilogue took place hours after the book ""ended"".  5.  Too many questions unanswered.  He was supposed to go on an important mission, What the heck happened to Sven?  6.  If the author was going to continue the story in a sequel...the book did not inform me (the reader) of this.  I was left wanting to know what happened from there to Hakan, Helena and Eric, his mission, consequences for Gorm, and again what the heck happened to Sven?"
"06 4, 2013",B00D0V5BU0,5.0,Fun Summer Read!,AOF25QWK7AUT7,"If you're looking for a book to entertain the kiddos this summer, than look no further. I had previously read Ziggy Zook's book, Stinky Feet, to my granddaughter and grandson who were very attracted to the subject matter, as most 5 and 9 year olds are, so we were pleased to find another ""odoriferous"" topic to read about. The duel subject matter of zoo animals and passing gas, was irresistible. My granddaughter's favorite was the baby kangaroo being jet propelled from his mother's pouch by his own gas emissions. My grandson liked the fire ants' red puffs that smelled like burnt toast and the striped zebra clouds.The illustrations are fun and colorful and the rhyming prose is entertaining. I'm sure I'll be rereading this book many times."

Very interesting story line and it kept my interest all the way through. The only thing I didn't like was that there is going to be only one more novella left and I have been looking forward to meeting Luke since the first book. Please don't leave him hanging. I need to know what happens to him.

Although this was a short story it was well written and grabs you right from the start and keeps you interested to the very end. I highly recommend this whimsical romance story.
"01 16, 2014",B00D4MN40O,4.0,A Good Start to an Interesting Series,A1VQCYJNMU9050,"I thoroughly enjoyed the storyline and pacing of this novel.  However, it's definitely written for adults and NOT FOR KIDS.  The explicit nature of the intimacy in this story was, in my opinion, a distraction that didn't add to the story.  I prefer the way Anne McCaffrey handled intimacy, leaving most of the details to the reader's imagination.However, the strength of the story is very compelling, and I look forward to reading more about Aneka Jansen."
"07 26, 2013",B00D4MN40O,3.0,Sex does not always sell,A1DTSET17K9R0Z,"This is the second inexplicably explicit novel I've read recently, and just like ""Good Intentions"", the sex in ""Steel Beneath the Skin"" overpowers what was a strong story with potentially excellent characters. But I guess it's one hundred percent 'caveat emptor' when the cover art is a topless platinum blond with a big gun and tight leather pants!Despite that, I still liked the book because the bones are good and the energy levels high...or should that be stamina levels?...and I found myself forgiving/ignoring Teasdale's adolescent fantasy writing and focusing on the more interesting plot lines.But let's get the sex out of the way first, because it is adolescent and strangely, after the first couple of graphic encounters, Teasdale dials down the descriptions of wanton womanly parts - because it's mostly girl-on-girl action here - but significantly increases passing references to sex way beyond the point of believability. Because it's not just a few characters who are drawn to each other, pretty much any human character in the novel struts their stuff in expectation of an orgy or two. It was not titillating, it was not hot, and after awhile it was not even interesting, so hopefully Teasdale gets the point that sci-fi readers want plot more than porn.So, about that plot. Teasdale gives us a strong high-tech focus with the alien abduction of baseline human Aneka Jansen, a derelict alien space ship and an android emulation chassis, closing the Amazon Book Description with the enticing 'Is she really still the woman she thinks she is?'.There is a galaxy of really fundamental questions for Teasdale to explore just from that point alone, but for the most part the exploration is superficial and inconsistent. Aneka died a thousand years ago, yet a host of her alien-built technology is far superior to the human equivalent, which suggests that humanity has atrophied in the sciences department. And I was initially annoyed that Aneka could understand these thousand year older humans, and Teasdale gave a pat answer soon after, but it's not convincing. Also unconvincing is the fear of robots and embedded electronic devices. I can see how a strongly regulated society could maintain that, but this society seems anything but, so it's a taboo that felt particularly contrived.On the macro scale, we seem to maintain a large military presence with seriously expensive space hardware, but with no wars to fight, the economics of that don't make much sense. And people from the less developed rim planets can come work in the older, more established planets and earn enough in a couple of years to nicely retire back home. It's a lovely fable, but the economics don't stack up. And if there really is no crime to speak of, and peace across the universe, what would the future-CIA actually do? Finally, given the birth rate this society would have died off centuries ago, despite their casual promiscuity and glorification of sexual congress.There are positives of course. Aneka is well drawn, showing an excellent balance of resilience and concern. Her military background makes her actions generally convincing and she is good to have on your side in a fire-fight! And the Chief of the future-CIA is one of those shadowy background types that are fun to have around in this type of story.Still, it's slim pickings but perhaps Teasdale felt that trading off thoughtful, well reasoned sci-fi for page upon page of cunnilingus and screaming orgasms was what readers wanted. Perhaps they do? But for me, and apparently for many others, it is not an acceptable trade off."
"05 31, 2014",B00D4WYGFG,2.0,Reviewed by KyBunnies,ARVET37SOADAZ,"I was really looking forward to some helpful information in this book.  Well it is not actually a book, more like a pamphlet.  Not a lot of information and most of it is repeated several times.  The author keeps directing readers to her blog.  Sorry if I wanted to visit her blog I would.  I purchased the book for information not a link to her blog.Walking is a great idea.  It is easy, does not cost anything and anyone can do it.  As the author stated ""Anyone can walk"".  i walk to try and help build muscle in my leg from a broken knee.  (Yes, I was advised by a doctor to do this).  Honestly this book did not tell me anything I did not know.With the repeat information, lack of line editing, and simple writing in this book I do not recommend it.  After searching Google I found more information about walking that the 20 minutes I spent reading this book.  Sadly, I paid $3.99 for this information that is FREE.Sadly I would NOT recommend this book."

Every character has something special about him or her that make you want to know more about them and their history. Each book is a real page turner and I just have to know what happens next to Rose and Company. The writing is excellent, backdrop is beautiful and rich, and I'm happy to be reading such a wonderful series. I can't wait for the next one~Iron Tears."

Covers submarine and countermeasures development, tactics, strategy, individuals and their quirks. Was particularly interested in the Battle of the Atlantic.

I must rely entirely on the author and his vivid imagination as I am constantly astounded with the military mind and second nature behavior of the men and women who are all enhanced with the Eden Plague and nanonites, which quickly heals and rebuilds the human body along with extending life, from the first Plague Series, and who unhesitatingly go into battle or any dangerous action without a second thought.  I also particularly enjoy the structure that defines each species.Thank you David VanDyke for the Amazon gift of this latest in the Series!"

The relationship between the sisters is an interesting part of the story, but the mystery of who killed her father and stepmother is foremost in setting up the basis of this story. The author's style clearly stated the facts in an interesting and poignant way where the reader can experience the emotions - both painful and joyous throughout sisters' lives."

The stories are all stand alone. I love the fact that the heroine in each story is a strong independent woman who challenges her man and makes him work for her love. I loved Up close, Matthew was really sweet, sexy but honourable, had integrity.He resisted sleeping with Amy because he was in it for committment and he wasn't sure she was.It takes him almost dying for them to realise life is to short.I found Tempting Trace hilarious. He thought he was evening a score but it ending up backfiring. This author has written realistic contemporary stories that make you feel good and help you unwind after a stressful day."

"06 6, 2014",B00DE74F84,4.0,Eye-opening for all Americans,A1YBM3LBZ07QQS,"We've all heard mutterings from both sides of the aisle about the causes of high gas prices, attributing it to whatever evil best fits their agenda. That's one of the things that makes Gas At 1.25 Per Gallon: How We Get There in Six Weeks so unique - it's pretty nonpartisan in nature, it in no way tries to subversively make the reader hate the President or all big business, and it's about much more than lowering gas prices (though that's a big draw for middle-class readers) - it's about the American economy as a whole.Think the media doesn't pick and choose which topics to cover? After reading this book, you'll think again. I watch a lot of political commentary, and I've never once heard about the QE (quantitative easing) programs that Rice discusses at length. Once you read how they work, you'll consider that a pretty terrifying thought.Many books like this draw you in claiming to have a solution, then spend two hundred pages complaining about the same problems we all recognize. This is where this book truly stands apart - it offers real solutions, the possible issues that could arise from implementing them, and what to do in contingency. That is a serious rarity.Although this book is definitely biased toward the middle class, one can argue that as a country we should be making policy decisions that favor the middle class because they by definition are the mass of our population. All in all, this is a read every American should take the time to digest. It could open a lot of minds and doors to a real, permanent solution."

"09 3, 2013",B00DGXKBBQ,1.0,Should have been better,AEENNATK67HLG,"This series is one of my favorite indie series on amazon. I've waited so long for this book to come out, but I would have gladly waited another year to see it come out right. It was such a disappointment, it's like it was written by two different people. The plot was poorly thought out and unforgivably rushed. Whole sections were unbelievable or downright ridiculous. The characters were radically different than previous books. It read like a bad first draft with no polish, no editing, and constant typos. The dialog was stale, the action passable but not thought out, the characters one dimensional. It was the complete polar opposite of the previous books in the series. If the author has any honor at all this book should be re-written and republished the way it should have been. It makes me hesitate about following any other series by you in fear that you might get bored and fail to conclude it properly."
"01 6, 2014",B00DH5FCPI,3.0,Wonderfully written but disturbingly off-centered,A1KADAOKG5WWTR,"I liked the first-person, narrow-focus style. I really liked aspects of Jane's character, and Nathan won me over completely. I like the flawed nature and constant testing and self-examination of the characters, though the harsh language was off-putting. Who are the good guys? Who are the bad guys? What are the motivations and the real, underlying character qualities that make these people tick? I understand the need to keep readers interested in continuing a series, but if we have to wait until future episodes to learn basic answers to the questions about why the Gatehouse and the Sacks really exist, I think that's expecting too much of the reader. The reformations, the betrayals, the moles, the gyrating &#34;who can you trust?&#34; issues clogged up the flow for me. I got worn out by the chaos over who is really a good guy and a bad guy. The moral compass is spinning too fast for me. I need good guys and bad guys, not and endless cycle of revenge versus thrill-kill. I hope Kaufmann finds some sort of true north before the next book."

"08 5, 2013",B00DINDMRY,5.0,Love this author's work,AE58P91NU14LP,"I read Kaylee's Keeper first and loved it. (Kinky and dirty - can't wait to read more from the Castle series!) Then a short spanking story called ""Kindred"" she wrote and now this. I have read many erotic novels with my favorite's being Violet Blue 's edited erotic anthologies and Anne Rice's Sleeping Beauty trilogy.  Maren Smith's writing appeals to me because it is not only a sexy read, but she writes likeable and believable characters within an interesting plot.  I am also a lover of spanking stories and this seems to be a theme throughout her books.  In this book I love the story so much. One of my favorite parts is when Jamie dresses in a French Maid costume unsure if whether Travis is into role playing or not.  I won't spoil it, but it will make you want to buy one if you don't already have one in your closet. ( I do and my husband loved it when I ""serviced"" him!)  Sorry this book has me worked up!  At the end of the book is a teaser from Kaylee's Keeper.  I will definitely buy more reads from this author - she stands out from what seems like an explosion of female erotic authors in recent years."

This book has it all, heat, sweetness, romance, drama, a movie star, and a virgin, preachers daughter stripper! Yep has it all! This is a fun, emotional,sexy read. My only complaint, I didn't want it to end. This tends to be my issue with Jasinda's books, I never want them to end. Dawson is off the charts schmexy, and Grey, you just fall in love with her. This is a story about learning who you are, and stepping completely out of your comfort zone. Touching, and sweet this latest book, is well past worthy of the wait!

"08 17, 2013",B00DJB6KE2,5.0,Jasinda Never Let's You Down,A3HCHT4UDOVXIH,"I always wonder how Jasinda does her research for all the different subjects she writes about. In this book she has to understand the subjects of dance, film production, Baptist religion, and stripping. Not thoroughly, mind you, but enough to write this book well, which she did. This story centers around Grey, a girl who had to fight through many obstacles to follow the career path she wanted, even if it wasn't what her overprotective father wanted for her and how that fight shaped her life and brought her to the love she hoped to find.

But the deception at Planet Core continues, and Brook doesn't realize the depth of her father's involvement until he orders her terminated. Struggling to stay alive, she quickly learns nothing is as she believed.Will she ever find Melina? Or will Brook be stuck light years from home, alone, and with a fierce predator hunting her down?First off I would like to mention that this was my first F/F that I've read so needless to say that when I sat down to read this I didn't expect to like it..... I was WRONG. I loved reading Brook and Melina's story.Just be prepared that this is a very quick read but has an well developed plot that will keep you interested in the book.This is a Sci-fi Romance with only 59 pgs. It's the 2nd Bk. in this series but can be read as a stand-alone. I would recommend reading this one !!*I received this Book Free for an Honest Review*"
"08 7, 2013",B00DKERZP6,5.0,Young love and a scary camp out.,A3KKFG3TA9IO8X,"Stevie-girl does it again, at least her talented author did it again.  This series is becoming a guilty pleasure.  When I grow tired of reading about vampires and zombies, I can turn back time and enjoy a really good wholesome ghost story.  Can a ghost story really be wholesome?  You bet!It's 1971 and Stevie-girl is growing up.  She joins Jase and his family on a camping trip, leaving West Texas and heading into the mountains of New Mexico, the Land of Enchantment.  Stevie and Jase immediately check out the nearby bridge, where stories claim a ghost baby wails on certain nights.  Of course, they immediately hear the ghost--you knew they would--and see a filmy lady dressed in white.This is a delightful story that explores memories of young love, jealousy, fear, and courage.  Readers will remember tasting their first smores, or catching a fish and smelling it cook over an open campfire.  Your heart will pound as Stevie faces...no I'm not going to tell you!  You really must read this charming tale for yourself.  Read it to your kids or simply enjoy your own guilty pleasure and escape back to a simpler time.  I recommend this book to the young and nearly young readers."

The author explains the benefits and challenges of using bitcoin and explains several ways to protect yourself against the pitfalls of cyber-cash. I believe bitcoin shows great promise, despite its technical challenges. Just consider how many people are already using Paypal, which is in way, an alternate form of paying for transactions.If you haven't read much about digital cash yet this book will expand your mind.

Really good character development,  I usually read her books in one sitting as I want to find out what is going to happen.  She can build a scene so the reader sees it perfectly in the reader's mind.  She has no gratuitous heavy sex scenes that so many authors feel they need in order to sell their books.  Her books seem to be about real people in real situations.  I always feel like I know these characters personally."

His novels ""Drummer Boy"" and ""The Red Church"" place us in the Appalachian South, and McFall caries us further into the characters and history that Nicholson has already established. (And for those of us who've read them, have fallen in love with).Although you don't necessarily need to read the previously named novels before this series, it is helpful to get a richer idea of this quaint area's history and the characters that dwell within. I say that like they are real, because at some point they became real to me. A real town, a winding and checkered history filled with specters and haints.This first segment of the McFall series is, again, eerie yet inviting, and I look forward to seeing where Nicholson takes us this time."
"08 16, 2013",B00DOIT7QI,5.0,Amazing short read for EVERYONE!,A2S6353JSH01ZI,"I have to admit there was a tiny bit of trepidation when I purchased this book. So many books are written so that they ""preach"" their interpretation of the Gospel rather than fully sharing the Gospel itself and the Lord's interpretation. I can tell you whole heartedly this is not one of those. It quotes the scripture and then shares the explanations that are also written within the Holy Scripture.This book shares various stories and experiences of Christians that had yet to fully ask for or accept the ""Power"" of the Holy Spirit in their lives. I won't create a spoiler here but this is a must read for all of us that still struggle with mortal shortcomings."
"09 7, 2013",B00DOZ8PT6,5.0,Heart warming,A14ZDANVIG51R8,Thoroughly enjoyed reading this. I found myself not wanting to stop reading I simply loved it. Everyone needs a place to escape the day to day frustrations. I found a heaven in this book.

Aside from the great horsey-backdrop, Forewarning is a complex, well-written mystery with plenty of richly layered characters, each with their own emotional baggage. And then there is the healing aspect, which I found quite interesting and unique.Overall, I'd recommend this book to anyone who like their mysteries with a bit of romance, complex human emotions, and on-the-edge of your seat finales. The horses and healing are free of charge :-)"
"07 8, 2013",B00DPMATHY,4.0,Wonderful Romance,A4SQFN8YODDVU,"In general I'm not a big reader of contemporary romance, but one whose heroine rescues/fosters cats and dogs, and is building a business building cat furniture, wins me over anytime. I've actually been looking forward to Edie Ramer's Rescued Hearts series since she first posted the cover and an excerpt on her blog. Abby and Holden are living proof that opposites attract, and you can't help but root for them as they fall in love despite trying so hard not to.Of course for me, Abby's pets stole the show. Wise Siamese Minnie was rescued from the streets; black cat Quigley was a foster that went unadopted until Abby kept him; Golden Retriever Lion; and white foster kitty Epic. These little angels join forces to smack some sense into the silly humans that can't see what's right in front of their eyes.""Minnie didn't know what was wrong with the human brain; she just knew the world would be a better place if humans thought like cats.""  Indeed."

"07 21, 2013",B00DQGAZK0,5.0,A Great Primer On Dealing With Stress,A1ZDARQYYBN9WO,"A simple truth is that if you are alive you are going to have to deal with stress. The key question is how you handle it. A negative example would be the alcoholic who uses drink to temporarily hide from the issues he is dealing with. A positive example would be someone who uses stress as a catalyst to achieve great things at his occupation. The choice is up to you. This book is all about using the stress that we will all experience by simply living life in a positive way. The author leaves no stoned unturned as he discusses such topics as diet, meditation and visualization to turn negative stress into a positive form. As the great Dale Carnegie said, ""It isn't what you have, or who you are, or where you are, or what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy. It's what you think about"". If this makes sense to you get this book to learn how to do it and learn to live stress free."
"07 20, 2013",B00DQSVNT0,3.0,Interesting and confusing,ARQ1IR27J5EWM,"I had read a sample of this book when it had a price on it and thought that it was interesting. Then when I saw that it was free I snatched it up. I did enjoy the premise of this story. And thought that both characters were interesting. I was confused when the heroine started calling Gearon ""My Lord"" all of a sudden. I mean yeah she had been taken by the guy and had really no idea if he was going to kill her, but when she started calling him ""My Lord"" for no reason, just confused me. And the thing that really really confused me was the fact that when there was that tube down her throat that was giving her nutrients for the Bonding, she was still able to talk normally. The fact that she was able to speak so clearly was incredible. I just couldn't see a conceivable way for her to speak and be understood so readily. Other than these two things I really did enjoy this book, but only as a one time read."

"07 30, 2013",B00DT4E82A,5.0,"Terrific story of intrigue, history, and romance!",A217BVTGFAZBLT,"Verity's Lie is the final book in The Huntley Trilogy and it is a fitting wrap-up to this great series.  Verity Verrinder (how I love that name!) lives a sheltered life under her father's autocratic thumb so she thinks she is much less interesting, charming, and pretty than she actually is.  Charles Huntley, Lord Ryevale, lives the burned out life of an aristocratic spy, tired of being the charming ne'er do well rake that must sift through the secrets of the Ton.  When Verity's diplomatic father must travel to Europe to help form the coalition to take on Napoleon, Ryevale is commandeered for the job of her protector.  Who better than the man who knows both the need for keeping Verity safe from French political plots and has the ability to intimidate those in Society who might try to take advantage of the lady while her father is gone?  He knows women want him so he decides to keep her occupied with his attentions; how very generous of him.One thing I love most of all about this author is that she writes strong heroines.  Verity is very innocent and unaware but she is not hopelessly naive.  She suspects Ryevale's motives for paying her attention from the outset.  She wonders at his regard and questions his motives to his face.  He's handsome and she is attracted but she is not about to swoon.  Another thing I love is that the author lets us hear what the heroes think.  We get to know when they are unsure of themselves or feel terrible for what they have done, but we are also privy to their struggle with their emotions.  We get to see how they work through their feelings.  Lord Ryevale admires Verity from the outset, for her outspokenness and failure to be impressed by superficiality.  She intrigues him and he wants to know her better...which makes him regret the subterfuge he employs to keep her safe.  When all comes to a head and secrets are revealed we understand why Verity and Ryevale each feel the way they do.My interest was captured from beginning to end in this book.  I have looked forward to Ryevale's story since his introduction in the first book, Eulogy's Secret, and the author did not disappoint.  Verity was the perfect match for him; she challenged his preconceptions, called him on his self-centeredness, and looked past his facade of affected boredom.  Likewise, Ryevale challenged Verity to live a little, to come outside her ivory tower and see that enjoyment did not mean ruination.  She takes him to a reformation meeting; he takes her to Vauxhall.  The descriptions of both are spot-on.The chemistry between the H and h was steamy.  The combination of her innocent desire and lack of experience pushed all the right buttons in Ryevale to make him question his shallow affairs and the empty women he had previously pursued.  She questioned his interest but decided his kisses (and more!) were worth it.  They both have the bonus of father issues so it's a match made in Freudian heaven.I simply loved this story and read it in one rainy afternoon, shooing the kids to their rooms for their own books and ignoring the dirty dishes.  I feel the need to praise the trilogy, too, since this is the final book.  The Huntley Trilogy is one for the virtual bookshelf, to be picked up and read again over the years.  They do not have to be read in order, but other characters are referenced and plot lines are discussed, so I recommend starting with Eulogy.  And if you don't have the first two books, you really should.  Some may notice a few grammatical and typing errors, but they do nothing to take away from the integrity of the story (and I have yet to find a book that doesn't have an error or two), so it's a non-issue for me.  I really enjoyed these books!"

I especially liked the message this book was conveying about the importance of perseverance in order to achieve your goals. The writing style was clear and very engaging, and I can definitely see kids connecting with the material. The pictures were also bright and fun! The formatting seemed a bit off on my cloud reader, but I suspect that has more to do with my web browser than the book itself. Overall, I think this book is engaging and fun, and I would recommend it for the classroom or for parents to read to their kids! Loved the video also! Great Book!"
"04 24, 2014",B00DTLOQ2U,3.0,Probably a good book for fans of fairy tales,A33Z7O75Z6DE0E,"I agree with the heroine.... ""This is ridiculous. Unbelievable.""The writing is good, but not as good as the author's other works which I thoroughly enjoyed. While the dialogue occasionally seemed stilted, the plot and characters are excellent. I liked Sir Nathan as a hero and feisty Vanessa as a heroine. The premise of them meeting when Vanessa's grandmother asks Nathan to discover Vanessa's secret is very interesting. The first three-fourths of the book is promising, but when Nathan inserts himself into Vanessa's secret it fell apart for me. I think he would have followed her and confronted her rather than pushing his way in. And as Vanessa says, the resolution is ""ridiculous"" and ""unbelievable.""  I would have preferred a slightly different solution which I won't specify so as not to give away the secret. This is an OK book but I require a lot of logic in my stories (I really dislike fairy tales). This book will probably appeal to readers who are more easily swept away by fairy tales and find them delightful.Though this book did not match my tastes, I really enjoyed the author's other storiesA Heartless Design (Secrets of the Zodiac),Love Is Blind - A Regency Romance (Secrets & Second Chances), andA Winter's Knight - A Regency Romance. I'm sure I'll read more of her books in the future."

And, I cried while reading this book (hence my review title  LOL) This book touched me on a lot of different levels.  On a personal level due to a loss I've had in my life.  This book reminded me of those moments and not to forget what is important in life.  My husband kept asking me if I was ok because of my sobbing at one point.This is a well written book that not only has sad moments, but it has moments of laughter that give you a lift and time to catch your breath in between those ""sob fests"".  And moments of remembering a love that you have or have had in your life.  I am *SPOILER ALERT* glad he got to see his child because I would have been even more heart broken if that hadn't happened.  Thank you for that!If anyone has had a loss like that, you know the book was well written because you will feel some of the pain again as you go through the highs and lows that this couple experiences.  But in the end we all know the moment was/is definitely worth the time.A Taylor Made Life is a book I will definitely read again."

"08 1, 2013",B00DUXS4Z2,5.0,Sensual masterpiece of a timeless love.,A1NHP7TMKI70AG,"It is hard to write a review that will do this book justice, but I'm going to try.This is a story of a boy named David who discovers his sexuality in seventh grade when he finds exquisite beauty in another boy's hand.  He realizes that he is different and that he has no control or choice -- it is just who he is.  He begins to run to distance himself from the feelings of being different. He takes a girlfriend to try and conform to expectations but he cannot escape his feelings.  As David begins to build his lawn care business he stumbles upon Ryan, a boy who seems to have it all but is living in the shadow of his dominating, abusive father.  Ryan dreams of being a horticulturist but his father has other plans for him -- to be the football star he could not be.  Ryan and David's relationship evolves over time and I'm not going to spoil this book for you by telling you more, but this book is magical.  When they finally share their first kiss, this is how it is described:  ""His breath was inside me.  I tasted what he tasted like.  All of the scents of that instant cascaded upon me.  His sweat.  The roses...The sweet raspberries on his mouth.  It left a thunderous softness in me.  My legs buckled.  He caught me.  Lowered me into the garden...""And their love continues to grow.  It survives and it endures.  It is timeless.So, get this book.  Pour yourself a glass of Tang and a plate of Hydrox cookies (think Oreos) and join David and Ryan on an adventure of the heart.  You'll be changed.Five stars because that is all I'm allowed, but I tell you something, it deserves more."

I LOVE that the female main character (Sophi) is so strong, despite everything she has gone through. And Eric?! Besides the fact that he is gloriously HOT, I absolutely adore that he is both a fierce commander and warrior, and yet a gentle lover and caregiver. If I could order up a husband, Eric just might be it! :) I was also very happy to see that we still got some scenes from the Tetriarch's points of view. I enjoyed them in the first book, and it really helps to tie everything together between the books. And of course, there was some fantastic, scorching hot, steaminess between Sophi and Eric in the bedroom! This story line is so believable, and relatable, even if it does take place on a planet, Lord knows where in space, that is sentient, and fueled by sex. :)I can't wait to read Hers to Cherish"

I will say it is one of the most emotionally powerful and honest books I have read in a long time.  That also means, it is not the easiest book to read.  There is no white knight and no easy fixes. Jessica clearly did her research when writing this book. I have read everything that I know of that Jessica has written and in all honesty, I think this is her best work.  I should mention that this is Nova book one, so do not expect everything to be tied up in a pretty bow at the end of the story.  That being said, the story is not all left open and hanging.  Some major decisions were made and some important healing took place.  It is not half a book.  It is a whole story with simply more to come.  It should be noted : This book deals heavily with the aftermath of suicide, anxiety, and with drug use and addiction."

It was a satisfyingly long read, the storyline was totally unique and the leading characters are so real and so deep that I actually sniffled a few times and smiled visibly (I.DONT.DO.THAT!)This is the kind of book that makes you change your outlook on life without any heavyhandedness. You start out totally hating the Hero's guts and thinking he's scum and then, as you get to see his side your heart starts thawing little by little until you realize you love him just as much as the heroine. A great read with a happy ending!"

"10 14, 2013",B00E1V5S7Y,4.0,Erotica Well Represented,A3L1Z0R3ZB2OFU,"Finally! An author that depicts the BDSM lifestyle correctly and with class. Christine d'Abo has offered readers a glimpse into the BDSM world that is authentic and readable, with interesting characters and beautifully detailed settings. The BDSM scenes do not just exist for shock value; they actually frame events and move the story along. This novella does a great job of introducing a set of characters in a short amount of space, and not shorting any of the characters. I look forward to other books in the series, and will pick up book 1, Sexcapades, as soon as possible!. The story was strong and well-plotted, the characters engaging,Ms. d'Abo writes with wit and humor, and the sex - off the chain. I will definitely read this series.*I received my copy from NetGalley.com in exchange for an honest review."

This book kept me on the edge of my seat wanting to know what would happen next. I loved that it never had a boring part. so ready for the next book! ! but for now I'm off to read the first one :)"
"03 5, 2014",B00E2QSXJ8,1.0,"Lacking - no table of content, no links, not kindle friendly",A3RXQF95VPGXI4,"The first thing I noticed is that there is not table of content, thus no links to follow to the section of choice.1. thing covered is various juicers, what the do and the prices2.  an 8 day meal plan.  This is food you eat NOT juice.  I thought I was getting recipes?3.  Recipes for veggie fritatta, stir fry salad, spelt griddle cakes, tomato/potato salad, herb salad dressing, chickpeas with mushrooms and rice,veggie soup, red beans and rice, and fried eggplant.The juicing recipes start 29% of the way thru the book  some of them are not very well written, but the average juicer has enough sense to remove pits from stone fruits.  But to read the actual receipe you might wonder:66) Summer Sunset - replenishing.  2 kiwis peeled, 1 nectarine quartered and seeded, 1 nectarine, 1 peach, 1 tangerine quartered and seeded.  Juice all fruits together. Pour into glasses and sere immediately.There are 100 juice recipes plus soup recipes.  I would like this book except for 2 things:  1.  I don't need an 8 day meal plan because I like to choose what I want to eat, not what a book tells me to eat.  The title leads me to believe this is about juicing, but it's not, it's partly about juicing.  The most important thing is there is no list of recipes.  I can't just open the book, and click on a link, I have to go thru pages one by one or hand write those I want to remember.The avocado/tomato gazpacho says you juice 1 large tomato and 1 avocado peeled and pitted along with 8-12 large fresh basil leaves.  I don't think you can juice an avocado.  Nor does the 3 ingredient gazpacho sound very good."

Between the wonderful storyline, the vividly detailed world, and the unforgettable characters - I couldn't put it down! The main character, Vincent, is especially captivating.  His wonderful sarcasm and sense of humor had me all too eager to follow him on his journey.The author, Kristopher Norris, is a truly amazing storyteller.  His characters are easy to relate to, and even easier to fall in love with.  I cannot wait for his next installment in this series.  For not only am I eager to find out what happens with our dear Vincent but also with the other wonderful characters as well!I highly recommend Blackjack to everyone and feel this author is definitely someone to keep an eye out for!!"
"05 1, 2014",B00E3KE91Y,5.0,Great series.,AZC84MZCL7C0Q,I absolutely love  this series. The characters were very interesting and the whole royal family was fascinating. The intrigue was very real.
"07 31, 2013",B00E3N0AAK,5.0,Awesome! Get this book. Get it now! A treacherous family saga!,A3685FII0CT06P,"Get this book. Get it now! I doubt you'll be disappointed. I love this series. Sultana: Two Sisters by Lisa J. Yarde continues the saga of the 14th Century Nasrid Dynasty begun with Sultana and Sultana's Legacy. It is a time of harsh realities, blood baths, and political turmoil. In this, the third novel of this fascinating series, set during the reign of Sultan Abdul Hajjaj Yusuf I of Granada, two women become deadly enemies in the fight for supremacy. Butayna and Maryam vie for the heart of Sultan Yusuf, for whoever captures his love and bears his son, will likely rule the harem.It is obvious that author Lisa J. Yarde has done extensive research into the era. With vivid detail and expressive prose, she expertly brings the characters to life with all their faults and qualities, emotions and aspirations. The characters always surprise the reader, for their unpredictability and ever changing motivations. As I read and learned more about the two women at the heart of the story, I clearly understood the dangerous times they lived in and what motivated them to do what they did. Through the eyes of these two women, the reader is swept into feelings of lost love, mystery, hardships faced by the characters, betrayal, bitterness, passionate love and forgiveness. The author has a lovely writing style, simple, unencumbered, but beautiful in description and spirit. The characters are complex and with plenty of conflict in their pasts to capture the reader's interest and hold it to the end. To keep the era as authentic as possible, the author does not sugar-coat any of the brutality or realities of the times.It is a story about the choices one makes during a moment in time and the impact it will have on one's future. There is plenty to contemplate and identify with along with the two women at the heart of the story. A deeply evocative story with plenty of passion to keep you turning the pages long into the night. The Sultana series of novels overflow with intrigue, murder, betrayal, sabotage, treachery, treason, and plenty more. Although they can be read independently of each other, I recommend you begin at the beginning and not miss any of the excitement."

"09 11, 2013",B00E5MRF66,4.0,Great Read,A1YZ4FP8H9AV6I,"This story is a well detailed disaster novel.  Each character can easily be distinguished from the others.  The plots moves along smoothly with a few scenes for background information.The only complaint I have is the repeated use of the word ""span"" instead of ""spun.""  Span is the distance between objects where as spun means to spin and object.  From the sentences in the novel it was obvious the author intended ""spun"" but used ""span.""  Other words had similar problems such as of vs off.Other than that the book is excellent and enjoyable reading even though it is a bit depressing."

I was hesitant at first because I'm not a big fan of self-help books but I fell in love with them right away. Bella has such a wonderful narrative voice so they were more like reading a story than a factual beauty guide for women over 40. Her writing is fascinating, educational and entertaining all at the same time. I have learned so much about targeted skin care and general health care for us (can I say middle age?) women from her and have incorporated much of what I have learned into my own life. On the surface her books may appear light and airy but there are really important truths embedded in them, truths about what it I really must do to maintain a healthy, younger looking me that feels great!"
"08 1, 2013",B00E8901R6,5.0,Why Can't these Characters be Real???,A1XAMU4XEKZZH9,"This is the third time I've started typing out this review, THIRD TIME!! I am still at a loss for words in how to talk about this, what is in my opinion the BEST BOOK in Jenn Cooksey's fantastic Grab Your Pole series.My love for Jenn started nearly a year ago when she approached me and asked me to review her new book, Shark Bait. I was a bit nervous, I don't read indie books. (Or I didn't.) But it took only two pages to have me hooked. I read it one sitting, and it remains one of four books I have ever re-read (another being her second book, The Other Fish in the Sea) and I have to say it remains one of my top ten books EVER. And now? Shark Out of Water may have bumped Shark Bait a little farther down on the list.She ended TOFitS with a MASSIVE cliffhanger. Most of my Bookish friends, myself included, shared a love/hate relationship with Jenn for the past few months as we anxiously awaited SOoW's release. (Of course I can't even talk about the cliffhanger without spoiling these books, and they are books I definitely do NOT want to spoil!!)Now, Shark Out of Water may be my favorite book. I don't just mean of the series.  (And that says a lot from a person who reads 125+ books per year!) It's real. It's Raw. It's funny. It's heartbreaking. I can honestly say I was on an emotional roller coaster for the five hours it took me to read this one. (Yes, I timed myself... I'm admittedly a dork.) And I loved every minute of it. There were times I debated putting it down, so that I wouldn't finish it.(I know this isn't much of a review - but again, I just can't spoil this one!)This book is from the guys perspective - and let me tell you? Jenn does a fabulous job of hopping inside a teenage boys mind! (I even called my husband and read some of this one to him, and he agreed that he could see himself as a teen thinking these things.) And I have to say - she does an excellent job of winning the readers back after the horrible thing she did to us in TOFitS!Now, I do have to say - there isn't a major cliffhanger in the end. (Which I ADORE her for!) Although there is a major plot line - that I pretty much always knew was coming - that she leaves unresolved. I consider that a cliffhanger, but I thank her for giving me a few more months to live in hopeful suspense that she will have some mercy for this character. (But I'm certain she won't - as she's said multiple times, these books are real. And real isn't always pretty!)Do I recommend this one? YES!! But, it's incredibly important you start from the beginning of this series. Give these characters time to become real, to become friends. Give this story line a chance to take a place in your soul, it will grab hold and it will NOT let go."

In some areas, it definitely is!  The author's personality comes through like a beacon allowing the reader to feel as if a good friend has stopped by.However, the information about how to help yourself stabilize in the face of being unemployed is very valuable.  The author clearly has been down this path and is a competent guide in assisting the reader to protect their assets.The author touches on how to lower mortgage payments, car payments, how to find out what governmental assistance you are eligible for, and most importantly things not to do now that you're recently unemployed.Not only does this book delve into the practical dollars-and-sense advice, it goes into some detail about the social ramifications of being unemployed and how to navigate those waters.All of this advice is delivered in the author's inimitable direct layman's tone (with high brow literary references sprinkled throughout).If you're looking for a primer on what to do when you lose your job this book will definitely help you."

Appalling in that a child could be treated so unkindly, even by his mother, because isn't it said that &#34;only a mother could love that face&#34;. But his mother didn't love his face or him, she only tolerated him. Impelling that said child could be so ready to survive with so much adversity. Intriguing in the fact that with all things against him he could stay healthy  of mind and become a person that I wanted to get to know. I want to find out more about his life, and what he has to encounter as an adult, &#34;in the REAL WORLD&#34;. Fascinating story. Can't wait for the rest of the story.

Wondering if anyone else feels this way, he confides in his teacher, Mark, who is also sensitive to the energy emitting from the building. As they search for answers for strange occurrences, they get attacked by strange shadow people linked to the mysterious dead benefactor to Darkridge Hall himself- Adrian Darkridge. Time runs out to find out what is causing all this craziness which seems to have more and more to do with the recent murders in the area. Reality and the supernatural collide in this epic, spine chilling thriller!If you're aching to get your heart thumping and some adrenaline surging, this is a story to indulge in.

"11 5, 2013",B00EDZYRJS,5.0,Amazing,A3BKJYAJCE9GK4,"Brooke Anderson's live-in boyfriend is as nice as they come. He's polite, he opens car doors for her, and he even brings her coffee every morning. Unfortunately, both the brew and the man are weak, uninspiring and boring. What she's really looking for is a brew that reaches out, grabs her by the shoulders and shakes her into consciousness&#8212;and a man who matches this potency.Marshall, the powerful but older CEO-type she meets in her building's workout room, excites her, but Brooke can only push the snooze on her biological alarm clock for a limited time or her dreams of a family will be dashed. And there's Jack, the intense and handsome senior partner at her company whose passion for food, wine, and music is infectious, and whose delightfully kinky sexuality promises to rock Brooke&#8217;s world. But he's married. And he could easily become her boss.Jack Walsh has obsessed over the pretty young manager in his Chicago consulting firm&#8217;s logistics department since the day she transferred from the Denver office, and when they collaborate on a high-profile project, her proximity awakens a passion for life and living that he hasn't felt in years. He&#8217;s prepared to shed a wife and joust a boyfriend to win her attention, though she could be too young for him and too innocent for his proclivities.But passion isn&#8217;t fueled by angst or discovered through logic. It is a product of the separate fantasies, foibles and feelings of human beings that, when combined, generate mind-blowing emotion, off-the-charts sensations and unparalleled sexuality. Book one of the Intense series reveals the life events that have made Brooke and Jack who they are and what they need. Now we get to watch as they discover themselves and explore each other in the pursuit of Intense Passions.I loved this book. Kalen Laurel did a fantastic job making me feel for the main characters and experience their desires. I particularly enjoyed that she gave me, the reader, insight into their pasts and why they have the passions they do. She drew me in and made me want to know more about Brooke and Jack. Especially when the two of them are trying to navigate their way through their work relationship and eventually come to terms with their attraction to each other. Very detailed erotic read....highly recommend this book and I can't wait until the next one comes out.Brooke is living a boring ordinary life with her boyfriend, Karl. Karl is a nice guy but set in his ways and his routines. Brooke wants and needs more. She wants to go out and experience life. She feels a strange thing between her and Marshall. Marshall is an older man who lives in her apartment building. She sees him when she goes to workout in the gym. Brooke feels him staring at her and she can't help herself from taking longing looks at him. But she thinks to herself, he is much older and if she wants a family he probably isn't going to want the same thing.Jack is married and although he loves his wife, it isn't the kind of love it should be. Yes she is beautiful and intelligent but Jack misses the passion. He wants to be with someone who has the same passions he does. Someone who he can treat like a princess and take control over in the bedroom. He believes he has found that in Brooke. The way she reacts to him and the things he days to her give him hope that she is exactly what he is missing. They grow closer when they have to work on a big project at work. But Jack is adamant that they both are single and free before taking their relationship to the next level.Together they both are experiencing the passion of music and food. Brooke loves feeling like a princess and having Jack take care of her. Jack is enthralled with watching Brooke as she first experiences the opera and new foods. He finds himself falling in love with her, as Brooke falls in love with him. Can they make this work both in the boardroom and bedroom? Will Marshall become more than a friend? Can Brooke decide between the two of them?"

Conner and Abbie is the cutest and sweetest couple. They are very sexual and open. Their best friends are just as open as they are.

"10 9, 2013",B00EESY9VU,4.0,Great package all wrapped in one story!!,AC27M84VNURSE,"I received an ARC in exchange for an honest review.The main character Delia has been in an institute for the past ten years due to an incident she claims she did not do. On her release day she meets gorgeous Liam. They immediately clicked and started talking; but when they open up about each other it kind of broke my heart a little. Two people who have secrets of their own find each other, think about the little adventure that you will find when you open up this book. I loved Delia from the beginning, she didn't sugar coat anything especially what she thought or said. I love a book with twists and the author throws you a twist in this which set met back and I had to go and re-read it just to make sure I read it correctly (definitely was not a bad thing to re-read it just wanted to make sure I was actually not having mind games being played) lol.What choices do you think Delia and Liam will do and how far will they go to find out the truth behind their secrets? I am letting you know this book is well worth the read and you will not regret what the author has done with it. I have read other books by Ms. Kight  and she truly shows that she has the ability to write various stories and each have their own finds within.Although I enjoyed the book I didn't want it to end the way it did but the author did what was best for the characters which in my books is what makes it worth, and I do hope that there may be another book to this one. Keep your pitchforks and everything out of sight you will understand as I did on why the ending ended the way it did. I would like to know of what Delia's next adventures will be.I encourage you to read this book and find out about the secrets, lies, tragedy and how one girl grows stronger by it and learns to move on. Thank you to the Author for bringing another great novel to us!"

"01 27, 2014",B00EFZRZ18,5.0,Not Just For The Birds,AUEATM6VYQAIH,"'Where Love Takes You' is the sequel to Ms Scarberry's novella about Henry the pigeon, and for this outing she has a co-writer, Francis Potts.This is a cozy, romantic tale with which to curl up in front of the fire on a cold night.It concerns the life-choices of two American women who fall for British men. All are pigeon lovers, and we learn a bit about pigeon-racing along the way.It will likely appeal more to the American reader than to the British reader, since the quaint English expressions which so perplex the two ladies will be already familiar to those of us from this side of the Pond, hence we do not get to join in the 'joy of discovery'. Some of the travels around the various towns and sights, and details of British food, will also be well-known to many Brits who might be tempted to skim a few passages.The book is, however, well put together and the storyline unfolds patiently and sensitively. It would be difficult not to like the characters and to root for them - especially the hopeless romantics among us.So get yourself a mug of cocoa (or your preferred poison) and grab a copy of 'Where Love Takes You'. While it might lack the drama of the first book, parts of it will have you reaching for the tissues."

Each book deals with different characters who are either related, friends or through serendipity have been thrown together.In this first installment we follow the lives of Tony Walters and Nikki Wilkes.  They are both in their fifties and looking for a second chance in life at love.This is a non-conventional love story.  After so many years the two of them are rusty at the art of dating and romance.  It is very entertaining to see to what lengths Tony goes to build up his nerve to ask Nikki out.  The love affair is something to write home about.  These two people who have denied themselves the pleasures of the flesh for so long are not wasting any time.  While reading these scenes, I could not help but wonder who would have the heart attack first... the characters or myself.  Turn your fans on and cool down before reading these scenes.  Either that or keep plenty of ice on hand."

And all thedifferentnways one could choose to do the challenges that he presented at the end of each day as this was how he set up his book. I felt impacted from the subjects he chose to show many ways there are to be generous to otther  people ;those we may know and those we may not know but whom we could make a difference in their lives-especially in love, God's Love that is. I am doing this and another one on Goodreads for CJ and Shelley Hitz in exchange for them giving me a free book ,see? Thanks CJ and Shelley Hitz!  I recommend this book for those who wish to or may need to learn how to be generous more often than they may be now to those who are in need, or where their being generous could spill over  on others and even put some individuals in shock that there is indeed kind people out here in this often cruel world.  I give CJ five stars on account of all that I have already outlined above. Great Book with great challenges to be sought after. Angela L."
"08 21, 2013",B00EJWZV8Q,5.0,wonderful historical romance,A1VDPNB08TAP8F,"Two words. ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC! Kate Rothwell (Author) has written a wonderful historical romance novel about friendship, love, guilt and death. Love Between The Lines [Kindle Edition] is a very heartwarming story with great characters. You can hardly put the book down!! Happy feel good read!! I love the cover photo. Made me want to jump right inside the story!! This had enough sub-plots to make it interesting and the characters were well developed. I am always looking for books like this with a suspenseful story and good romance without all the explicit details. I thought the story was very well-developed and the characters were very likable."
"03 4, 2014",B00EJXIO7U,4.0,Magic MIrror: a Parisian Mystery (Georgia Lee...,A1IR5KJLOOAYAM,"This is an excellent mystery. The characters were well-developed and each one played an important role in the story. There were plenty of twists and turns in the plot that kept me guessing. The ending was not what I expected, which is a good thing. Mystery lovers will enjoy this book."
"04 22, 2014",B00EKJ1ZR4,5.0,Great Bed Time Read-Aloud Adventure,A202CZ4PJH83G4,"As a child, I was absolutely crazed for the CHOOSE-YOUR-OWN-ADVENTURE series and the like, buying every one of them at the monthly book fairs. Of course, over time, my tastes ""matured"" towards Steve Jackson's battle books and Infcom's seminal text-based adventures, but even to this day, a great many moons later, I have the fondest memories of me and my best friend in 6th grade sitting down together with our haul of pick-a-path books and devouring them.SAM AND LIZA GO TO THE BEACH is aimed for a younger readership than those pick-a-path books of the late 70s and early 80s, written with some literary depth that will suit a confident 6 or 7 year old reader when alone.  The Kindle formatting is easy on the eyes, the vibrant section pictures appropriate to the scenes, the paths interlooping and varied, the heading home ending a restful stop.  While I was reading,  I was struck with how an appropriate read-aloud book this would be for preschool, giving the child interaction and a satisfying end that can lend itself easily to the child's own night time conclusion.  The kiss, the wish for a good sleep, the lights out as the child snuggles under the covers, dreaming about their own possible beach side adventures.And speaking as an ancient fan of this style of interactive books, I can think of no better way to really get a child keen on the mental explorations inherent in books than pick-a-paths adventures.  I hope the eBook market for them truly flourishes."
"11 23, 2013",B00EKSV9CQ,4.0,Enjoyable,AN3SSTS24R3EJ,"Enjoyed all three stories in this set.  It is for those who enjoy a good romance story.  Once started, read all three within a couple of days."
"08 19, 2013",B00EM9KUZU,5.0,Couldn't put it down!,A9EJOIDGRHNNQ,"I had the opportunity to be a beta reader for this wonderful book, but wanted to buy the finished product and read it again.  Couldn't put it down.  I've been a Mel Comley fan since I first read Cruel Justice, and so far I've not been disappointed with any book I've read.  However, I do believe this is my favorite.Ellen Brazil leaves behind the police force to open a missing person's bureau with her partner, a computer geek that will make you smile. Although no longer a police officer, she still has access through her brother, Jim. Hired to find a missing woman, Ellen soon finds herself embroiled in a series of missing women--all of whom could have been sisters. With the help of her brother and Brian's computer's skills Ellen tracks down every lead. Will she be able to stop him and find the girls he's kidnapped, or will she become one of his victims?One of my favorite things about Ms. Comley's writing is her ability to bring the characters to life through family and friends. Well plotted, well written and a real page-turning read. I loved it. Here's hoping this series has a long life as I'm looking forward to the next book already."
"08 26, 2013",B00EN167EK,5.0,Great Insight Into The Dating Game,A1ZDARQYYBN9WO,"If you are looking for tips on the dating game, or even if you would just like to experience it from a safe distance, this book is for you. The author is a matchmaker who has made a living setting up clients over lunch. Although her clientele (real names changed to protect the innocent and guilty) tends to be high brow (not surprising, as I'm guessing you need some serious moolah to be able to afford a professional matchmaker) the common dating situations they find themselves in are universal. Each chapter is an individual lunch date in which the highs and lows of the date are explained and Krista gives her commentary on what went right and what can be improved. Some of the stories are funny, others sad, and still others just plain bizarre. What unites them all though is that they are all interesting. This is a quick and enjoyable read that you will likely enjoy."

"10 2, 2013",B00ENVYVHA,3.0,If there was a 3.5 star I'd give that,A187T3UVAJJI3X,"This was good, it wasn't poor...but it seemed to drag, more than once.

"04 24, 2014",B00EO3H5UC,3.0,"Interesting Plot, shallow emotions",AOAAX92CVVC1M,"There were many positives as well as negatives about this book.Positives:1) The story's plot was interesting. You wanted to know what was going to happen. Really wanted to know.2) The fight scenes were engaging and descriptive, unlike some books I could mention... it seemed to describe real action.3) The historical blended well with the fictional aspect and made things intriguing. I felt like I learned things I didn't know before about that section of the war.4) It was nice to have Christian values and concepts brought into a novel.Negatives:1) The plot felt forced in quite a few areas. Why did Dane make a troublemaker Russian stay with them. There was no &#34;have to&#34; here.. it felt like it was contrived to give tension to the book, not like it was something that could be avoided.2) While the actions were realistic, the emotional aspect was shallow. It felt like all the characters said and did what the author wanted them to.... like they were puppets on a string being jerked around this way and that for the story's sake... like it wasn't really them, just emotions pasted onto cardboard figures. It felt fake, fake, fake.3) I really didn't care for the amount of lust and leering and graphic descriptions of the russian mistreating the main girl character. I felt like that was thrown in for ... modernity's sake? It would have been better without all that... or only 5% of it.4) While I appreciated the Christian concepts discussed and the gospel presentation, this also felt like it was slapped on and shallow. Don't get me wrong, I am a Christian and hold dearly to my beliefs, but this came across like the author thought &#34;Oh, right, need to make them believe certain ways by the end of the story&#34;.... slap on shallow corny conversation .... I felt like ... the &#34;converts&#34; fell for everything too quickly and did &#34;what they were supposed to&#34; without seeing a deep change... just switching out the &#34;unsaved&#34; for &#34;saved&#34; sign hanging around their neck.  And it was a little much to have us see the Russian in hell, screaming for all of eternity.....So, to sum it up, the plot is interesting and informative, but the character's are shallow - emotionally and spiritually. This could be a really good book - after it was edited and tightened up a couple notches."
"08 28, 2013",B00EOXPCZM,2.0,Powerpoint Vampire,ASYP0F2859IS9,"I downloaded this one with high hopes for a new vampire mythology, but it was such a disappointment. The Blood Vivcanti Part 1 reads like a series of bullet points from the POV of Becket's new vampire variant. What happened to SHOW not TELL? I felt like I was attending a business seminar entitled ""Introducing the Blood Vicanti."""
"07 10, 2014",B00EPE3XWE,4.0,"The phantom crew scampered like rats amidst the twisting configuration of bone, meat and guttle",AXIO51VZN815F,"Book grabbed my attention with this opening passage &#34;The U-boat was helpless. We could have ordered their surrender, but we weren't in the mood for any kind of mercy.&#34; Then book shifts from one of historical fiction to the supernatural as the protagonist offers his life for another one lost complete with a macabre ending.

My heart fell for Cathy, Ben, and Arsen. I wanted to hate Cathy for what she did to Ben, but the mind is so fragile that we don't know what can make a person snap. In this story, Cathy was so far gone emotionally, and on a self destructive path that she could not see clearly of her actions.  I don't really like triangles cause they are messy, and everyone involved gets hurt. I loved this story it's so raw and real. I can't wait to read another book by Mia Asher."

Very, very creative. Each of the children has an animal last name and it totally fits them and their personalities. I loved how supportive Waldon's mom was, totally standing up for him. This story was a lot of fun and was very funny. Absolutely darling. My daughter loved to spend time looking at each page and studying the pictures and she especially loved reading about all the different bears at the end of the story. This one is definitely another hit!**I received a copy in exchange for an honest review**"

"08 31, 2013",B00ERF3INA,5.0,GOOD BOOK!,A861H3BQWL687,"This was a good book.  Sterling and Blair met under funky circumstances but were meant to be together.  Both were products of abuse and both of them had their individual scars.  But, one of the two was able to still show love and in turn, teach the other what love actually means in every essence.  Both characters had their faults, one more than the other.  Sterling was an ass plain and simple, Blair was strong but yet naive at times, in a way they balanced each other.  Each of them had to learn to trust each other as well as themselves, and in the end, it proved to be worth it.  The more I read about Shadow when she was young and living on the streets, I believe that she was a child prodigy raised to a certain point under an evil woman.  I would love to learn and find out the whole story regarding Shadow and exactly who are her parents and who is Paradise to King Heart!!"

Please do not let the fact there is no &#8220;sex&#8221; in the story deter you from reading.

It was such an emotional roller coaster. How much pain and loss can one person take before it breaks them. There were moments in the story that Alex shared with her Papa that brought back similar memories of my grandfather and I giving the story a personal connection. I was hoping that Alex would find peace and more than anything happiness.As time passes and life happens, Alex is always haunted by memories of Drew.

Don&#8217;t try and fight our destiny &#8211;&#8220; ~ DrewNot much more can be said about the AMAZING story without giving away too much. I read this book in one day because honestly it was an emotional train wreck and I just couldn't tear myself away. The pain was just that good. All I can say is that this story left me unable to read for a few days after finishing and even a few more days before I was able to write this review."
"11 27, 2013",B00F8Z2C9O,4.0,Hot Damn,A916DXE9W36GF,"This was a great introduction to Katie Reus&#8217; new series The Serafina: Sin City. I really liked Hayden and Sierra. They had great chemistry and a really great friendship prior to the lovers part. It was great how they were finally forced together and made to actually think about how they felt about each other. How they were able to hold out for a year, especially when they had a standing date with each other every Thursday, I will never figure out. As soon as Sierra was attacked they couldn&#8217;t deny it any longer.Hayden is perfect book boyfriend material. I wish I had more time with him. I&#8217;m not sure how Sierra didn&#8217;t melt into a pile of goo every time he opened his mouth. He was a little rough around the edges, but so incredibly sweet, especially when he talked to her about her insecurities. And Sierra, for being as successful as she was, it was nice to see that she was still vulnerable and insecure.I look forward to reading more in this series and going back and checking out Katie&#8217;s Red Stone Security series. I&#8217;m intrigued by Iris especially and her relationship with Wyatt. Katie definitely has me hooked.Arc provided by the publisher via Netgalley"
"10 4, 2013",B00F9B0PDC,4.0,Slave to Passion,A2R7C9H41T6W9S,I enjoyed The Estate but I appreciated Slave to Passion even more. Both books were high on stream. But The Estate left me wanting in the connections department. It was more erotica where Slave to Passion read like romantica. The story and the connection between Hunter and Madison were present and accounted for. I liked that the authors established that connection between them before they even visited the estate. Hunter *sigh* broke down Madison's walls with seductive persistence.
"10 30, 2013",B00F9WR8ZO,5.0,MUST READ!!!!,A3QFZA43063MYN,"I went into this book with high expectations and high hopes because I know that I LOVED the first book Luna Sanguis. And I was not disappointed!!! I planned to read this book over a few weeks period of time. But, with planning a wedding, work, two boys, two dogs, and two blogs, I ended up waiting until the beginning of this week before even starting it. But, it didn't matter. I finished this book in one sitting! I was so tired the next day for work but it was worth it!!I loved that this book picks up right where the last book left off. Poor Delicate Rose is so broken and pitiful. She is lost in her own mind from a traumatic event she witnessed and is now confined to a loony bin. She knows there is something bigger for her out there; Eternal. However, an ancient evil is bound and determined to drain her of her very powerful blood so he can become eternal himself. In order to stop this, her true love must kill the evil and stop him before it is too late.Can we say a roller coaster ride?!? There is so much emotional turmoil. But of course, there are vampires, erotica, and plenty of madness. I recommend to read this book be read in order. If not, you will be lost!!Very good job Okill for another fantastic addition!!! LOVED IT!!!!!"
"10 12, 2013",B00FA0SCM8,2.0,Didn't like it.,A25X25O0QYLLKN,The characters didn't like each other and I didn't like them either. The story was a downer with no redeeming lightness to offset the darkness. The romance was odd.

"10 1, 2013",B00FCWAGNC,5.0,Amazing Novella,A2ETTCN0R9DPY1,"Tegan Ash is set to marry to get her green card.  When the groom backs out at the last minute his best friend,Jamie MacCreadie volunteers.

"11 25, 2013",B00FD3ASBU,3.0,Quick start,A2Z9B6YNWSN168,I am interested to see where the rest of this short series goes. Julie and Dominic came together so quickly with no challenges or knowing Julie's limits.
"01 8, 2014",B00FD64RL4,4.0,An emotional rollercoaster,A2XG09JLKW692V,"In the early 80&#8217;s, Sarah and Emerson fell in love, and then Sarah fell out of love. Now years later, Emerson and Sarah live hours apart, but when Sarah&#8217;s life hits a bump or two, which seems to happen often, a call to her best friend Emerson helps her get through the day. While their relationship is beneficial for Sarah, poor Emerson is stuck hiding his unrequited feelings from Sarah for fear of losing her forever.Sarah&#8217;s life drama only gets worse when she runs into big trouble with her job and her drug dealing boyfriend. When she reaches her breaking point and has no idea what she is going to do, Emerson shows up on her doorstep like a knight in shining armor to rescue her.  Taking the opportunity to start all over, Sarah heads to Syracuse with Emerson and his roommate Rashid. Once in her new home Sarah is going to have to get serious about growing up before she hurts any more of the people she loves.Sliding Past Vertical is an emotional rollercoaster. Author Laurie Boris has no qualms with making her readers&#8217; hearts ache and then their blood boil all within a couple of pages. Her ability to manipulate our emotions is in large part due to her carefully crafted characters.  It&#8217;s easy to get wrapped up in their drama and connect with them on a deep level.  I enjoyed watching all of the characters as they battled with their pasts and tried desperately to carve out a future that would allow them to be happy productive people.While the character development was excellent and the plot was quite compelling, I felt the ending went way too fast. There was so much lead into this crucial moment for all of the characters that I felt when it finally occurred, it was over in a blink. I wanted that moment slowed down and for each of the characters to simmer in the role they played or didn&#8217;t play, before they started to figure out how to move on.Don&#8217;t let that one small criticism slow you down from giving this great book a read. If you are a fan of character studies about everyday people struggling to connect with other people and find their place in the world then Sliding Past Vertical is the book for you.(This book was provided to Compulsion Reads by the author for review.)"

A little while later that evening she runs into him with his daughter Penny. Penny insists Lee join them for dinner on Christmas. The dinner turns out to be close to disastrous but what develops between the two lost and lonely adults and a precocious little girl is anything but. The author has captured the spirit of Christmas we all want to feel--the love of a family and the warmth of a wish come true. I'll be reading this one every year during the holidays from now on.

"10 5, 2013",B00FHREXVI,4.0,Action-Packed and Wonderfully Written,A2GU8WAUL1GREZ,"From the very first scene, Clarke creates a world of mystery, action, and suspense that grabs hold of you and drags you forward into this twisting ride of a novel. The Jonas Trust Deception is one of the first thrillers I've ever read that wasn't packed with cliches, stock characters, and hackneyed plot turns. Sure, there were a few cheesy moments, but on the whole, Clarke made the genre more appealing to me than it has ever been. He managed to pack in a wealth of cultural references and allusions that display an impressive intelligence, and he was able to construct an engaging narrative through his ability to create scenes so real you could practically touch them.More importantly, he doesn't just tell the reader things. Clarke shows the story in a beautifully crafted way. From romantic liaisons to dramatic shoot-outs, this book does more than entertain, it intoxicates. I found myself making promises to myself to only read one more chapter, but then a cliffhanger would draw me to the next page, or a mysterious intruder with unknown intentions would seduce me into reading for just a few more minutes.My only critique would be some of the inner monologue narrative, which seemed slightly forced, or taken straight out of a movie from the 1980s. Clarke is an extremely talented writer, and the story flows wonderfully, but some of the sections seemed overwritten. All in all, this is a genuinely thrilling novel, and one that you'll tear through in a matter of days, probably because you won't be able to put it down."
"11 30, 2013",B00FIC0R12,3.0,An ok read,A2HDWQIUT687YA,"The characters are likeable and it's a fun read. Things seem to fall into place pretty easily for all involved and some of the decisions made seem odd as well. The character development seems like it could use some work as there doesn't seem to be any great shock to their changed circumstances and they just go on as if no big deal, but it's an inexpensive book and entertaining escape just seems like more could have been done to make the story grittier and more realistic."
"11 1, 2013",B00FICOGZK,4.0,crash and burn,A3AGY3G6ZXTTK8,"Crash and BurnBy Chelsea Camaron4/5I picked this book because I liked the cover; I didn't read any blurb, just jumped straight in.This is a prequel story for a series of books, so I thought yeah I'm starting at the right point, however I was not prepared for what I was about to read.Dina is young at college an only child, and when her parents are killed in an accident, she has no family left, her best friend Maggie and her brothers and parents are as close to a family as she has got, she is totally devastated by this traumatic event, and closes downs and shuts everyone out, even when Maggie gets a steady boyfriend and she wants her to meet him and his room mate, she still shy's away.Then she literally bumps in Michael, who seem just too good to be true, Michael has a very evil side that he has kept hidden.Dina does not pick up on any warning signs, in what Michaels not only says to her but in the way he gradually exerts control over her, its only when she decides to meet up with Maggie and her boyfriend and not tell Michael, that his true side comes out.This book truly had me shouting at it, wanting to smash my kindle in frustration, I wanted to take a baseball bat to Michael (2 wrongs don&#8217;t make a right I know but it would have felt good) I also wanted to give Dina a good hard shake and tell her to wake up, this is not love, however as with life, you cant help anyone until they want to help them self's.I found this book emotional to read , I've known women in Dinas situation, I was only going to start it but read until the end, Dinas mental processes of rationalization were frustrating to say the least, this is not a hearts and flowers story,"

One thing I noticed right away is that Tessa can write the male voice very well.  She can also write witty banter that is both funny and entertaining.  The characters, both the main and the supporting, were well written. Brent and Hayden were an unlikely couple that ended up being perfect for each other.The book is a little on the short side.  I also would have like a little more story in my book which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5."

"10 21, 2013",B00FL0ELZO,4.0,Emotional ride!,AR6SCQAD2XGTZ,"This was quite a love story. You have a woman who bases her judgment of the man meant for her on a letter left to her by her nana on settling for someone who is 60% as Nana says there is no one out there to make your heart go pittypat, no one who will give you tingles, it's better to settle for a ""good"" man. You have her mother who is NO kind of mother at all (who chooses a mean man over her own kid? Her mom DISGUSTS me). And you watch as Brielle is seemingly about to ruin her life.He's married, she's engaged, and it all started with a swift kick to the head, literally. You will run the gamut of emotions while reading this book. I went from disgusted to frustrated to hopeful to pining to annoyed to angry to heart-aching to heart-wrenching to hopeful...it just doesn't stop! There's a HEA somewhere in this story, but you'll have to read to find out as I don't want to give away a thing! :)Thank you to the publishers and author for an early review copy.

"12 29, 2013",B00FR6SGOY,4.0,Anxious to see where this will go,A10C5RP21MQYT6,"Okay, where to start.....I'll start with this book was 3.5 stars for me. It was a good book, but had some flaws that made it hard for me to really enjoy it.Beware- spoilerishThe biggest thing I didn't understand was why the F this kid stayed with Phillip or went back to him, despite other events that pulled them together. She seemed so intelligent except for every second she interacted with that douchbag. He was obviously bipolar, but she seemed confused by it, at times. He would be loving to her one second and then full on verbally abuse her, sometimes physically abuse her the next. I know she had been with him a long time, but what the f? He was a cheater, an abuser and an overall prick. Every second she was away from him, she was a very like able character. Every second she was with him, I wanted to roll my eyes on an endless loop. I get being with someone you shouldnt, but once Jaxson entered her life, that should have made her realize Phillip was a psycho piece of crap.I love Jaxon. He's obviously been through a lot, but he's clearly a different person, until little Courtney pushes him back to the dark side. I can't wait to read the second book to see where this all goes. I don't get what Jaxson's connection is with making Courtney his new Heather, but I'm sure we'll find out. What's a little frustrating though is that her being so similar to Heather is what draws him in, but what else? Other than that, what else is this 17-year-old girl offering this significantly older man? I hope more than it seems, otherwise being attracted to her because of a deceased girl from his past is a tad sick.I also want to be honest and say that this book felt a little long to me. It's not like I like short books, trust me, I appreciate details and great plots filled with twists and turns. It didn't feel that way here, it felt a little drawn out.That said, I will definitely be reading the second book to see where it goes."

I really liked the main character, Matthew Jester.I thought the author did an excellent job in creating this character, down to the smallest detail.  Matthew was a great guy who handled even intense situations with just the right amount of sarcasm and humor to make me like him a lot.The author did a great job of mixing mystery, humor, suspense and a mafia thriller all into one high octane read.

I will definitely continue reading books by her. I really enjoy her writing style, character development and stories themselves. They are real, full of emotion, tension and heat. I can't wait for the next one."
"07 5, 2014",B00FYIYK1S,4.0,Different twist in the series,A1W48IWJ8A610S,"Fox shifter Talia London wants anything but to deal with the bridezilla who is marrying her brother. For whatever reason her brother has blinders on when it comes to his future bride and as she continues to bully Talia, Talia decides she needs a break. Meeting Ford Wylde is a distraction and while she i snot a one night stand type of gal, she quickly realizes he is her mate.Ford was burned once before and he has made it his mantra to never get in another relationship again. When he meets Talia he knows she is his, he wants to trust her and as their relationship begins to blossom he knows she is the perfect match. However when his ex returns Ford is not sure how to react, but the one thing that is clear his mate always comes first.This one is quite different then the other in the series. Ford is probably the thinker out of all the Wyldes and he allowed his feelings for his ex to make him bitter where women were concerned. I liked Talia, she was gutsy and a good mate to Ford."

This book does contain sexual scenes which are not YA, but the characters are basically high schoolers. The opening is their graduation. I did like the book on some levels, but again the characters were just YA and apparently still are in the next book from the description."

He explains what the market is all about and gives great advice. There is so much good information (more than I can remember for any length of time) in this book. Stock Market Investing is a great intro to both fundamental and technical investing. It teaches you the various calculations needed to determine different buy/sell triggers. This book also gives a nice high level overview of the various masters of investing different styles.

The story continues on from the first book. The sex scences were Hot Hot Hot. The author kept it interesting by creating new sex scences for the Dom's and the submissve to play out. I loved the suspense part it was even better than the first book. The story line kept me on the edge of my seat. waiting to see when the  bad guys would strike. There was plenty of action this time around also. The love between the three main characters grew and the ending tied everything up nicely. I would highly recommend for adult readers who are looking for a hot, sexy BDSM Story ."
"07 11, 2014",B00G4CN1HM,4.0,Lovely captivating read,A103M7E0BSFC83,"I was lucky to get a copy of this book from Barbara Samuel via Net Galley.This is book 1 of this series, so the ending leaves you waiting for the next book, maybe even panting for the next book!I can see why the author Lark O'Neal named this RANDOM, there is a lot of random things that happen to her. Take the beginning of the book, quite literally a car crashed through the restaurant where she works, now she's out of a job, but she's met this guy called Tyler from it. Now that was random.She has a lot to deal with through out this book, a lot of things! I was sat wondering, oh heck, things are running too smoothly, something is about to happen, and it did.Well written, well rounded, light read for me which I enjoyed"
"11 12, 2013",B00G4CN1HM,5.0,An engaging story that captivates the imagination and resonates with readers of similar experiences.,AWK6TP9DNUKOM,"An engaging story that captivates the imagination and resonates with readers of similar experiences.Oh my goodness, this poor girl Jess really has had one heck of an avalanche of tragedy after tragedies touch her life in this one so the title is very fitting. I was genuinely impressed with the story telling in this book. It flowed well and I enjoyed hanging out in Jess&#8217; head throughout it. I just felt really sorry for her losses and felt like if she took one more hit, she might just fall over and curl into a fetal position from the pressure. I know I would! I really could relate with her money worries and uncertainties of what to do with her life.Jess is trying to make her way through life on a meager waitress salary after growing up without her mother, but can&#8217;t catch a break. One day, a car comes pummeling through the diner she works at and sends one of her best friends to the hospital, makes her lose her job and good pay, but she also meets dreamy Tyler, who has more secrets in his trust fund past than she could even imagine. As she tries to find another job, unravel her feelings on love with an abusive boyfriend and the blossoming feelings with Tyler, can she make it through without someone else dropping dead or something else &#8216;randomly&#8217; happening to her?Jess is pretty grounded for having endured so much in her short life and I like how strong and yet nave she still is. Really enjoyed this one but it does leave off at the end with loose ends so do expect to be reading a series for this isn&#8217;t a standalone novel. I can&#8217;t wait to read the next one, but I do hope Jess catches a break for once.I received an ARC of this story via Netgalley for an honest review."
"12 11, 2013",B00G4I4I5U,5.0,Good Read,A3P4DI7QHIVAE6,In the beginning it was Slow but this Story I loved it! But I need more Please part 2 Soon
"01 7, 2014",B00G5QOASQ,4.0,An Hidden Agenda,A9FCO8RDJVABW,I enjoyed this book with a Russian Mob member who falls in love with an innocent young student. The story is slow to unfold but intriguing with the tidbits of information released to keep interest. I loved the secondary characters as the story develops they shine through with their habits and loyalty to Lauren. Mischa is the hunk who knows his place in the unpredictable society he lives in; and hopes Lauren will take her place by his side there. Others don't share his hopes and dreams and make life difficult. This book does have a CLIFFHANGER but the next book is out in a few weeks.It also needs serious editing as there are a lot of errors and not just grammatical and omitted letters. I did enjoy the book but the action after the prologue doesn't happen until midway into the story and the romance doesn't ignite until around that time too. It keeps your interest though until then with warm characterization and interesting dialogue as you become invested in whats to happen soon. I wonder if the tale had moved at a quicker pace would a second book  be necessary? I will find that answer soon when the next installment is released.
"01 20, 2014",B00G5SP6UU,5.0,Amazing!,A24GJ7V2M5INXD,"This is a love story that you don't see coming, these character have tons to overcome to be together and the whole time you just keep cheering them on.

The story has an engaging plot that is complete with strong supporting characters! Over 220 pages! I like how unique Katrina is and how comfortable she is. I like how Lyle was successful but had a failed relationship. It was great watching Lyle come out of his shell. This is an excellent IR romance that I strongly recommend! :)

"10 28, 2013",B00G799GVC,4.0,My teeth hurt is was so sweet!,A33W0RJ2CY0B6I,"All These Pieces of Me: It was sugar sweet, smokin' hot, tragically sad and the banter was sarcastically funny. All great and different emotions that in my opinion make for a good read.The idea of putting together such a tender love story intertwined with BDSM was an enigma to me. But it sort of, kind of, more than a little but not totally 100% worked.Our hero was no caveman-alpha-male, make you want to drop your pants the second he enters the picture. But he was in EVERY way a hero. Tender, chivalrous, attentive, caring, protective, who knows how to rock the bed...the kind of man that you wouldn't be ashamed to take home to momma (barring she never visits the Stables).Our heroine was broken. No doubt about that. Albeit cute as a button. The kind of character you want to stick in your pocket and carry with you. She was a little too accommodating for my tastes. Always the perfect little girlfriend and through most of the book it turned me off a little to her. But at the end when you finally learn her secret it makes a little more sense (just a little).The two of them together was...well...sweet.The author did a great job of setting up the supporting characters for their own books. And I'm looking forward to Ian's and hopefully even Austin's story.Why only 4 stars?I just plain ""liked"" it. I reserve 5 stars for books that leave me with a major hangover.I wish there would have been more of Emma's story in the beginning. More of an explanation to why she behaves like a little girl. It wasn't entirely explained and that left me to guess it has something to do with a mental lapse due to her tragedy. But even then her secret wasn't explained well enough. Maybe a few detailed flashbacks of her time ""before"" would have brought it together better. It almost seemed like the explanation of her time ""BEFORE"" was rushed and I was disappointed. I really wanted to connect with Emma and her pain but I was left with many questions.My second reason (and this is entirely my own preference) is that it was just barely the right side of unicorns and rainbows and I half expected our characters to go giddily skipping into the sunset. I prefer a little more drama. Perhaps a little more opposition. I'm afraid the only thing that kept me so interested was the anticipation of Emma's story (and the sexy parts).Third is I wish there had been a little more BDSM interaction. I mean if you're going to carry that theme in your book then CARRY IT, my friend. It wasn't bad or even a turn off (pun totally intended) it's just almost as if the BDSM lifestyle didn't entirely flow with our hero's character. He didn't really have a dominant personality, in fact the lifestyle didn't really suit him at all. It was almost as if the author had an agenda of bringing BDSM into a more realistic light but it almost seemed random in the book. I'm no expert, by ANY means and I'm sure FSOG totally shaped my opinion on how a dominant should behave, maybe even wrongly. With that said...I'm not sure I would have like it as much had that part been taken out.Would I recommend the book? Yes I would.Would I read it again? Probably not.Will I read another from this author? Yes. But if the second book is exactly like the first than I'd probably stop there. I wouldn't be opposed to an ARC if it headed my way (juuuust sayin')"

(A Laugh Out Loud Comedy Sequel)This book is the sequel to [=Dating In The Dark=] and again features Jason Harding, short of stature, and also short of self-esteem, as well as a host of characters, some of whom were also featured in the first book, but also introducing Neil, a psychotic relation of Jason's blind soon-to-be bride.This book tells the story up to and including the wedding, but the action is mainly set around the stag do, which is to be held in Liverpool.Jason still can't believe his luck in marrying Emma, who, though blind, is definitely the boss in this relationship.Jason's pals, Barry, Terry and Boris, along with Jerry and the aforementioned Neil, organise the stag do, and off they all go on an hilarious adventure - will Jason make it to the church on time?You'll have to read the whole story to find out."

"02 27, 2014",B00G82TUM8,3.0,"Okay story, steamy sex scenes",AUZ96COITGKE3,"Surrender My Love was my first read from Lisa Eugene. It's part of the Washington Memorial Hospital series, but can be read as a standalone. I thought this book had great elements with not great follow through. It was a little hard to get through at first, kinda slow-paced, but once it started picking up speed, I was fully engaged. I really enjoyed the whole murder mystery aspect of it. It was definitely suspenseful, but the chemistry (which I believe is one of the most important pieces in a romance) between the two main characters was just not there for me. Don't get me wrong Doctor Brad Markson can take my temperature any day, he was dominant, sexy, demanding, all traits that I look for in a leading man, but I didn't feel the love or the angst when him and Chloe were together.Surrender My Love was a good story, but lacking in some areas. I can recommend this if all you are looking for is hot, steamy sex. But if you are looking for a true romance kind of deal, I'm not 100% sure you will be satisfied here.*Copy provided by author in exchange for an honest review*"

"11 29, 2013",B00G8BQA1S,4.0,"&#10024;A charged, provocative and lip-licking good read!!&#10024;",A1O5BMIWBH4OG2,"My rating: 4 of 5 &#11088;&#65039;As an outlet for a recent loss and old demons toying with his peace of mind, Madewood heir and chef Neil Harrison blows off steam on his bike. When women and sex don't do the trick anymore, he turns to illegal street racing. Something he has been able to keep to himself, until Carson shows up at one of his races.Architect Carson Kelly is employed by Neil, building the Madewood Farm, a fine dining and event establishment on a gorgeous ten-acre property. Despite the obvious attraction, her relationship with Neil has always been rather confrontational. She has to be tough to prove herself in a male dominated world, especially after making some pretty devastating mistakes when she was younger. Her father, and owner of Kelly Designs, never let her forget.Which is exactly why she was there at the street race, trying to stop Neil from making the same stupid mistakes. Neil is intrigued with Carson's no bullshit attitude, not to mention the whole biker chick persona, but senses there is more at play here and is determined to find out more. When the two embark on a passionate affair, supposedly to distract Neil from the need to race they both put their professional lives in the scale.Before long family entanglements, personal insecurities and professional exposure catch up with Carson and Neil and their 'involvement' has become more involved than either of them had planned on.*****A short VERY spicy and compelling read!!The story hits the floor running. Right off the bat you jump into a backstory you have to catch up with, and you will.......give it a bit of time. I actually love stories that throw you right in the middle of the action, rather than slowly setting the scene.....this one, you get thrown in the deep end, so to speak. It keeps you engaged right from the start.It does mean that the characters are further along in their connection with each other than you may be ready for, but you have to allow for that in this type of set up. The context for each of the protagonists, and my connection with and understanding of them came eventually.For a relatively short story, each of the characters was well fleshed out. Neil obviously has fear, self esteem and trust issues, which are not surprising given his background. Believing you are deserving of something can be difficult to get your head around. Carson was fighting a losing battle, she could never become the son she thinks her father would have preferred, no matter how hard she strives to be the best Alpha she can be. She has to learn to fight for herself, for her own approval and love, not others'.Interesting about the dynamic between the two characters is the juggling for dominance at times. With Carson trying so hard to be seen and heard in a man's world, she has taken on a lot of the traits of a traditional Alpha and Neil is instinctively one, which makes for some fiery encounters.This was actually a story I would not have minded seeing spread out a little longer.....over more pages. I think there was still some room for exploration!!And what is it, about a hot and dominant man who knows his way around the kitchen that makes my panties melt???&#10024;A charged, provocative and lip-licking good read!!&#10024;**ARC provided in return for an honest review.**"

Rebecca and her quest to have a pool party or a  naked calendar is the best I couldn't stop laughing when she had her meeting. Ashby and Gabriel are so cute together I'm glad Ashby found his inner strength. And moving day what a blast they all had and I would have been right next to Rebecca and Kate.

That is were you get the best insight to your own situations in life."

Now I wish that we had had this book when we embarked on the path of clean living! This excellent book describes natural methods to remedy many issues that we would traditionally resolve with medication. It directly addresses the stigma that herbs may not be safe for you and promotes herbal remedies for ailments to cosmetics and more. This book walks you through your body and identifies how you can use common (and uncommon) herbs to do everything from resolving headaches to alleviating stress and cultivating relaxation. This is an invaluable resource for novices.
"11 1, 2013",B00GCR6I60,5.0,Holy Halloween!,AQ3XF1HYP2GWF,"I think this episode is my favorite! Firstly, I love Harrison for reading my mind. I totally laughed out loud because Vaughan said something and Harrison and I were thinking the exact same thing. So does that mean my mind is like that of a young teenage boy? Ew. I hope not. But still, I like Harrison all the more now.So, the whole group was voting on whether they would stay at Gage's settlement for a while or move on. Vaughan was trying to get Tyler's opinion on what she wanted to do. He told her that she and Miller were a part of their family now and families stick together. But he phrased it in such a way that me, Harrison, and any other person with a dirty mind would make it sound like it was perverted.Kane is in this book again. Like, a lot. And Reagan expresses all these &#34;feelings&#34; she has for him, and when I say &#34;feelings&#34; I do not mean lovey-dovey type feelings. I mean feelings of responsibility and other confused feelings that Reagan can't really explain. Now, I totally do not understand why Reagan think Kane is her responsibility. Kane is not her responsibility at all! He made his own decision to come after her. She does not have any obligation to him because of the choices he made. He was the one to leave The Colony. Reagan should not feel like it is her problem to fix.But whatever. Those feelings of mine were pointless once I read further into the story and Kane and Reagan were attacked by like seventy zombies or something ridiculously scary like that. One gun. A knife. And a piece of wood. Those were Reagan's and Kane's only weapons against the hungry horde that ran after them like Olympic sprinters.I believe that a near death experience (and one that is as terrifying as being chased by zombies) is a real bonding experience between people. I sure got bonded to Kane in this episode because of it. Their situation was so tragic and scary that I would have flung myself into Kane's arms after an experience like that. For sure! Reagan was being all reasonable and thinky...but I was just like, &#34;I would totally be hugging him and holding onto him in relief that I was still alive if I were you right now, Reagan.&#34; I mean, she got there, eventually. Just after thinking about it for a bit and then graciously allowing him to hug her. He wouldn't have needed my permission for a hug. I would have attacked him with a hug even if he didn't want it.But anyway, I got really emotional reading this episode and I loved it. And I really am intrigued by Kane now. Like really really interested. I want to have the next episode now so I can know what is going to happen with him next!"

"03 23, 2014",B00GDSLXAY,3.0,Three short stories and a novella,A1L2G59J9UGD07,"From the very beginning, this is a book with a difference, as it comprises three short stories and a novella. The short stories I found especially enjoyable and &#8216;The desert song&#8217; was my favourite. I enjoy mystical/science-fiction/ paranormal only if it is countered by a strong storyline with a realistic base. In this case a young girl embarks on a road trip into the desert and is chased by a skeleton. We never do find out why and I&#8217;m guessing that is deliberate on the author&#8217;s part to add to the mystery. I like to think she&#8217;s being chased by her own demons.The other stories and the novella I found to be more mystical and as you read more the magic/supernatural elements become stronger. As a result they appealed to me less as talking wolves and shape-changers really aren&#8217;t my taste. However, I did appreciate the quality of the writing. Carol Holland March has a beautiful lyrical style that is poetic in its quality.Somehow, even though each story and the novella show great promise, I personally felt that there was something missing in each of them. For me the stories worked better than the novella and if I were the author, I would be tempted to expand them a little into a collection of short stories.Sorry to say that this collection as it stands is not for me but fans of the genre I&#8217;m sure will love it."

You are absorbed in one story after another. Yet, she always gives you so much to ponder, while reading her stories. For some reason we think the Amish have a simple life, and meeting someone falling in love is a simple thing.  This shows us a different side , or rather you are taking a peek into their lives. Showing how  anxious they are, making plans for a wedding with over 200 people coming. This on top of making your dress, and preparing food for all that come. The last moment  thought that this is for life. Then she continues showing us the despair of being older and no boyfriend. Yet, only in early 20's , and they feel despair ,of will they find someone.. That life for the Amish is finding someone to share your life with. Then sharing life with family and friends.Then another story gives you in site  that it's not that easy to come back to the simple life, when you've been in the city. What does one do to get that calm feeling again. After having been around  televisions  and movie shows. Who can you talk to about this thought ?Another  story shows adoption, can one except that ? For we think of the large families the Amish have.Another showed a blind date ,being set up by her Mother, is this possible in the Amish way ?Another shows moving, without family and friends, in hopes for finding love.She has once again written amazing array of stories, that all ages will enjoy.

What a happy mistake. This book was a fantastic Contemporary Paranormal Suspense Romance----Great combination woven beautifully by the author. Ms Rosemoor was able to include all those elements and still maintain a balance. The world she created was engaging, the characters strong and multi dimensional. The dialogue was some of the wittiest I've encountered and the secondary characters were quirky and unique. This one had it all - shape shifters, ghosts, fallen angels, a species called the &#34;Protectors of Evil&#34; and a surprisingly well plotted romance among the suspense.I would read more from the author.*I received my copy from NetGalley.com in exchange fro an honest review."

"11 22, 2013",B00GG5ILU4,5.0,Could not get enough of this book!,A1GECJN7XHDKU6,"Complimentary copy provided by author for an honest review.I was lucky enough to receive an ARC of Disclosure of the Heart for my honest review. I have been waiting since I finished my ARC of Beside Your Heart. I absolutely love Adam and Nicki's story. Beside Your Heart was a sweet story, but missing something, and Disclosure of the Heart definitely had it and more.We pick back up right where we left off in Beside Your Heart. Nicki is nervous as all hell to see Adam again, and man, I wish I had some insight into what Adam was thinking..The way these two navigate around each other in this book, and try to come to terms with the past, heartbreak, and where to go now, is beautifully told. The past ruined these two (Beside Your Heart), and seeing them 16 years later still hurting is crazy. This story makes you believe in true love, and that when you find it, and lose it, it never really leaves.Both of these characters are not the same as when we met them in book 1, but I think they are better in book 2. I love, love, love Adam and he's definitely on my list of favorite book boyfriends. Nicki, sometimes I wanted to strangle her during this book, but I understand why she does what she does, and why she feels what she feels.Lisa and David are also a great side story in this book, and I want more of them too!! I can't wait till the last book in the series comes out (Forever Your Heart), but I don't want this story to end. These characters are amazingly written, and Mary makes you feel an emotional tie to them when you're reading. This series is one that everyone should add to their TBR list and pick up today. Beautifully written, great story, and characters that will stay with you long after you finish the book."

"06 9, 2014",B00GIALS0W,4.0,Portrait of the artist as a  blues musician,A2JXGBB09QK2YR,"The Psalmist is the third novel by Jason Akley that I&#8217;ve read, and it is my favorite of the three. Akley is an ambitious, immersive writer, and having read more of his work, I am admiring his vision more and more. As I felt with his novel Lazarus, Akley&#8217;s spiritual writing-godfather seems to be Faulkner, and that is a very good influence indeed!Spanning decades, from varying perspectives and in differing modes including straight narrative and journal entries, The Psalmist is structured as smaller books working together to form the larger picture. Unfolding the life of David Threnody, a blues musician, Akley shows Threnody&#8217;s life and its different veins and pulses. He explores the relationships Threnody has, and at times the novel feels like an extended blues jam where Threnody is swept down paths that then wend back.  It is an inside and outside exploration of the musician as artist, including his substance abuse, difficulties staying on the straight and narrow, and the constant calling of his music. Akley captures Threnody&#8217;s inner and outer worlds in vivid detail, and anyone interested in the lives of artists will find this novel worth reading. It&#8217;s a double edged sword living through music, and Akley&#8217;s novel weaves together a real life, not of a superstar, but of a regular human caught in the song."

We must do our part to see that every bear species survives.At certain times of the year, we have bears come down from the Sandia Mountains just above where we live.  During the dry years when there is little food for them in the mountains, they are forced to try to find food among the human population.  One night a month or so ago, we had one on our front deck.  He had knocked over the humming bird feeder and was having a nice drink of sugar water.Terrific book with great pictures!

I liked the characters - I enjoy a good bitchy heroine, and she had her reasons. The hero Gage was hot! I love IR romance and I enjoyed that aspect of the story as well. Gotta love a hot brother in cowboy boots :) Can't wait for the sequel! My only small qualm was some of the writing during the sex was a little...stiff. Eve's butt and boobs were both described as 'globes' at one point, which kind of made me laugh more than anything. But that's a small issue. Writing sex scenes is hard, hopefully the author gets a little better with them as she goes along. I'll definitely keep reading to find out!"
"11 20, 2013",B00GP0SB8W,4.0,"&#10024;Highly stimulating, descriptive and tantalizing tale!&#10024;",A1O5BMIWBH4OG2,"[...][...]My rating: 4 of 5 &#11088;&#65039;Starting in college, Coop discovered he had a gift.....to become whatever women needed to get satisfaction. In fact, he made good money slipping into the different personas. It doesn't matter to him, he loves women of all shapes and ages, and they love him. He also loves sex and is not interested in any kind of permanent attachments, only in the immediate satisfaction he can give his clients and his own gratification. Oh, and of course the money, which is the whole reason he started doing this in the first place.Other than his clients and his best friends, no one, and certainly not his family, knows what he actually does for a living. So far he has been able to work his cover story, but he knows that will not last forever. He is lucky that most of his clients are as allergic to publicity as he is. His family is the reason he needs the money, they are why he does this........well, and to be honest, he isn't complaining, he loves his job.A teenage crush, his sister's childhood friend Mia, suddenly reappears in his life in a big way. A crush he thought he was long over, but his body apparently never got the memo.She has as much of an impact now as she did then, perhaps even more. And although every fibre in his body is screaming to touch her, he knows he can't, not with his profession hanging around his neck like an albatross. She will never accept that.When Mia makes it clear he is not the only one holding back, they both act on the obvious sexual tension between them. But Coop knows, he will never be able to keep his two lives separated for long.....*********I need a bucket of ICE!!! This book was EROTIC......in capital letters.....and in a huge variety of ways to appease many interests.If I were to judge only based on the heat factor, I would likely have rated the book five stars, since Missy Johnson sure knows how to describe a lusty sex scene in a way that tingles right down to your toes!!! YOWZA!!!The storyline was also quite an interesting one and held a strong enough structure to fit all this yummy sex onto, without losing the frame of the story. Even the supporting cast was interesting in a subliminal way, not particularly fleshed out, but varied enough to set up the main characters nicely.And that is where I run into a bit of a snag........both Coop and Mia, the leads in this story, remain rather two-dimensional. Yes, there is some attempt made at deepening their personas, but I still find too much lacking.In Coop's case, despite his noble intentions, he remains a somewhat superficial and self-involved character who doesn't seem able to consider much more than his own satisfaction, whether it be HIS goal (noble as the cause may be) or HIS sexual or emotional gratification. And in the end he can't even make the appropriate choices for himself, but needs rescue.For Mia there just isn't enough context in the book. Now the entire story is written from Coop's perspective, which, though interesting, doesn't allow us much insight into Mia's history, or emotional state. We find out very little about where she comes from, what her life has been like thus far, or even what causes her to change her mind when she decides to give Coop a chance.All in all, a well-written book, with very high marks on the erotic scale, a solid and compelling storyline and characters I had a bit of trouble connecting with but that offered interesting possibilities!&#10024;Highly stimulating, descriptive and tantalizing tale!&#10024;**ARC provided in return for an honest review.**"
"12 9, 2013",B00GQ6CZRS,4.0,This was awesome and fun (and did I say awesome?),A38HEC658U7MUC,"What an intensely fun, steamy book! I knew going into this book that I would enjoy it but what I wasn&#8217;t quite expecting was how much. Lisa created a main character I could connect with on a book nerd level, envy over on a &#8220;she is totally in like/lust/love with a coffee-making-word-writing-hunk&#8221; level, and appreciate on a &#8220;she is a real-imperfectly-perfect-flawed person&#8221; level. On top of this obviously awesome main character, the story line is relevant, something I could totally picture, and full of little twists and turns that life so often brings on.Candy&#8230;err, I mean Candice was truly a gem of a main character. I am not lying when I say I sort of have a woman-fictional-character crush on her. She is just so real and genuine. I loved that she had moments of doubt and insecurity because seriously, who doesn&#8217;t? But then she would get totally kick-ass and be confident and fearless in moments that would have previously rendered her petrified. I ADORED that her personality was constant but she, as a person, was growing and molding into a fiercer (more fierce?) version of herself throughout the story.At the beginning of this book, Candice is struggling to find a balance from her real life in which she is a creative writing grad student and her secret life in which she is Candy, an up and coming writer of smexy, saucy books. Let me take a quick moment here to say just how much I love, love, LOVE the idea behind this book. Not everyone is a closeted erotic writer, but I do feel that most people have a part of themselves they keep hidden, afraid of what everyone else will think. This general idea told in a not-so-general way was awesomely genius and I applaud Lisa for that! Now back to your previously scheduled review&#8230;.: As the story goes on, the lines between her two separate lives start to blur and this is where the new and improved version of Candice starts to appear. I loved when this happened because it allowed her to open herself up to James the sexy barista (more on him later), stand up for herself to her jerk of a boss (even if he is sort of good-looking and also sort of a former crush), and finally, it allowed her to really think about the writer and person she wanted to be.There through Candice&#8217;s transformation was James. This sweet, funny, understanding, hot mass of a man is the one person who pushes Candice to be the best version of herself while also threatening her future by being well, one of her students. I will admit, this particular storyline is still a bit tough for me to grasp. HOWEVER, I thought Lisa wrote it in a way that made me think about and question my beliefs on the subject. While I&#8217;m still a tad unsure how I feel about the issue as a whole, I was not deterred from loving the freaking heck out of James and Candice&#8217;s relationship. He understands what scares her while also pushing her to face her fears. He knows their situation is fragile at best but still tries to make light of it by getting her candy apples (Get it? Because she is his sort-of teacher? I giggled endlessly through that scene&#8230;). Even though there are jokes, a HUGE unavoidable issue between them, and a big physical attraction, it&#8217;s the simple chemistry and understanding between them that made their relationship really work.Sneaking Candy had ALL of the things I love and appreciate about New Adult. It was more than the romance (even if that part did play quite an awesome role); it was about finding out who you are and who you want to be; it was about learning to stand up for yourself and following your dreams, whatever they may be. I loved watching Candice grow from a girl a little confused and a whole lot conflicted on who exactly she wants to be to a woman with confidence, drive, a dash of sassy, and of course a hot, new boyfriend that I may or may not still be drooling over.If you couldn&#8217;t pick it up during my review, than I am going to take this time right now to urge you to buy this book. You will laugh, maybe cringe, possibly sigh, and definitely swoon!"

The same professor she almost shared a kiss with........But that isn't the only forbidden....Along comes James, the gorgeous motorcycle riding hot sexy James, who serves her coffee, she lips him a sexy message and then finds out she is teaching him! Mortifying!There was some great moments from James, he actually made me tear up! At one point! He was really thoughtful and caring, I wish there was more of that chemistry and emotion between them as I really enjoyed that, and I wanted more of it......I am greedy like that!I wasn't expecting the bit of drama towards the end.....ooh! But very exiting, It was wrapped up quickly, I would have liked to have seen that develop a bit more.... been there for the playing out of the drama....again, I wanted more of it...The writing is beautiful, the characters are well written, you get involved straight away, they make you laugh, care....i will be reading more from Lisa, this was my first from her."

I am not saying that it is not a good read&#8230;it is, especially if you liked the other two (I LOVED the other two) but with this one&#8230;I wanted more. I wanted it to end MY WAY. I wanted closure&#8230;in a happy way. I craved for them to be together so the ending is ironic.

You get to learn about the marriage which I LOVED!! You get to learn about how Elijah felt about having Willow. I just wish it kept going in that direction.This book is about someone who has a HORRIBLE life with brief, beautiful, moments in between.&#34;After your heart breaks once, it never heals quite right. There are always cracks, or chipped pieces. And depending on what kind of person you are and what kind personal strength you have, sometimes after your heart breaks it can feel like you&#8217;ve never had a heart at all.&#34;I love Addy and I am so sorry for the life that she had.

"01 21, 2014",B00GS8SB2M,5.0,Like a fairytale from days of old!,A270WQDVN0X6J7,"This has a fabulous feeling of fantasy. As I started reading I felt like I was reading a fairytale, something that I would want to share with my daughter and nieces. As the story progresses I started wondering when the crap was going to hit the fan! So much is in this that I wasn&#8217;t sure what to be scared of exactly, but I knew from the ominous feeling that something was going to happen, and it does! Ohhh it does!Sam, the main character, has inherited her father&#8217;s clock shop. But unlike her father she is full of ambition. She can see where she wants to take the company, just not how. Then she meets Piv. She goes from not believing in fairies to believing but it definitely wasn&#8217;t an immediate thing. She even tries to shoot the poor little guy! But as we learn more about him and his little friends we find out that he&#8217;s an elf and that&#8217;s where the story really starts!The plot was fabulous. I really enjoyed the growth, or even lack of growth, of the characters and where they went. I really was getting into the book and it&#8217;s at right around halfway when that ominous feeling starts to show it&#8217;s ugly face but then it wasn&#8217;t it feeling! Stuff starts happening and Sam can&#8217;t keep control of everything around her. It&#8217;s just crazy!Much like the older fairy tales where they didn&#8217;t necessarily have a good ending, and where you&#8217;re not sure if the heroine is going to come out on top, this book is exactly like that. I was waiting with bated breath to see what was going to happen and didn&#8217;t get many answers until nearly the end.And it was the way that Ramsey doesn&#8217;t spoon feed the information but made Sam work for it that I liked as well. We&#8217;ve all heard stories about elves but you never know which ones are true so Sam had to find her own way through the mess.Absolutely brilliant writing. Just a few wordy spots that I wanted to skim through to get to the meat of the story but nothing that would detract from a great book.4.5 / 5"

"11 24, 2013",B00GT0NLZQ,2.0,Not So Cool......,A2Y3ZGVRA3S23L,"I waited so long for this book, but I got a feeling I will be disappointed from what I read in the 2nd book. The way the1st book ended was very frustrating, then we got a preview of bk 2, I thought there will be relief. Book 2 was just a rambling print that ended worse than bk 1. This 3rd book at the beginning did not show any promises. After Trip called Layla, that he lost his dad, he started acting as if the event at  the end of bk 2 was of no effect. As a matter of fact they had sex that same day without talking about what went down before.Then they were together of course, but then burst came, and it was quickly resolved. That was a riddle to me. How long was Layla in Norman before they resolved their differences? Your guess is as good as mine. Then towards the end we got how everybody else was doing, except for the H and h. Oh they are together, traveling  together yada yada. Then we got two sentences of what will happen in their lives, and the end. What if? After all with the H's line of work, and his history as a man whore anything can happen.Yeah, that's it. Also the use of humor sometimes in this book is inappropriate, and very annoying. Some serious situations are reduced to one-liners.Now why is this plot not condensed to one book, and maximally two books? It bothers me when authors pull this trick. It is becoming stupidly expensive for me to indulge in my favorite hobby. What a shame."

Tom&#8217;s bright narration is back in full-force, and it&#8217;s hard not to be charmed by him and the colorful denizens that dot Merrow&#8217;s cozy English countryside world.Book 2 finds plumber Tom (who has an innate ability to find hidden things, including buried bodies) getting used to his new relationship to former high school bully/now all-grown-up boyfriend Phil and getting even more used to his family reentering his life as his sister Cherry tells him that a) he has a surprise bequest from a neighbor who had passed away and b) she&#8217;s getting married and wants Tom to meet her new beau, the literally big-handed clergy member Greg.The engagement party is interrupted by an attempted murder and Tom and Phil (who&#8217;s a private detective, as well as protective boyfriend) are on the case to find out who&#8217;s tried to poison Cherry.The case gives Merrow a good excuse to introduce a village full of red herrings for Tom to parse through, some funny, some melancholic, and along the way, he discovers some things he hadn&#8217;t been searching for, as well as finding out the greater depths of his and Phil&#8217;s developing relationship.Tom is one of my favorite Merrow heroes, second only to Al in Muscling Through. She&#8217;s created a real winner here with his cheeky, flirty charm and his upbeat presence as he works his plumbing jobs, seeks out answers for the case, and quietly juggles his self-conscious feelings for Phil and his fear that he won&#8217;t match up to Phil&#8217;s deceased husband.The side characters are also great, whether it&#8217;s flamboyant BFF Gary and his former porn star beau, closed-up Cherry who slowly thaws as she and Tom grow closer again, or Tom&#8217;s police contact Dave. Phil is a stalwart presence in Tom&#8217;s life. Neither he nor Tom are great at communicating or navigating the ups & downs, but slowly, they inch forward as they see what the other wants, and you can tell that even when they&#8217;re clumsy, they care about each other. (And I love the times when Tom decides to not say what he&#8217;s feeling, but then blurts it out automatically, like a reflex.)The mystery is fun and twisty, and I didn&#8217;t guess what was going to happen, which is always a plus. I also loved how much Merrow painted in the villages and towns where everyone lived. You get a real feel for the English countryside setting.I think the only thing I wasn't a fan of was some of Tom's mental tangents, but overall, I liked his narration so much, that I was able to glide through most of those.It's also pretty low heat, with just a few intimate scenes, and others that are fade to black. I was fine with this because I loved the story, but for those looking for a five-pepper heat mystery, this isn't the one.If I could have a wish, it would be to see this on TV. It would be a GREAT mystery series. But until the BBC picks it up, I am 150% satisfied with the funny and charming world that Merrow has built in these books, and ECSTATIC that at the end of book 2, she announces that the adventures will continue for our plumber in book 3, Heat Trap."
"02 13, 2014",B00GVGAW8C,5.0,One of my favorite series!,AG0UDXBFAMAKI,"I absolutely books in this genre and Jill does an awesome job again with Glistening Rebellion.  I highly recommend reading Glistening Haven first - you will not be able to put either book down so they are &#34;quick&#34; reads because there is never a dull moment.  If you don't, there is some background information provided so you are not lost.  I put aside another series I was reading to read these books and read them straight through.  Usually I bounce back and forth between books.  Not this time!  I do not want to give away what a Glistening is but just know that they are a suppressed group that decides to fight against the powers that are suppressing them.  Sound familiar?  All characters are even more developed in book 2 and in the end - I WANT MORE....I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."
"04 26, 2014",B00GVKM9NE,4.0,Looking for more from Mickey Corrigan,A2ETTCN0R9DPY1,"Tami Lee Conkers is a spunky Florida chick who works at a homeless shelter. Cat Avery is handsome, well-educated, articulate, funny and dark. He lives in a bum motel and bartends right down the street from Tami Lee. She falls for him&#8212;even though she knows better. The man is a registered sex offender.Avery claims he's innocent. Tami Lee is following her heart, but she's afraid she knows where that will take her. The love they make feels doomed. All around them, life is going from bad to worse. Especially since the Gulf Stream has stopped moving for the first time in thousands of years.My Review:This is a short read with a cast of fun characters.  The plot of this story is different, not your usual bad girl meets bad boy they fall into bed and things get complicated.  This story was complicated before the two even met and it only got more so as the story progressed.  Being that this is a short story it was difficult to get a lot of background and truly connect with Cat and Tami Lee, but it was easy to care about them.  The ending was a surprise, as far as how it got there.I enjoyed this novella and will certainly look for more from Mickey J. Corrigan."
"03 4, 2014",B00GWC0Z2I,2.0,She's Not You,A1JMSX54DO3LOP,"Surprisingly disappointing and boring romance story.  Mimi Barbour has been a favorite of mine.  I did not like the following paragraph:One man dressed in camouflage, probably ex-military, became particularly belligerent.  It took two cops to subdue him and Belle felt her heart go out to the loser, one who'd likely served his country.Please do not believe anyone who has served this country honorably is a loser.People suffering from and through trauma, PTSD, etc. are not losers.  Yes, they are lost but not losers.I will not re-read this book. Doubt I will purchase any more works of hers."

"03 2, 2014",B00GZOEAQU,5.0,A horrifying story unlike any other.,A3KHEHA21V1CKF,"A paranormal story unlike any other. If you are looking for an original plot look no further. Awakening is a story filled with the need for revenge and a character who takes an ugly path in order to survive and avenge the deaths of loved ones. Filled with so many unexpected twists and unbearable pain. It is beautifully, yet horrifyingly descriptive. I couldn't put it down! Every single time I thought I was getting to a lull where I might be able to stop reading the hooks dug in deeper.Colina goes through some horrific trauma and the author portrays her going through PTSD in a such a raw way. It is a very realistic portrayal of someone going through so much pain at once. Colina undergoes quite the change as tragedy molds her into someone much stronger. I feel like witchcraft is portrayed exactly as it should be in this book, it doesn't come easy.One thing I can say for sure is that this book is nothing like what I expected. I will be looking forward to more from this author."

What follows is the development of a sweet, heartwarming relationship and some amazingly, hot sex scenes.Sosie is worried about keeping a secret from Derek--the secret that she is one of Santa's Elves; but Derek thinks she is keeping a much more devious and dangerous secret.  A secret that could cost both of them their lives or fellow officers of the NYPD.If you are looking for an entertaining, light-hearted Christmas story, purchase Paige Tyler's, Santa's Wayward Elf"

So if you don't want to find love, don't drink the water.  Devon and Tara have been shot by cupid's arrow.  Now, you can read their story.  There are few ups and downs along the way as well as stubborn main characters not wanting to find love.  Dual point of views.  No cliffhanger.  However, this is the first book in a series."
"12 10, 2013",B00H0MFT2A,5.0,Great Character Development and High Adventures,A2JR0TUSBM9WPQ,"I started reading this series not long after it was released.  Beginning of a Hero reeled me in to Windemere.  Prodigy sucked me even further in to the characters and events.  Allure of the Gypsies was more engaging.  There was great character development and as we follow Luke back to his home town, we learn more about his history and why he does things and thinks the way he does.  Add in Nyx and now Sari, stir in the Lich and Trinity and Kalam and Isaiah and you have the makings of a great book.  There are plenty of adventures thrown in to spice it up.If you are looking for a grand fantasy book (series), I highly recommend Legends of Windemere.  They are easy books to follow and I know I can't wait for the next book in the series."

"02 3, 2014",B00H0UT5UO,5.0,A Fantastic Read!,A1V8JNUT1SOJEQ,"Tegan Ashton had been attacked four years earlier by a man who she recently witnessed burying a woman on the beach. There are things about her attack that she hadn't told anyone because they would have thought her crazy.Gabe is a demon hunter and private eye, hired by Tegan to find the man who attacked her. He is emotionally scarred after losing someone close to him in a most horrible way. He knows there's more to this guy stalking Tegan, but how does he explain exactly what's going on without freaking her out?I liked that although Tegan had been attacked and had been through hell afterwards, she could still kick some demon ass. She owns a dojo and teaches karate, so she knows how to defend herself.The twists and turns this story took really made it a page turner. Gabe and Tegan are given small bits and pieces of a much larger puzzle and have to try and figure out why a demon wants Tegan so badly. When they finally piece everything together, I was shocked and excited to see where this story was going to end up. It's like seeing the final pieces in a good mystery and knowing how all the facts go together and why things happened the way they did.These two have pasts that prevent them from wanting to meet someone new to love, pasts that have wounded them emotionally, but once they are alone together there's not much that can keep the sparks from flying. The emotional scars start to heal as they get rid of the demons who have haunted their past, but they still have a long way to go. These two are made for each other but they never would have met if Tegan hadn't been attacked and she never would have found out about the secrets in her family if she hadn't met Gabe. This book shows us that even if we don't know why things happen the way they do, they happen for a reason. Sometimes we find out why and sometimes we don't. Tegan and Gabe do and it makes the whole story come together so wonderfully.The sex is hot and even though Gabe is a big bad demon hunter, he knows how to seduce a woman. There were some kick ass fight scenes. Nothing like battling demons and witches to get the heart racing.If you like Demons, dragons, witches, black magic and two people who find each other right when they need to, then this is the book for you.[...]"

My son-in-law is a chiropractor and he has always taught that the way to lose weight is to change your lifestyle. As I read this book I noticed that several of the suggestions were ones that my son-in-law suggests to his patients wanting to lose weight. The 22 suggestions in this book are some of the things that you can do to gradually lose weight.  Gradual weight loss is the secret to losing the weight and keeping it off.

Together, we can defeat the enemy.'",A328S9RN3U5M68,"Reading this initial novel for young adults by Australian author Calvin Gomes gives notice that there may be a successful new young adult fantasy series  on the horizon. Gomes holds degrees in Engineering and Environmental Management and has served as a primary force on projects in the mining industry. So what brings this young man to the arena of writing? First, he has always loved writing and reading outside of the technical realm, and second, he is the father of five living in Perth, Western Australia - among them, a daughter with a deep interest in young adult fantasy. This book is his first in what Gomes states will be a trilogy, and if this first installment is indicative of success, there likely will be more trilogies in the future! In Gomes' words, `I have read a number of young adult fantasy novels and found many characters did not behave sensibly, whilst some events were just too convenient. I have worked hard to make my characters believable and have avoided being too convenient. But remember, it is a fantasy tale, so magic does happen. A note on my evil characters--everyone likes them. I enjoyed creating them and making them credible. Many of their driving thoughts and emotions are what we may experience in life, either in us or in our colleagues.'Griffin and Cassius are student Caladons, priest-like warriors, tasked with a mission beyond their capability - to seek the legendary Orbis, prophesied in their ancient text to have the power to save their world. The two students in tandem with their tutor and other survivors discover many things about themselves and evil. They come to understand why their creator chose them for the mission. The tale is rich in bizarre and evil creatures, dangers at nearly every turn, and the omnipresent Evil.The quality of Gomes' writing is as crystalline clear as the finest engineering renderings. Spoiler alert: Example: `Griffin frowned. How could they defeat the Krolls without further violence and bloodshed? ""Griffin,"" Esor said. ""I wish as much as you to stop this conflict before others are hurt. But you must remember the prophecy. Sodin said the war would continue for decades, until his return to defeat Molloch."" Esor placed a hand on his shoulder, ""You are the Orbis, the one who has come to help us withstand Molloch's forces until Sodin's return. You must continue training and help with the battle ahead of us."" Griffin heart sank, ""But I feel inadequate for such responsibility."" ""I feel inadequate at times with my responsibilities. What is one person against so many?"" Esor looked deeply into his eyes, ""Griffin,it is important you remember that you are not alone. You have all of us, your friends, all working with you. Together, we can defeat the enemy.""For lovers of young adult fantasy this book rates very high on the scale of competitors. Calvin Gomes likely has a major secondary career in the making.

"01 23, 2014",B00H6ETDTC,4.0,Loved,APVSL1L0UP8BK,"About 2 years ago, Paranormal Romance was my favorite genre and pretty much all I read. There are times though, that reading the same things over and over getting pretty well... redundant. So that's when I got on my YA kick. Temptation by Fire was an amazingly hot & sexy read that reminds me why I love this genre so much. Although this is on the shorter side, it definitely wasn't lacking; in plot or steaminess!I loved Ava and Karson. Ava is tortured by visions of death when she touches someone, skin to skin. She doesn't always have these visions, but when she does, it's pretty horrifying. She is quiet, reserved and only has her friend Miriam to confide in. She is pretty naive and soft, but she does a 180 and is almost a completely different person. Stubborn, tough and brave.Karson, a Venator, or Demon Hunter, rather; is driven by vengeance to avenge his family, whom was murdered 10 years prior. He's dedicated his life to Demon Hunting. He's a pretty scary guy, but in that bad ass sexy I-want-to-jump-his-bones kind of way. Since he feels responsible for what happened to his family, he doesn't get close to anyone. Obviously, until Ava.Whew, this two had some serious chemistry. I rather enjoyed their banter, steamy scenes and how they came to care for each other, overall. Since they both had their reservations about a relationship, it was difficult for both to come to terms with their feelings and how to handle it. With it being so short, I was surprised how much I connected to them both and rooting for them from the get go.Goes to show how awesome the writing is.The plot was fast paced and very engaging. The idea behind Demons possessing humans and feeding off their energy was pretty fascinating, and pretty frightening. The were only two ways to &#34;banish&#34; the demon, and neither one were &#34;ideal&#34;. Beheading or an exorcism. Also, how tattoos were used to give the Hunters strength too. What I didn't realize I appreciated until later, was that there are repercussions for those tattoo's; since they are done using Demon blood as well. There were a few plot twist thrown in that completely blindsided me, too.My Peeve- This honestly doesn't affect my rating at all but the formatting made this difficult for me to read. Other than that? Nothing.Overall- I loved it! Temptation by Fire is my first Tiffany Allee and I can promise you it will not be my last. With non-stop action, realistic characters, hot & steamy scenes too, I highly recommend this one for any/all paranormal romance lovers."

I learned ways on how to understand them during the different stages that they go through. Every parent should read this book!"
"02 26, 2014",B00H956XH8,4.0,4.0 on the Masq Scale,A1UF3KMS03JO41,Belinda F.'s ReviewI haven't read the previous two books Larry Kollar's series so I came to this without any of the history of the two main characters but I really don't think it mattered. Although there clearly is a back story The Sorcerer's Daughter stands alone and is a really good read in its own right (having said that any of the previous story that is useful to know is seamlessly woven into the narrative).The main character is Sura although Mik is a close support and vital to her story. Their magical growth is mirrored by their journey into their own maturity - they learn about their talents but at the same time about their feelings for each other. This makes both characters feel real and relatable despite being skilled in magical arts. They have obviously grown during the series and Sura's discovery of her own ancestry and her decisions of how to deal with what she learns all add to her journey.The Sorcerer's Daughter is a short read but an enjoyable one. I can see that followers of the series might find the fact that this is little more than a short story a bit frustrating but the standard of the writing and the development of the characters will hopefully make up for that.
"03 23, 2014",B00HATNY9S,4.0,Just in Time,A1QDAWZ0ED4OBQ,"Kathyrn Shay did a wonderful job of bringing romance, humor and time travel together in the first of her trilogies Portals of Time.  Three women travel back from the future to change the course of history to save mankind.  I found it an enjoyable, well written story.  The characters were well balanced and realistic.  I like when each book in a trilogy can be read alone or as part of the series.  I can not stand when there is a cliff hanger at the end and you must purchase the sequels.  This is definitely one of those books that can be read alone or if you love it, like I did, and want to purchase the rest you can.  Time travel, romance and humor...what more can one ask from a book?"

The romance between Jennifer and David is very sweet and his daughter Lily couldn't be more adorable.I would recommend this book for a great light read that will leave you with a big smile on your face.  I will definitely be reading more from this author!"
"05 10, 2014",B00HBJD0EG,5.0,Spoiler Alert!  Forgotten Yesterday Review,A31JKMH5ZF9JDH,"I loved reading this book Forgotten Yesterday.  The idea of having a book go back in time and forward in time is just a great concept.  I connected with Ruby as a person, and her connection with Brent.  He is a strong character who I really fell for in terms of having a male character to care for. I read the first book first to be able to understand the story, and the feeling of the loss of a child is just horrible. I know personally about the struggle of losing a child, and the feeling of loss drags down relationships.  This book is a great read and everyone should take the time to read it!  Read this book!

It told the story of a girl who found a boy living in her garage. Regardless of how sketchy that may sound, the two of them ended up growing pretty close, and there weren&#8217;t many questions about why he was in the garage. That was the only thing that disturbed me about this novel. Hanley, our leading lady, was a little too okay with some random boy being in here garage for me. Hanley was a self proclaimed rebel. She didn&#8217;t like living under her parent&#8217;s thumb, and that was something that I ccan relate to a bit. Nate was the boy living in her garage. He was running from something that I&#8217;m not going to spoil, but he definitely had a back story. The two of them together made a cute couple, regardless of their less than normal beginnings. There was actually somewhat of a plot in this novel, which is rare for contemporaries. The drama with Nate and what he was running for definitely made the novel more interesting, and there were some unexpected discoveries that happened, which made the novel intriguing to read. The characters were also very well developed, which is always a plus. They had pasts and layers, and reasons that they acted the way that they did. Overall, Where You&#8217;ll Find Me was an exceptional novel about a boy running from his past and a girl willing to let him in."
"02 16, 2014",B00HC1CY86,5.0,Scorching HOT!!!,A3ASIMH21NNE7Q,"All I have to say is analyzing is overrated, like big time.Piper Morgan has just gotten the best news in her life and it was time to celebrate, so one girl&#8217;s night out she ends up making a bet with a sexy biker.  If she wins she ends up riding his motorcycle (loved reading that she was able to ride something else very well) but if he won then she must give him a striptease.Brett Sullivan can&#8217;t believe his luck to have such a beautiful woman strip teasing him in his home but the moment that he saw her lingerie he couldn&#8217;t wait any longer.  He needed to have her and he was going to have her.  Only he never thought that he would come out of the shower and realize that the little woman had left his bed.  How long will it take to get her back?Wow what can I say but this short story but that it was one HOT read and totally captivating.  The characters in this read are fun and would love to know more about them.  It&#8217;s well written and what can I say about the sex scenes, scorching HOT.  I love that they are tastefully done and in great detail.  The storyline was intriguing and hated to see it end so quickly.Abbie St. Claire did not disappoint with this short erotic read.  I can&#8217;t wait to see what she has in store next.  Pick this up today you will not be disappointed."
"02 12, 2014",B00HCJX4MI,5.0,great book,A312RM6VLC3U9M,This book is different from the normal western. The main subject is not the best looking person on earth. He does some dumb things and the story has some unusual twists. It was real refreshing to read
"03 1, 2014",B00HD0KD8O,5.0,Loved this series,A1FC757XAYMZWK,"This final book in the Chronicles of Katrina was so worth the wait!Ah, Simon...what can I say about this man? He is every woman's wet dream. We meet him in The Dare as one hot, bigger than life, alpha cop shrouded in mystery. As the story continues through Double Dare and The Truth, the mystery around Simon dissipates as he shows us he is really just a man trying to deal with unfamiliar emotions, misplaced guilt and self-imposed responsibilities. In The Consequence, with help from the woman he loves, Simon finally comes to terms with the man he is and the desire to be better.And Kat. The sweet, nave, inhibited genius, exploited and humiliated by her boyfriend, Evan in The Dare. But with Simon's patience and guidance, she blooms into a strong, confident, sexy woman willing and able to stand up for herself and her man.They are not without obstacles in their way every time they turn around. There is Amanda, Simon's widowed sister-in-law who thinks of Simon as her husband's replacement. She does her best to get Kat out of the way and uses her young daughter in the process. Then there is Evan, Kat's ex-boyfriend and co-worker, who feels intellectually inferior to her, files charges of sexual harassment and corporate espionage against her that ultimately get her arrested and fired from her job. He sold her research for his own financial gain and tries to sell a deadly bacterium that could have a global impact.The Consequence takes us through the events of the investigation and the sting that puts Kat in harm's way. It takes us through Simon and Kat's deep and passionate love affair, overcoming so many obstacles and a declaration of their love for each other like no other.I'm giving this book five stars because I love this story so much, but in reality, I would knock it back to maybe 4.5 stars because of two things: First, there are so many loose ends that are not tied up leaving many unanswered questions and second, it has numerous grammatical errors and several continuity issues. Normally, those things really bother me, but I can overlook them because of my love for Simon and Kat. I've read other print books by Ms. Tabke and didn't notice errors like the ones in this e-Book. I'm not sure where the problem lies, but I'm guessing self-published editors are not as picky as publishing house editors.A couple continuity examples:In The Dare, when Simon gets the ""Mandy"" phone call in his hotel room, ""Katrina gathered her soiled clothes to go."" And when he leaves to meet with Amanda in the restaurant, Kat looks at his laptop and sees a picture of them with a little girl. ""She slammed the lid shut, grabbed her pukey clothes, shoes and purse and ran from his room to the safety of hers."" After she gets home and finally unpacks her suitcase a day later, one of her Louboutins is missing. ""Had she left one behind? No, she distinctly remembered wrapping them up in her damp clothes..."" Then in Double Dare, Simon shows up at her place with the shoe. How did he get it if she packed it up after he left the room?Also, in The Dare, after Evan admitted he was married and when Kat thought about their relationship, ""They only met on weekdays, he always had to be somewhere on the weekend. He never spent the night at her place and they never went to his place."" And in Double Dare, ""Movies had been the only thing she and Evan did outside of sex in her apartment."" In one book, he never spent the night at Kat's place and was never there on weekends. But in the Consequence, ""Ugh, he still had the key to the downstairs door."" Why would he have a key and how did Rosie and Elliot know who he was when they saw him leaving a restaurant with his wife and when he tried to break in to Kat's apartment if he was never there?In The Consequence, when Kat runs home (again) after Simon took too long coming back from his mother's house, she showers and ""threw on a pair of yoga pants and a tee shirt"" and goes over to Rosie and Elliot's place. When she gets back and Simon shows up, he pulls her onto his lap and ""His hand slid down her waist to her hips then beneath the little cammie top she was wearing."" When did she change her clothes?Things that left me hanging:The lunch date with Simon, Kat and Livy. Suddenly, that scenario was pulled from the reader by a quick note from Simon to Kat that Livy was sick and lunch was off as if the author changed her mind about going with that idea. I was hoping to meet Livy and Simon's mother at some point, as well.Simon took care of the situation with Amanda. How? What happened? There was no further information other than Simon's threat that his friends were more powerful than hers. Someone as caustic as Amanda wouldn't just nicely go away especially when there will always be interaction between Simon and Livy. If I was Kat, I'd want details!Mark was causing problems for their mother. What kind of problems? What did he do? No further details there, either.What happened with Veronica and Mat? We never heard from Veronica again. Even when Kat went back to her office, she had ""an emergency"" and was out.How did Evan find out he was being investigated? The explanation was ""a little birdie told me"". That detail was glossed over with no further explanation. Since the task force had been investigating Evan for two years and that was the basis for the whole story, I would think that would be an important piece of information.I'm sure these points are not important to most readers and I agree that the love story is the main focus. But I like to see these all the little details resolved or explained so I don't have to wonder what happened and be left with that incomplete feeling. I know there were some issues that delayed the original release date of The Consequence. I'm not sure if that's the reason, but, as much as I loved this book, I felt as if this final part was somewhat rushed and could have used a little more tightening to tie it all up.Having said that, I am really having a hard time letting go of Simon and Kat. I've read the entire series several times and I'm looking forward to another glimpse of their life together in the upcoming Bad Boys of the Bay series. I totally adored Rosie and Elliot and hope to see them in the future as well.I wholeheartedly recommend this book as well as the entire Chronicles of Katrina series. The books are cliffhangers so they definitely need to be read in order. This will always be a re-read for me."

"01 10, 2014",B00HE0FPFE,5.0,Simply Beautiful!,A2LRV6NXPU3OZA,"I am a big fan of Leland Dirks. His book, Jimmy Mender and His Miracle Dog, is one of the best I've EVER read. Leland has a special gift of making his characters REAL. They aren't superstars, nor do they have any unique  powers. They are simple, everyday people who hurt, love, need friendship, are compassionate, and remind us of important life lessons.Dirks also uses dogs in his stories to help get his messages across. In my opinion, there are only two types of beings in the world who are totally innocent and as close to angels as we can get &#8211; children and animals. I love how Leland gives the dogs in his stories angel-like qualities and how they make people BETTER people, just as they do in real life.The Christmas short is one that you should keep in your library to read every year and share with others. It tells of the true meaning of Christmas and that we should keep that true meaning close to our hearts ALL year long."
"12 20, 2013",B00HEM6M3G,5.0,"Fun, quick read!",A107ZOMJ8VFSKV,"I love finding new authors through authors I already enjoy, and this is no exception.  Garth Perry and J.A. Konrath have put together an awesome short story here, bringing cynical LT. Jack Daniels in on a case with psychic investigator, AJ Rakowski.  The story is fast paced and funny, even though it deals with some pretty dark subject matter (kidnapping is just the beginning of the crazy in this one).  I would absolutely recommend this for anyone who enjoys mystery/thrillers."

"01 7, 2014",B00HFDTFVK,4.0,A Good Read!!,AP8XV64ZGH312,"~*~My Thoughts~*~A 4 star RatingAlright now i read other people reviews going into this where they complained of the love at first sight thing and being to rushed. Normally I probably would have agreed, if I hadn't read the reviews. So going in knowing things were rushed, it was fine for me. I just looked at it like a fairy tale and really enjoyed it. Every once in a while a book like this is nice to read. The villains were exactly that and most of the characters had good development. All in all i think the book is worth taking the time to read it is short so it shouldn't take to long. I also hope this review lets you know going it to get ready for quick love and treat it as a fairytale.Received an ARC from NetGalley for an honest review."

The cover didn't draw me in however, I have learned to not judge a book by its cover so I finally read it and it was an awesome read. I just cannot understand why the author chose this cover. It doesn't look anything like the book describes the characters and its not Hot at all:( I almost missed out on this wonderful read!"

The good thing was that the author was committed to releasing each new episode in a quick and timely manner without compromising the story, so I didn't have to wait long for the next book in the series.But now that Billionaires in Disguise: Rae (Complete Series, Episodes 1-9) is available you don't have to wait to read the whole arc without interruption.PS Blair is currently hard at work on a new seriesEnjoyA free copy of most of the individual ebooks in this series was given to me by the publisher for review, but has in no way influenced this review.

It is a clever idea to have the Chinese conspiring with other countries and with greedy American politicians to shift the reserve status away from the U.S. Worth your time to read since the economics part of it is light enough so your eyes won't glaze over while it is being explained."

Why do authors feel the need to do all this extra stuff with their story and plot lines. There were just too many different things happening. The rogue + ops 4-16 + emergence + matlal weres + the dragon spirit guide issues and her house + police officer now gunning for her + her hybrid status (really? a hybrid is a  mix of two things. why the added portion?) + Jen + Alex + her werewolf issues + her athanate issues + her sister + the change in alpha status when she's on four legs (seriously??????)....see where i'm going with this? It was unnecessarily complicated. I really really really liked this series. But there was just too much going on. I might be interested to read the next, but I won't promise that i will."

"12 24, 2013",B00HGX5ASQ,4.0,the closure Marc finally needed,A3E8BQOX3OOUH2,"When we started this journey we met 3 men who were all so different. Adam who was grieving so deeply for his wife and was ready to give up on life and his career in the military, Damian who met his soul mate but lost her all in the same night, and Marc who suffered from great guilt over the death of his brother Gino. Adam went to lead these men in battle that left them all with both physical and emotional scars to add to the ones they already brought into war.In each of their stories Kally goes into such depth in detail of the BDSM lifestyle that brings them all together after the military, PTSD, sexual abuse, physical abuse, and amputation just to name a few.  Before finally getting each story we thought we knew what demons haunted each of these men and women but find out we hadn&#8217;t even scratched the surface.That was definitely the case with Marc d&#8217;Alessio. This is Marc&#8217;s second story. The first introduced us to Marc and who was to become his woman, Angelina Giardano. But Marc still held secrets at the end of the first book both from Angelina and himself. The ones he was holding from himself he didn&#8217;t even subconsciously know about. This book is about the journey he goes on in the discovery about his childhood and the past that he has blocked out or forgotten. Angelina has always known Marc was holding things back and this prevented their relationship from moving out of the limbo state they are in. She is still vulnerable when it comes to him but when his journey to discover past secrets takes him down many paths she decides she is going to stand by her man even when at one point he walks away from her.This book gives us the closure Marc finally needed with Gino and makes it possible for Marc and Angelina to finally start journey of happily ever after."

"05 11, 2014",B00HKZBD18,3.0,"A well informed book which, unfortunately, needs proofreading and a minor edit.",A2TQTPT4S772SD,"I was asked to read this book in return for an honest review, and downloaded a free copy from Amazon during a promotion.The book is divided into two parts: The first part is a story told from the perspective of one of the bees. The second part is educational, and draws together information found on the web.There are some words in here that would require an adult to explain for most children who would read this book. The addition of photographs drawn from the web is a nice idea. However, I feel that the first half of the book would benefit greatly from children's illustrations, rather than the small photos which are more suited for the educational part of the book. All of the images appeared tiny on my kindle fire HD 8.5&#34; screen, and would be more effective if they were enlarged.The story aspect has been called an adventure, but nothing out of the ordinary happens to the two young adventurers. It would be more accurate to say that the first half of the book is a story about the life of a bee as told from a bee's perspective.  There are quite a few spelling mistakes, tense confusions and punctuation anomalies for a book this small. Which is a shame, especially as a children's book like this not only teaches about bees and the world around us, but also about our language ... how to read, which leads into how to write. I do not refer to any differences between US and UK spellings here. For example: Once is used instead of One, etc. Commas and question marks are absent; that kind of thing.I highly commend the idea behind the book, and congratulate the author for producing a series of books that are all about educating children about the world around us, and the importance of protecting it. This book discusses death, as it relates to bees, and I feel this was done in a sensitive and gentle manner. It also talks about mating and sperm. It is difficult for me to put an age range on this book. For one, this is outside my area of expertise. Secondly, the story seems to be aimed at quite young readers, yet contains words and topics that require explanation--especially in the educational half. I would have no problem with children in my care, of five years and above, reading this book. Although, be prepared for questions!Due to the above mentioned issues, I offer 3 out of 5 stars for this book."

It sites some of the brightest and most influential minds in history which gives it good credibility. One of the things I really liked about this book is the activities, games, and mental exercises to make positive thinking more of a habit than a forced behavior. I noticed that it covers a whole lot of things besides just &#34;acting positive.&#34; It also talks about wealth, positive psychology, and positive thinking secrets that will really help to improve your life. The chapter that talks about being around negative people really opened my eyes.  I plan on trying to teach my children some of the methods from this books so that they will grow up vibrant no matter what happens. Thank you for writing this book, I'm really excited about using some of these techniques!"

Someone very close and dear to me suffers from it and I have my own dealings with it myself. This book serves as a great guide in not only dealing with the effects of depression, it also shows very helpful  ways to heal yourself from within. While many books dealing with depression discuss the mental side-effects of depression and ways to remedy it, this book goes further in showing the reader how to face depression and the mental and the physical in a very thought-provoking manner. Depression affects many and this book works on many levels in facing it head-on and pulling yourself from the depths of it. I highly recommend it."
"07 10, 2014",B00HNU7Z26,5.0,"An Emotional, Heartrending Journey",A1EECIRBL7RI7N,"A Single Step is a slow burner, in the very best sense of the word, as we follow Emma Grayson&#8217;s reluctant return to life after the devastating loss of her beloved daughter and the ensuing break up of her marriage. The first step back to the land of the living comes for Emma when she takes a job as stable manager on a large mysterious country estate. It&#8217;s through the friendships she makes here that she is able to reconnect with the world.For me, A Single Step operates on two levels. Primarily it is the emotional journey of a woman, completely destroyed by the events life has thrown at her, to recovery. However, alongside this there&#8217;s an underlying tension that is simmering just beneath the surface, keeping the reader on edge until the climax of the novel, which sees Emma facing serious danger.I think Georgia Rose&#8217;s real skill as a writer lies in her painstaking attention to detail. She creates in Melton Estate a world that is totally believable. Rose&#8217;s passion for horses is apparent in the loving descriptions she offers as Emma tends to the horses in her care. Despite knowing absolutely nothing about horses, I found myself totally caught up in Emma&#8217;s devotion to them. The way that Rose describes the emotional turmoil that Emma endures, particularly the death of her daughter, is so involving and heartrending, I found myself moved to tears.I like Emma as a character, complete with massive chip on her shoulder and prickly defensiveness. Her true personality only comes out initially through her interactions with her dog and the horses. Emma&#8217;s love interest, Trent, is no less troubled than she is but the pair make a good match. Georgia Rose also gives us a likeable cast of supporting characters, all of whom I&#8217;m looking forward to following in the sequel."

From early scribbles to stick people families and maybe even something more, kids love to make art at an early age. This book shows kids all different types of art forms and artists. I like that the book talks about different styles that kids might not be familiar with on a regular basis. I also liked the lessons on creating art itself. The pictures were not just colorful but informational as well. The book keeps the kids engaged in the information and challenges them to think beyond the pages. This is a fantastic book for the young artist in your life."

"01 11, 2014",B00HR03O7W,5.0,The Pack or the Panther,A1TU1FRPVRWXFE,"There is so much that I liked about this book!  The characters are all so vivid and I especially liked Cole and Paris &#8211; our heroes.  Cole is just so endearing while Paris is adorable and fun.  They go well together because they balance each other so well.  Their conflict felt natural and made for a very compelling read.There are some hard parts, but the worst of it is short and it all only makes the characters stronger as people.  There&#8217;s a decent amount of shifting which I always appreciate in a shifter story, and the ending is just so sweet.  I can&#8217;t wait for more!The Pack or the Panther is an awesome start to what is sure to be a great new series from the fabulous Tara Lain.  Her books always grab my emotions and leave me happy, and this one is no exception."

"07 3, 2014",B00HTJJST4,5.0,Loved It!!!,A2HUU27IX9AX3T,"**I was gifted a copy of this book**This book was HOT and grabbed my attention from the very first chapter! Cooper and Kayla meet and have an instant attraction! Cooper is on his way to North Carolina to spend a few days before going overseas and Kayla is on her way to her sister's wedding. After Kayla admits her fear of flying, Cooper changes his seat on the plane and spends the entire flight using his awesome, sexy distraction techniques to get her to relax. Once Cooper becomes aware that Kayla has been lying to her family about an imaginary boyfriend, he offers to step into the role for a few days.&#34;Exactly. No attachments,&#34; he agreed, lowering his face. His lips almost touched hers. &#34;Just two people enjoying each other's company for a short time while pretending to be in love. What could possibly go wrong?&#34;What starts off as a no-strings attached relationship quickly turns into something more. I loved the connection between Cooper and Kayla and the development of their relationship. Definitely a fun, steamy romance!! Highly recommend!!"

"03 20, 2014",B00HWIIA2I,4.0,Unique Paranormal Romance.,A1V8JNUT1SOJEQ,"Special Forces officer and dragon shifter, Noah Easton sets off to find the hoard thief after escaping him and finds out the thief is now after his family. He's had to live apart from his family until their youngest child turns five years old for fear that his dragon might hurt the child but now that he's home maybe he can settle down and stay there.April Easton owns a tea shop and can read tea leaves to tell a persons future because she's an oracle. But she doesn't like to see her own future even when mother nature is sending her every sign it can think of to get her attention that something bad is on its way.If there's one lesson to be learned from this book it would be...Whatever you do, don't piss of a dragon shifter and don't go after his family. Especially one who is in the Special Forces. It's just not a good idea.April has abandonment issues and with what she's gone through, it's no wonder. She's emotionally broken and doesn't let anyone see underneath the facade she's put up to shield herself from being hurt the way her father hurt her when he abandoned her. So she's hoping she can make her husband see it's time to leave the military and stay home with his family.The mystery of who is stealing the hoard stones is revealed in this book and it's not the person anyone would have imagined. Secrets are revealed, surprises are thrown in their path and danger is lurking where they least expect it.While this book can be read as a stand alone it might make more sense if you read the first book in the series first. Some of the characters blend from the first book into this one. I really hope to see more of the characters from this story in upcoming books, especially Morgana and David.If you like dragons, magic, hot alpha males, hot steamy sex scenes and fight scenes full of action then you'll want to read this book.[...]"

"01 24, 2014",B00HZSGIDI,5.0,&#8220;The only way to have a friend is to be one.&#8221; - Ralph Waldo Emerson,A1E1LEVQ9VQNK,"The essayist and poet Ralph Waldo Emerson had it right: &#34;The only way to have a friend is to be one.&#34; Unfortunately for Kitty, she was arrogant, abusive, and condescending to the other animals, so they didn't want to be friends with her any more than she wanted to be their friend. Some people learn from their mistakes, but unfortunately for Kitty, she never got the message, so she remained lonely and spent most of her day whining.The story stops there, and it asks kids who are reading the story (or hearing it read by a parent) to think about why the other animals don't want to play with Kitty. The story offers parents a good opportunity to discuss friendship and what it means with their children. It's a valuable lesson for youngsters to learn at an early age, and Kitty's story illustrates very graphically why friendship is so important."

"02 19, 2014",B00I3QB160,3.0,OK but Simplistic,AR0N861NHCWXG,"I am not quite sure what to say about this book.  As someone else commented it is like a historical situation of BDSM.  It wasn't too badly written.  It was so not believable but that is fine in a book.  The characters were partially developed.  The storyline was there but nothing seemed to have much substance.  I definitely enjoyed the book as an average read, plenty of sex of all kinds, love but not the kind you can really feel like with other books, some minor suspense.  I would recommend it but don't expect a full fledged tantalizing read you can't put down."

"02 2, 2014",B00I6GNY80,5.0,Dylan's wonderful visitors help his fears vanish,A328S9RN3U5M68,"Israeli author Anat Umansky has written another of her unique and charming stories for children (she has written over a 100 books in Hebrew) and here she is aided by the fine illustrations by Helena Lis. According to her bio, `Anat loves to teach kids basic skills, through stories. She believes that a good story is the best way to communicate with children.'Dylan is a small boy who has scary thoughts, a fact he keeps a secret from his parents and even his baby sister. One night a white cloud appears in his room and on board the friendly cloud are two sleeping passengers - Michael the angel, and Fay the fairy. The cloud instructed the surprised and happy Dylan to wake up the sleeping Fay and Michael. Once awake Fay and Michael asked Dylan to share his secrets. As Dylan reveals his fears strange goblins, witches and monsters will come into his room at night and Fay and Michael tell him the scary things come from his thoughts: if he can do away with his scary thoughts he will have no fears. The bad creatures appear and a few adventures and attempts at kidnapping the fairy and the angel and Dylan finally realizes his problem, his secret: if he has no bad thoughts then there is nothing to fear. Off the cloud and the fairy and the angel go, their mission completed, and Dylan can now sleep dreaming of riding a fairy train to the land of angels and Candyland instead of goblins, witches and monsters.The illustrations enhance this charmer of a story and children will not only enjoy the wild adventure, but they will also learn how to conquer their fears of the dark - and the bad things that can hide there. This is a very empowering book for children of all ages. Grady Harp, February 14"
"02 1, 2014",B00I6M9EXS,5.0,Interesting characters and an engaging plot,A2V9CJQBGND5AD,"Mushrooms.  How can a book about mushrooms keep you engaged and entertained?  Somehow Buroker makes it happen.  Tara is a girly girl - she drives a pink convertible, wears lavender nail polish and likes living in the city.  But for the summer she's out on the Olympic Peninsula  at an eco village to write about living in a sustainable community.  But almost immediately she runs into trouble in the form of the village's hunky neighbor who is currently feuding with the village.  And someone is leaving dead animals around the village and wandering in the forest at night looking for something.This was a light, fun read - I enjoyed the characters and their interactions.  The plot was fun - complete with Buroker's traditional explosions that her fans have come to love.  I enjoyed every minute of this and found myself giggling through several parts.  And I even learned about mushrooms!"
"02 24, 2014",B00I6ZS6IE,2.0,Its an okay book to read.,ARH2P6YQBXJD9,This story had so much potential but sad to say it did not. There's a music festival in glastobury england that Megan a music instructor is needing to attend to finish her phd in music and to pursue a reclusive ageing singer Davy Morgan whom was her teen idol and still is. Little does she know that her hero is a time traveler and goes back an fourth from 1971 to the now time 2014. It takes a lil time to figure out what his doing in the meantime the cottage she's staying on has plumbing issues and the writer spends to much time on that should have expanded on the ex boyfriend  back in australia a little more. They hook up and that was that. No twists or what the heck moments. Sorry I hate giving bad reviews but it could some the time and money if they got an honest review. Thanks for the free book Entanglement.
"03 17, 2014",B00I78HDFW,3.0,Nothing Amazing,A1DU1CJEP60TLQ,"-- SPOILER ALERT!!! --Once again it looks like I'm alone here when I say that I didn't enjoy the book as much as so many others did which is evident by all the four and five star ratings. If they loved it that's great, I'm happy for them. When I read the synopsis and some of the reviews, I was quite intrigued with it. However, half-way thru I found myself quickly skimming thru it just to end it sooner.So, what bothered me? I found the hero/heroine characters to be flat. The heroine, Brooke, I didn't hate her, but I didn't love her either. I just couldn't understand what it was about her that attracted our hero to her. Yes, she's beautiful, attractive, and smart, but what else? And then there's Gavin who is absolutely gorgeous, handsome, sexy, ""stunning"" and ""Grecian-like god"" with an English accent. Besides his looks and being so nice, and the fact that every single woman wanted to be thoroughly screwed by him, I didn't get a sense of what was so special about him.As for the supporting characters, I have to say I wasn't too impressed with them. I thought it was quite obvious to the reader who the ""other woman"" was. I would think her actions that went overboard would make it a little obvious. (I'll be nice and not mention the woman's name.)Now before anyone becomes irate and thinks I'm nuts or too critical and harsh, reading this novel for me was like watching a bad daytime soap opera, only instead of adults they're all teens. All they did from beginning to end was gossip, gossip, gossip wherever and whenever they got together, always about who was doing who, naturally. They were all so immature, like 14 year-old teens smiling and giggling about boys. Who doesn't love gossip? I do but filling the pages with texting and running back and forth from office-to-office to gossip about every little thing? Give me a break.While this novel is categorized as a paranormal-romance, I thought little was dedicated to the paranormal aspect. Yes, I understand who Gavin was and what his deep dark desires are and what made him that way, but more paranormal would've made for a more intriguing novel. It certainly makes an appearance towards the end, but still, to me it was just a novel of pure romance with lots and lots of sexcapades thrown in. Don't get me wrong, the sex is off-the-charts hot and I loved it. I just thought there was way too much of it going on and not enough story. After a while it becomes a little redundant, and for a novel that's 574 pages I thought there'd be a more substance to the actual story.The whole thing about Brooke not going to HR to file a sexual harassment complaint against Dan was ridiculous. He says it's his word against hers. Seriously? His numerous inappropriate texts to her is evidence, and stalking her and her friends on the weekends means nothing? Then hire a lawyer, kick him in the nuts. Who'd put up with that s*** every day at work?So, should you read ""Bound to the Fallen,""  or skip it? I'm not going to tell you anything. I'll leave it up to you. As for book 2 of the ""Prophecy,""  series - I'm going to take a pass."
"05 31, 2014",B00I7EOX68,5.0,The Silent Reporter,A3FZGYH5RNZ9F7,"When I first started reading this book I though it was awfully slow. I'm glad I stayed with it, it was a good mystery."
"06 10, 2014",B00I7EOX68,3.0,Good story idea but needs a better editor,A3QQ8YCYZ6V575,"This is an interesting murder mystery that touches upon several themes, including religion, truth, and community. It would have earned a 4 or 5 star rating though with the following edits:* no grammatical errors (&#34;passed&#34; vs &#34;past&#34;, really?)* less focus on the detective's alcoholism (took up too much unnecessary page time)* more focus on the female lead's perspective (the story materializes because of her father, you think she would have more of a presence)Overall it's an entertaining read that kept me excited but it may not be up to par for people who frequently read murder mysteries. I'm confident the author could go farther if the above points were addressed and s/he fleshed out certain themes or situations in more detail."

It is a definite &#34;I can NOT put this book down!!!&#34; type book - which, for me, Tawdra is noted for.This story of Rafe and Tasmyn is amazing. We get to see what Rafe does immediately following graduation and how he copes with what life has dealt him. After graduation, Rafe goes on a road trip - with lots girls and booze.  He goes from city to city - trying to drown his broken heart.  While in New Orleans, he encounters a girl names Joss and his life changes.I hate when people post spoilers in their reviews and I REFUSED to do that.

"06 19, 2014",B00I8R7BWM,5.0,I loved it!!!,A2ZSLJG2KBCR3E,"This is a wonderful love story of Bromwyn who is direct, honest and has that Scottish Fire. Andrew is good on his word, loyal and a gentle Englishman. They have a comfortable ease and fire between them that only comes from love. I laughed at the little Scottish healer, Morag who was a dried up little old lady when she pinched the big brawny black-tempered Scotsman Roy and put him in his place. Daira is Drew's past lover and she does and says horrible things to keep Brommie and Drew apart. Sometimes love can't be contained within one century, but must transcend space and time. So be sure and get Celtic Spirit to read about Rory. You will love Ria's books as I have. You will stay on pins and needles to see what happens. Way to go Ria for another great book."

"03 20, 2014",B00ID8MAJU,5.0,Appealing!,A5JZNVV4TEAWU,"Reviewed by Jen Bfor TheRomanceReviews.comIn DARK DUKE, Sabrina York brings us to the somewhat darker side of Regency naughty, but she makes it so appealing you wish you were there to experience it!Edward Wyeth, the Duke of Moncrieff, known as the Dark Duke throughout society, has suddenly been invaded by his relatives from Scotland, turning his normally quiet household completely upside down. As the author of the scandalous novels by Lord Hedon, he finds it impossible to continue writing his novels with so many distractions. While finding peace in a long forgotten library, his cousin's companion, Kaitlin MacAllister, stumbles in. With her hair down and her nightgown that shows all her curves in the light, Edward finds himself desperate to have her in every way he can.Kaitlin has fled Scotland with Violet, the duke's cousin, to avoid a betrothal her brother sold her into. Posing as Violet's companion, she does her best to stay away from all men. While not an innocent maid, scandal has forced Kaitlin to avoid men and she finds their insistence in coming on to her annoying. But when the duke makes his intentions clear to her, she cannot stop herself from giving in to him and her body's demands, especially after reading some of Lord Hedon's writings. All seems to be going well when Violet is kidnapped in the hopes of forcing Kaitlin back to Scotland. While Edward has a plan to fix everything, unwilling to let Kaitlin go, she sneaks off to solve things on her own. Now Edward must find a way to save both the woman he loves and his cousin from a man whose name alone causes fear.This third installment of the Noble Passions series was, in my opinion, the best so far. Edward and Kaitlin had so much chemistry together and enjoyed each other a lot, making it hard to put the book down. Like so many heroines, Kaitlin feels she is responsible for her problems and doesn't want Edward to risk himself for her. She is such a strong character that I was really drawn to her. Edward was just sizzling and you could almost feel the heat of him through the pages. In fact, this book was so hot, you may find yourself in need of a fan to cool off while reading it! Highly recommended and cannot wait for the next one."

Each one of them was a lovable character for different reasons and I can't wait to read each one of their stories.I loved Riley, the heroine, the way she hated the country and her terrible fear of cows!Cooper is great. A hot country boy turned Wall Street wannabe - I loved him both ways.Although it all happened a little too fast and way too intensely to be real, who cares?

"02 17, 2014",B00IGB0W1M,5.0,Space Opera gets real.,AOVU2XUK51LOL,"The latest offering from this author has suddenly evolved from fantasy to a hard hitting story with life lessons on offer, and I loved absolutely everything about it. It is brilliantly written by an author who obviously understands that regardless of where and when we live in the universe, the human condition stays the same.I have been introduced to Zyra before, but in this story a vulnerable Zyra is laid open for all the galaxy to see. Suddenly she transforms into a young women who still has a lot to learn about life, and love in particular. Regardless of how life has treated her, there is still an innocence about Zyra Zanr that becomes evident in this chapter of the series. Zyra, as we all know, has the ability to get herself caught in a web of her own conjuring over and over again, and it would seem not much has changed. The author however, really turns up the heat in this book, and it sometimes leaves you feeling quite vulnerable yourself.Zyra is and will always be a survivor, but once again she comes dangerously close to being in way over her head. Falling in love might seem like the right thing to do, but is this love the right thing for Zyra Zanr? She becomes the only one who can answer this question.Dr Ryan seems sincere and truly concerned with a strange illness imbedding itself in Zyra's body, and apart from the fact that he's married, Ryan still seems to love everything about Zyra. Early on in the story there are subtle hints that Ryan has a dark side and that things are not quite what they seem.The author honestly gives us a wonderfully seductive story of love, growth, abuse and the controversial world of genetic engineering. All of this set in the vastness of space, leaving you panting for more."

The writer is really good with her descriptions and expressions to situations.I was priviledged enough to have a word with the author before I purchased the book (NO SHE IS NOT MY FRIEND. WE JUST HAPPENED TO MEET) and she says the book shows her life. I can only imagine and hope that she over exergerated most of the drama otherwise those experiences were terrible.However, if they are all true, she is indeed a brave young lady and I salute her. With these experiences, I do hope she is able to help other women who are in a fix out there.This book is good and recommendable. I will be getting the next one in que."

The details described in this book would help any parent or guardian who&#8217;s child has these symptoms. I have 2 children that are 3 years old and 10 months old, and I plan to have more so I&#8217;m really glad I have read this book.

The author lays out a number of &#8220;games&#8221; women play with the men who are courting them, and helps provide ways the men can respond to those games. The book offers funny and helpful ways to avoid these tests, and good responses when avoidance isn&#8217;t possible.Lothario has a bit of a misogynistic bent to this book, but overall the book is just straightforward and honest about the ways that women and men court. Even after marriage, these tests still come up from time to time, and this book has helped me recognize when my wife is testing me, as well as how to &#8220;pass the test.&#8221;"

"04 29, 2014",B00IJZBPL6,4.0,Anatomy of Police Procedure,ASQW8Y9DY6LM6,"A farmer is on his way home one night, and runs out of gas. A garage (what we would later call service stations) is not too far up the road, so he hikes the short distance to find his petrol. Instead, he finds one of the garage owners in a car, dead from carbon monoxide poisoning. It looks to be a suicide, with one problem: the young garage owner had no reason to kill himself.Enter Inspector Meredith of the county police force. Meredith doesn&#8217;t accept the idea of suicide. Only a very few clues suggest otherwise, but Meredith doggedly stays at it. And more clues pointing to murder begin to surface.&#34;The Lake District Murder,&#34; written by Ernest Carpenter Elmore (1901-1957) under the name of John Bude, was first published in 1935, the same year his first crime novel, &#34;The Cornish Coast Murder,&#34; was published. Both books were recently republished by the British Library.&#34;The Cornish Coast Murder&#34; is a classic whodunit investigation, the kind widely popularized by Agatha Christie. &#34;The Lake District Murder&#34; is a very different kind of crime story. The focus is not so much on the identity of the murderer as it is the reconstruction of the crime and the process by which the police determine what actually happen.And the murder is only the smallest part of the story. The author&#8217;s successful intention is to tell the story of painstaking analysis, investigation, footwork, wrong turns, new developments, tedium, hunches, and good fortune that is crime detection and investigation.  The novel reads more like a contemporary account than a book published almost 80 years ago.The story centers on the geography of area involved in the criminal investigation (England&#8217;s Lake District) and the geography of the mind of Inspector Meredith. The reader travels the roads and lanes and small towns of the area, and travels with Meredith as he pieces his investigation together.Kudos to the British Library for republishing these entertaining and fascinating novels by John Bude."
"04 20, 2014",B00IK6BE6U,5.0,Nice gluten-free dessert recipes,A1LLPMWYSB1BGQ,"This is a really good collection of gluten-free dessert recipes and the Peanut Butter Swirl Brownies sound especially mouth watering to me. The author has also included shop links to where the special flours such as almond flour, coconut flour, amaranth flour or teff flour can be bought which is useful as I have often struggled to find these flours in supermarkets and can find it difficult to know what to recommend to others when they ask where they can purchase these items. Lemon and coconut are two of my favourite flavours so I will also be trying out the lemon coconut cupcakes. If you have a sweet tooth but have to be careful with sweet baked goods because of gluten, then this is the perfect dessert book for you."

"06 25, 2014",B00IKAGM54,4.0,Deeply emotional read!,AXBPOMEELERLZ,"The Harder I Fall is an incredibly emotional read.  There were so many moments when I just wanted to reach inside my Kindle and hug Becca and make things right for her and her brother.  I empathized and related to so many aspects of this story and it made the entire book that much more meaningful.Becca is an amazing girl, intelligent and caring and strong beyond her years.  Her life has been tumultuous at best and deeply wounding at worst.  She is broken inside and she has come to accept that she will never be able to live a normal life.  That made it all the more sweet and romantic when her life began to change.  Enter Levi, an amazing guy with some issues of his own.  He starts out as the perfect Book Boyfriend, but as it always happens, there comes a time when he loses some of his shine.  But the beauty of the story doesn't end with Levi.  There is beauty in the friendships she has with her roommate Sadie and her boyfriend Julian, also Levi's best friend.  There is also the unexpected family she finds, a family that shows what family should really be about.I'm not going to lie... the ending shocked me!  A good ending, but unexpected!Things to love...--Sadie.  Kind, patient, and caring... everything a best friend should be, something that Becca needed in her life.--Levi's parents.  And I can't explain why without spoiling a fantastic story line!--The deep and dark issues of life.  They were dark, but they were real and poignant.My Recommendation:  Fantastic contemporary romance!  I am reading the pre-release copy of the next book in the series, The Deeper We Get, and it is FANTASTIC!!  I gave this one a 4.5 mugs!"
"02 25, 2014",B00IKBQNZM,5.0,"Darn you, Nia Forrester!",ANQ2XK0R1DBKU,"Five Stars. I loved it. I didn't even want to READ Mistress because I had NO interest in Keyshia. I thought I knew who she was and I loathed her. But of course, Ms. Forrester- masterful writer that she is- made me kind of like her by the end of Mistress and to root for her in Wife. One of the things I love best about this author is the fact that none of her characters are one-note. No one person is all good or all bad. Any one of them can at any time make you want to hug them or shake them till their teeth click. I love that she makes me FEEL when I read her stories and I love that I feel like I know all of these people. I love that they are all flawed and just trying to get better and do better. Just like all of us. I'm excited for the next book."

I have always had trouble with procrastination and not being very productive in any area of my life - so a friend recommended this book to me - all i can say - i have great friends :-)My key takeaway was the system of organizing my day in a way i never really have done before.. And what shocked me after making my own plan is that i am now actually really excited to get to work on whatever task i have in front of me. To me this is HUGE!I already feel lighter and see progress. So my verdict... Recommended read!

Barbarians are strong, but barbarian princesses must be even stronger, and I love how Ivy uses her strength in more ways than just by the sword. Goliaths always seemed like ugly brutes, but Lukor shows they are more like us than we think. I loved how Zoltack takes an unlikely pairing and makes it work. The world-building transports the reader to a unique fantasy place with goliaths, trolls, elves, barbarians, and humans. They are different yet similar and all must find a way to survive within their realm. Fast-paced and action-packed, Bloodlust by Nicole Zoltack twists classic fantasy romance upon its head and creates a unique world and characters a reader can root for."

This was Bryces' story. It is fast paced and full of interesting parts.You meet the alpha, his mate and other family members, as well as characters from her previous books. This is not a full erotic book that details each love scene. It is PG rated and as you finish this book you will want to know what happened to the other brothers.A fast read and good book except for the many typos and mispellings and abundance of commas."

"03 11, 2014",B00INBBWPK,4.0,I'm In Love.....Thunder  Anyone.... A Must Read,AXV7E488BQWYW,"I love the characters from this book, I really do they are the highlight in my opinion.BTW I'm rubbish at spoiler free reviews.....I'm not going to lie at first I was a little sceptical of the story because it started off so strong and stories that start of strong sometimes  fade during the middle and then pick up at the end and I effing hate that. But to my surprise the Author  kept  the intensity all the way throughout adding layers and layers as the story went on.The pace was done to perfection at first I taught Oh Gosh it's going to be too long but it worked out perfectly everything was skilfully laid out in great details.It's more than value for money, this is a complete story with an ending not just half a story that will leave you unsatisfied and peed offThe writing is good with a good flow that is easy to follow despite all the technical jargon and all the British slang and terms. Ivy our leading lady who is British and I mean normal British that is spoken by everyday people, not the Queens formal English but a little Cockney which I love because I'm a Londoner.I admire Ivy's character she has real strength and agility,  during all the madness of nearly everyone trying to kill her and being terrified she still has a smilel on her face she made those around her smile she is truly a light force.&#34;I was having a vision of you standing in the jungle like John Rambo shooting your way through Small's and the jungle.&#34;IvyI had such a great time getting to know her character, she free spirit just flowing from the pages.She had a very limited sexual experience up until meeting Thunder. I loved her openness to learn new thing to please her man her method of research is hilarious. I really love her character her back story is also very touching and a bit sad really she was a loner until Maria claimed her as friend upon meeting her.As I said before the characters are the highlight of the book, all their individual personality shone through but not over shadowing the main characters I fell for the whole gang I wanted one of those badass all for myself and to be &#34;Part Of The Gang&#34;Thunder where so I even begin with him.....His name fits him perfectly he is defiantly a force to be reckoned with especially if you mess with his women. Swoon. He as survived a hell of a lot during his 36 years on earth he carries some pretty heavy baggage but Ivy gives him a reason to want to put the pass behind him and finally move one. My heart truly broke form him and the way he suffered. I had to swallow down quite a few massive lumps that formed in my throat his pain was raw and palatable from the pages they nearly suffocated me because I  really came  to like him as a &#34;person&#34; (Individual character) before the true depths of his previous despair is revealed.He is an Alpha male without a doubt but he is unlike most you we normally read about he is not too possessive or jealous he is  secure in their love for each other and he also understand that his friends has fallen for her just as he had but not in a sexual way his boys treat her like a sister and best friend he does not get peed of and act like a jerk which is a refreshing change.Thunder's circle of men that work for him are all extremely handsome and massive, when Ivy meets them for the first time of course she checked them out openly right in front of Thunder I could not believe he just made a joke about her doing so......that made me love him so much more I absolutely love the way he is written.One thing is for sure Thunder and Ivy belonged together, they are soul mates from the very early on it was crystal clear their fate was destined and I love how their loved developed once I got over that almost instant  love thing (I just really wanted his POV to fully grasp where he was coming from). I rooted and cheer for them like a bloody mad women I wanted them to get that HEA so badly that they both deserve.&#34;I love you too baby. I've loved you from the moment I saw you. I knew then what I know now. I would go to the ends of the earth for you Ivy. Before I met you, I was surviving...barely. You're my reason for existing. Without you; I was living in a dark hole, praying that every day I woke up would be my last, but my soul knew you were close; Ii wouldn't let me give up. For You, I carried on living, hoping,knowing deep down you were coming for me. &#34;That says it all, I have nothing more to say about these beautiful two. Well I have plenty more but I'm shutting up for obvious reasons...... I'm no blabber mouth.Deep Haven is not your typical romance its original  and fresh. Ms Tuitt should be commended for her originality and in this type of stagnant market where everything is so much alike its incredibly brave of her to choose this path but I think it paid of I will remember this story for a long time unlike the ones that all blend together. I enjoyed the references to several TV program that I watch (I love my telly time)The ending was most perfect, loved every minute. There is also a bonus chapter that pacified my heart after moaning about not have Thunder's POV so we all got a happy ending......4 Solid, page turning, funny, action packed stars.P.S There is some great sex that will get you all HOT and Bothered trust me I highly recommend. Its absolutely scandalous **Wink wink**XOXO Natasha"

I wonder if they just sit home and eat bonbons and practice target shooting. Here's a tip!  THEY DON'T!  They go on cool adventures and like, life, they are exactly where they need to be to set up for the NEXT BIG novel.  In this set we get a good gander of the man, Deep Blue and we get to hang out and delve deeper into Knight.  These are awesome reads and fill in the spaces of the characters.  If you haven't read the Chess Team series by Jeremy Robinson, SERIOUSLY?  Go! Then read these! :)"
"03 3, 2014",B00IOWB9S8,5.0,Loved it,A3TWR490KZFD1U,"I loved this story. This story shows a different perspective on the old kidnapping plot. This kidnapping was gentle and caring and though Nicholas was attracted to Alexandria it was clear her health was his priority. At 85 pounds, Alexandria is very sick but she is not willing to give up control as easily as Nicholas would like. Nicholas comes from a family of alpha males. These men love their wives with all that they are but they have expectations, too. Alexandria quickly finds out that when expectations are not met, she will be spanked. I loved all of the negotiations that went on between Nicholas and Alexandria. They were quite humorous. I liked the involvement of his family and the loyalty they had for each other. Alexandria's issues were new and interesting from how they manifested to how she chose to deal with them. I can't think of anything I disliked in this story. I'm sure this is one that I will read over and over."

No fault of the story, just my buying choice."
"06 24, 2014",B00IP1CTT6,5.0,Perfect and Bittersweet,A1DJCR1E71SR2C,"A perfect but bittersweet conclusion to an awesome series.  I felt that the author handled the love triangle very well and Rachel was not a fickle person emotionally.  She understood her situation and clearly knew her priorities.  In this book, you see a different side to Drew and understood how his upbringing had molded him into the person he was. Rachel saw the goodness in him and gave him love that he so desperately needed. There were a lot of twists and turns and I found myself not knowing who to trust and what were their real intentions."

It has a great storyline, and it keeps the bride's family involved throughout the whole book so that we can see how their life develops once the main character leaves.  This series does NOT have to be read in any particular order, as they are not connected, so you can start here with my favorite and then read the rest for some other great stories!"

"05 16, 2014",B00IRO0RMM,5.0,Loved it!,A29HNTMHG0J8K9,"This was the 2nd book in the series and I really loved it.  If you have not read these books (Never Close Enough or Never Far Away) you really should.This book made me fall in love with Porter all over again.  I loved how he stood by her side even when she didn't want him too.  Ella and Porter were the perfect couple but just had a few bumps to get over.  Without giving to much away on the book, Porter had to work hard for his love of Ella and Ella had to put trust in Porter to make their relationship work. I am glad at the end that they both got what they wanted and I am glad that I got to read these books.  If you want to know what happens to Ella and Porter, get these books, you will not be disappointed!  Thank you Anie Michaels for writing the perfect love story.  You did a fantastic job!"
"03 22, 2014",B00ISENHNM,5.0,Love the book,AOFEF95ER28BO,"I hope Jordan and Julie get what they deserve. Prime example of a man who doesn't know a good thing when he has one. Megan deserves more. With that being said, I can't wait for book 2."
"03 5, 2014",B00ISV7NK8,5.0,Really Sasha!!!!!,A2VZX2185GI4DZ,"Wow....Jealousy is  the devil.... Once again CJ has did it. This book was a page turner from the start.  I really enjoyed the rolling through the KD`s world.  I love how much Don states he loves Meaka, but the both need help in showing it.  If you haven't started this series you don't know what your missing.  It's a banger!!!! Can't wait for part 3"
"03 26, 2014",B00ITV0LDS,5.0,great read for people who suffer from anxiety and depression,A24U7D82LA536T,"I have suffered from depression in the past and I think this book was quite helpful. I was really pleased with the amount of information this book has. I think this book covers a bit more about anxiety though, and I particularly found the chapter about the 10 secrets to anxiety self-help very helpful as a lot of my family members suffer from anxiety."
"07 2, 2014",B00IVKQUO6,1.0,A perfect example of how not to write Military SF,A2QNCA086G8SF0,"The only redeeming feature was the action scenes, but they were by no means enough to rescue this one.First, if you are going to write high tech SF, try and have some understanding of science and technology.- You can't ignite plasma like some jet of gasoline- Lasers don't shoot Ions, and are NOT interchangeable with particle cannons.- They have a plasma engine that can get around the solar system in a few hours, yet have no compensation so would arrive as a thin paste.. Same with zipping in and out of asteroids.- You, OMG, shoot a grapple at a speeding Fighter and don't get you arms ripped off?Second, try typing and not rambling into some voice recognition software. So many phonetic errors my eyes are bleeding- Do and Due are not interchangeable- You Don a helmet, not Dawn it- Coarse is not the same as Course, but you could set a coarse course...Plot difficulties are huge and numerous. Hire an editor, a friend, someone who finished high school english.- An alien empire has rendered themselves incapable of violence, not had a warrior in 1000 years, and somehow still has defended their border with a fleet and is considering a surprise attack. Eh what?- Minutes after his fighter is rescued, a pilot is thrown into a Marine unit on a mission. Not a chance- A LARGE number of units is attacking, later in the sentence it become 5 Fighters. not exactly large by any fashion.- The Earth fleet has 800 fighter in one scene and pages later 100 destroyed is more than half.I don't ask for refunds or return books, but this may well be the first. I am embarrassed I read 80% before running screaming."
"05 2, 2014",B00IVOMXYI,5.0,Highly recommended,ADQ6Q36FUUDO,"This wasn't my first Kate Kelly book, and it won't be the last. She just gets better and better. Great mix of romance and suspense, and keeps you wondering how she's going to pull of a happily ever after for Rafe and Bridget. Sigh worthy. It also stands alone nicely, but it's even better if you've read the other books in this Stolen Hearts series."
"03 12, 2014",B00IW8ADMW,3.0,Could of been great,A2PNKOGE9W7XJ3,"This book was okay HOWEVER  it could have been excellent. When this book came up and I read the introduction  I rushed to order it because it sounded excellent. It is such a quick read, so very much to the point that it was a bit disappointing. I think that the author was onto a terrific story but the characters needed to be developed and there needed to be more background and details to the story. The fact that Annie was kidnapped and was a sex slave should have been expanded on. The relationship between Annie and Patrick also should have been more detailed. I mean they went through so much but it didn't read like that. The relationship between Annie and her parents was really disappointing. I wanted to know more about them and their relationship. There could have been more drama there. Also, another good idea was to have Annie's POV in the same book.So anyway this is the story of Annie who was kidnapped off a cruise ship and held as a sex slave for 5 years. Patrick goes to a brothel and happens upon Annie. Annie quietly asks him for help. Since he is a Navy Seal and proud and honorable he helps her."
"03 19, 2014",B00IWBT11I,5.0,Devil is just so bad,A1ZYYNTJWTL35G,"If you've read The Skulls series then you already know who Devil is. If not - he is the Devil. He just wants to be bad and the second you forget that...you're dust.I loved the idea that Devil is combing the U.S. for his son and happens to find him in the arms of his new found crush (I use that word LOOSELY).The chemistry between Lexie and Devil is instant and uncompromising. And when they finally get between the sheets I guarantee it'll knock your socks off. I enjoyed the story; the action, the love scenes, everything."
"07 10, 2014",B00IWCSJGA,5.0,I can't wait for the next one,AFC67EKZ7YPOY,"This was a wonderful paranormal/alien novel with romantic times. There are minor glitches that are easy to overlook both in editing and as a general reader (like by instead of my or the word to twice: to to) that I am sure an overly critical person may complain of. But I found they did not affect the quality of enjoying the story spin by  the author. She is able to tell it so that you feel more as if you are watching the thing unfold than reading it.My only personal complaint is right as the tension starts rising, it becomes a cliff hanger and ends. I kept flipping between the last page and the one reading the end hoping I'd missed a page and there was more story. Can't wait for a sequel!!!!!I received this free for honest review"
"03 21, 2014",B00IX8NCMO,4.0,Very good!,A3QE57L9N3H4EL,"I am just loving this series!  Twists,turns and fun characters . I can not wait for the next book in this series!"
"03 30, 2014",B00IY5RIXA,3.0,Just Okay,A1OUDZ04L16GK1,"I really wanted to love this one. The premise for the story sounded so good and some of my favorite Hero's are military ones living and fictional. However, most of the story took place inside the H and h's head with very little dialogue. Although there was a lot of back story that help to establish the story line not enough communication and way to much inter thoughts."
"07 18, 2014",B00IY5RX80,4.0,Library Kink,A1E1IGWRW974JG,"Favorite Quotes:&#34;Just because I'm a lonely librarian, doesn't mean I dress frumpy.&#34;You're quite beautiful Ms. Banning.  I feel like my dirty librarian fantasies of my youth are all about to come true tonight.&#34;My Review:Oh my, what a naughty little tale.  This was a brief but eventful little interlude, and oddly, it mostly believable.  Swoon, I would even consider volunteering at my local library if such delicious adventures could possibly occur there."
"04 22, 2014",B00IYINKVG,5.0,A Great Book,A2I7DJ64JZEOD7,"A Great Book, this book really gets into Caesar's personality, character. Telling me things about the famous general I never knew. Great book, amazing job author."
"03 25, 2014",B00IYTSCMM,5.0,Love literature and music combo!,A3D096XQTNXMCM,"What I loved about this book: I admit it, I'm a sucker for books about fame. I love to see how different characters (and people) handle fame, and how they balance the limelight with their personal lives. So I was particularly attracted to Sebastian, and later Eva, when she was being brought into his world. Another wonderful thing about this book (and their companion novels) is the music that goes along with it. I've always loved the idea of joining the arts and creating new combinations of expression. I love the idea of music and literature (especially in a book about a musician!) that Lee Strauss has come up with."
"05 16, 2014",B00IZ4WP5Q,5.0,Sweet story,A21CRF6SRA5TMS,"This is the 2nd book of the series.  Caroline is returning to her home in Chicago after persuading Elizabeth to take her place as a mail order bride.  Caroline is a widow and discovered that she just couldn&#8217;t marry again without love.

Royce has discovered that he is in love with the feisty young widow and tells her they will be married.  This is a sweet, romantic love story with some spicy spanking scenes.  If you like an easy, romantic read, you&#8217;ll love this one."
"04 15, 2014",B00IZRAPKK,5.0,AN AMAZING LOVE STORY,A3FW06OAUGJ884,"I had the joy of reading this alarmingly beautiful story immediately after Incomplete, the first in the series. I didn&#8217;t have to wait, which was fantastic because I just NEEDED more Grayson and Lily. The first story is written from Grayson&#8217;s point of view and this story, Complete, is written from Lily&#8217;s. I just love that. It was amazing to get her take on things.The one word that I would use to describe Lily is strong. She is far stronger than I ever thought to be. To give up the man that she loves with every fiber of her being just so he could pursue his life and dream is amazing. The story picks up two years after the ending of Complete. Lily is miserable. Grayson is miserable. Life is just not right when they are not together. Plain and simple. Getting thrust back together in their hometown is what finally brings their relationship back into the light. It&#8217;s very clear that there is confusion and hard feelings between Grayson and Lily. I wanted to scream at the book, JUST BE HONEST. They are both so guarded. Which, to be fair, is understandable, but yet, as a reader you just know that they are meant to be. Some things just ARE and Grayson and Lily just are.There are ups and downs. There are more trials in this book that they both have to overcome. There is more heartbreak and devastation. But the unconditional love that is profound and true and real between them is what shines through the madness.I simple loved and will always cherish this relationship. They are honest and that really hit home. I HIGHLY recommend you read and fall in love with Grayson and Lily.5 HUGE smooches~Nicole"
"03 19, 2014",B00IZS01DU,5.0,Beautiful romance with a nice HEA,AJUPEI2OY5GDM,"This is a short, but beautifully written romance. The love at first sight aspect makes the romance move quickly, however the author draws a wonderful picture of the feelings that Constance and Charles have for each other. This story will make you believe in true love!For those that don't like to read sexually graphic stories, there is one sex scene that is quite mildly detailed. In my opinion, it shows the love and passion that exists between two people deeply in love."
"04 13, 2014",B00J0LXXIQ,5.0,Holy wow!!,A1EDALBEXJ1R6M,"The drama just got good!! Wow I was left with so many holes from book one, those are filled in and now I have new ones!! Wow after the bomb about Liz and Mark in book 1 and the secrecy of Jax in it I didn't think I could get sucked in more but by god I did. Now I'm left wanting all the gory details of Brooke and what will happen with Nathan. Just when Ivy thought she was back on track it all comes to a screeching halt at the end and I'm left with a horrible book hang over. MUST READ THIS SERIES.. REPEAT ONE CLICK NOW!!"
"07 8, 2014",B00J15DSFY,4.0,Awesome read!,A1B344UGWZRQJ,Arnold is one of my freakin' awesome idol! Though I'm still having a little bit of problem saying his last name though but that doesn't matter :P The book is absolutely entertaining and probably one of my most &#34;read again&#34; book.
"06 13, 2014",B00J19FBR8,5.0,"Clear, Concise Directions",ARSYHA10UT6S4,"This is probably one of the most complete books about Kindle publishing I've read. It's a very in depth analysis of how to make money with kindle .It is written in a clean, conversational format, which makes it easy to get through and really soak in the information.

"03 28, 2014",B00J1JAOLG,4.0,Stop!  Don't spend money on ineffective cures for acne,A1BK4RJFNMKBC8,"Short and to the point, just as we all hope our experiences with acne are.  It was interesting to read the various home cures for treating the skin with kindness and gentleness.  Often families buy high priced and ineffective &#34;cures&#34; promoted by TV gurus who are ore interested in gaining money than gaining clear and healthy skin.Thanks for a good job, Judy Helm Wright, author and parent educator"
"03 26, 2014",B00J1R63MM,5.0,A Beautiful and Emotional Story,A28MJ3SKGG49F3,When I had the chance to review this book I totally jumped at the chance due to the title and the book being about Firefighters.  My great-grandfather had died in the line of duty he had his last call.  He was a Captain of the Fire Dept.  My Grandfather &#34;Grampy Gus&#34; was a retired Captain as well of the Fire Dept.  Although I wasn't around when he was on the Fire Dept it always had a special place.  All Firefighters do.  The Sacrifices they make are priceless and much appreciated.  I thank all the men and women who are Firefighters.  With that being said here is my review.Lennox a mom of two and a Firefighter's wife.  Even though she was alone a lot it was a common thing for the wives and they joked they were &#34;single moms&#34;.  Lennox misses her husband Dean. He isn't around much due to his schedule.  Something had been lost over time and didn't know if it was possible or not.  Does she or doesn't she find all that is lost between her and Dean?  Does the family become whole again?I can relate to Lennox my first husband was a truck driver and he was gone a lot and the depression sunk in just like it did for Lennox.  I also had two small children and all I wanted to do was sleep or just do what ever. I didn't care if the house was a mess or not.  Depression is a very serious thing.  There is help out there and no one is alone.  It is amazing how I can relate to Lennox.  Especially when you sit and think back to when you met your spouse and then you sit and wonder where everything went that you once shared.I really enjoyed this story and thought Dani did a wonderful job writing it.  Make sure you have your tissues handy. Very emotional book.
"04 9, 2014",B00J1VS7C2,3.0,Not a complete story!,A3QILB1XDU8OC4,Well not bad for the start of a story. But I'm not sure that I would pay to read any more books to finish the story. This half was free and if the other half is also then I will be reading it.
"04 3, 2014",B00J2C9P3U,5.0,I Love this Book!,A2NO1NMB0TDQ5A,"I am a fan of Gloria Daniels! After reading her book 'Container Gardening, Season by Season', I jumped at her new book. The information in this book is very well organized and explained in great detail. There is so much valuable information... fertilizing tips, watering, keeping your plants healthy, information on mineral deficiencies, controlling pests, container gardening with children and much, much more. There is even recipes for you to try after you grow those beautiful vegetables!I can't wait to try the recipe for new seedlings and plants that she has shared in this book (she got this simple recipe from a longtime gardener friend).If you're looking to expand your knowledge about growing vegetables in containers, you will not be disappointed in this book. Pick up a copy today!"
"05 2, 2014",B00J2DZITO,4.0,"Loved the first two, not so much the last",AM7T8J8O2JJWI,"I loved the first two parts of this series and couldn't wait for the third.  But I was rather disappointed in The Escape.  I guess I expected a little more details about the escape and something about Vincent's growing fondness of Aaron.  The ending kind of threw me, making it seem like there might be sequels..."
"03 19, 2014",B00J2JNE1C,5.0,Worth the wait!,A34KD80BAXVOZ3,"Freaking waited for EVER for book two...but it was well worth the wait! I love the love/hate thing between Toni and Sebastian. I loved how a man played the hard to get role, instead of the woman. Miss Parker did it again. Now if I could just be patient enough for book 3:)"
"04 3, 2014",B00J2JW4MM,5.0,Easy Weight Loss. It's True!,A3BUJBD7QFLYTU,"Whenever I cut down, not even eliminate, on carbs, I see the results on the scale.  Cut out the high carb junk food and I'll lose weight.  This book gives you background on the Atkins, South Beach, Scarsdale, Paleo and Zone diets, among others. Serving sizes are also discussed.  I liked this book for it's down to earth explanations. It's not that hard to have a normal diet and still lose weight.  Brian explains it all!"
"04 12, 2014",B00J2XAC0E,5.0,couldn't put it down,A2U04ZKWGH6YF6,"Fina Whitesage comes home unannounced from college to find her pack murdered. As she makes her way to safely after they attacked her she see a little boy waiting to go to school, she takes him with her and they seek a hiding place away from those who killed her pack.Sheriff Cutler Powell is the Alpha of a little place  where Fina and Ryan stop and little does she know the Alpha is her mate but so is his brother Nathaniel. Together they swear to keep Fina and Ryan safe from the rouge pack that slaughtered Fins's family and pack.This story was a great read because it showed the emotional side of the characters and what they go through the loss of their families. What the female character feels during her struggle to come to terms with what happened and finding her mates plus raising Ryan.This was a great read and because of some sexual content it is for mature paranormal readers. Action, drama, romance and love  are all in this book.I give this book 5 stars out of 5."
"03 19, 2014",B00J3BRW6C,4.0,Love me some Ryder!,A3BDLAPOIZXEBL,"After I finished Ryder, I was really excited to get my hands on Two Worlds Colliding. Both Jade and Ryder fascinated me and I felt like I needed more of these characters. Thankfully, Jani Kay definitely did not disappoint. Disclaimer &#8211; the book picks up right where Ryder left off, so you definitely HAVE to read that before reading this one.Oh Ryder! He&#8217;s so rugged and alpha and masculine! I never thought that I&#8217;d appreciate a man calling a woman a female dog (to keep the language clean), but somehow it really works for him. The language and structure that Kay utilizes just makes it come across as an endearing term, oddly enough. Jade was also a wonderful character. I loved the inner turmoil she faced with her own desires versus doing what her parents and brother expected of her. I&#8217;ll admit that I was initially annoyed by her in Ryder because of how judgmental she was, but there was a complete 180 in this one. I definitely appreciated her more!One of my favorite things about this book is that you could really see the transformation of both Jade and Ryder. Jade was struggling to grow and become her own independent woman, and Ryder was a part of the reason for that. On the same coin, Ryder was also transforming and changing because of the feelings he had for Jade. By the end of the book, neither character was the same as in the beginning.  The dual viewpoint really helped to serve this purpose. By seeing inside each character&#8217;s heads and knowing their thoughts, the reader was able to see the progression of their feelings. I was able to see just how much their priorities were changing.Overall, I really enjoyed this book. It was a modern day Romeo and Juliet &#8211; which I had thought to myself before it was mentioned in the book! I think the only thing I would have liked was to have more of the MC environment since it is a biker book. However, I understand that it&#8217;s a balance between what is necessary to the storyline and what isn&#8217;t. It didn&#8217;t end on a cliffhanger but there are definitely a lot more questions I want answers to! Now I am really looking forward to the release of Unchain My Heart in July!"
"03 27, 2014",B00J3IKORE,5.0,good read,A2PZ0J9M4Y5O8U,Same as rest of trilogy but probably half as long as I am used to from this author. Not a bad read but would prefer it if the books were being cranked out a little faster... No ones fault but I can still complain about it.
"03 21, 2014",B00J47H8H8,5.0,Still hooked!!,A1V69VCQHEVVFN,"Complimentary copy provided by author for an honest review.  I'm still hooked on this series. It keeps getting hotter and hotter. I still have no idea what will happen.  I can't wait to read book 5 so I can find out. But, I'm not sure I'm ready for the story to end.  I love reading about Jess and Dylan."
"04 17, 2014",B00J4S6YWC,3.0,Very Cute,A36NJCTXUVZR3L,This book was pretty cute. I enjoyed reading the second-chance romance that this book turned out to be. I loved the grandmother and all her scheming. The story was a pretty good one. I mean who would want to be stuck on a month cruise with the millionaire hunk who you though broke your heart? And never mind he thought she was a gold digger that had been cheating on him. Tons of miscommunications and then a whole lot earning their way back into each other&#8217;s hearts.
"03 22, 2014",B00J5IV97Q,5.0,Wow Wow Wow,A3DN56KCQTKIDM,"Round Two of Dom Wars was so much more then I thought it was going to be. This story most definitely as all the hot sex you need but so much more. As Lucian and Tara continued their journey in the games they became that much closer to one another. The past these two have has made it difficult to let go and believe in a glorious relationship.  Lucian Bane (the author) has done so many things with publishing this book.  Showing what true Dominance means to him will not only help me but anyone who reads this story.  Lucian just wants Tara to trust in him that he will not break her, I believe he has shown her through his actions thus far that  she can, I guess we will see. Another hot story Lucian and I thank you for sharing it with me. The way Lucian gives Tara whatever it is she needs at the moment is marvelous, a true gentleman in my opinion. Leaving his own wants and desires go to give her what she needs is selfless, and I hope more women and men alike take note.  Here's a piece from the book  God help me sweet Jesus I was losing my soul and mind. And body. He was slowly taking it all and making me into something something entirely different.  I will patiently await the next Round ;0)"
"04 28, 2014",B00J5IV97Q,4.0,Now the good stuff in the book,A3BR1CG9CRXB6Z,The author wrote this book with passion for each chapter of the story. The challenge for the characters and story line was written to perfection. At each challenge grew  Tara and Lucian closer to each other. The book was a beautiful story written by the author. I can't wait for the third book in this series.
"07 21, 2014",B00J5NRIIK,4.0,Short yet Sexy,A2XWNFCQ9U8N3S,"I just finished Touched by the Sandman and I really liked it. It's short, maybe took 30 mins to read but I enjoyed it. Aryne is a guide. His job was to bring sweet, peaceful dreams. His comes to Alainn to help her through her dreams. What he didn't expect was to want her so much.  But the problem is just he can only be with her in her dreams. Or can't he? You just have to read and see.This was short yet sweet and sexy. It had a good plot. An original plot that I had heard in awhile. Like how the author put her spin on the sandman story.

"04 5, 2014",B00J5ZGC7G,1.0,not good...,A39Q1Q7GF83OXJ,"The writing was awkward, the characters were under developed...even for a novella.  There wasn't anything particularly endearing about Bentley, especially considering he was a bully in high school.  Impossible for me to get into the story."

"05 28, 2014",B00J88I8JA,4.0,Entertaining Old-School Horror,A21FGA1Z7PI4YA,"Kristopher Rufty has written a gem of an old-school horror novel that contains everything a fervent fan of the genre craves: compelling characters, violence, sex, monsters, and a traveling show of carnal desires that destroys everything in its path. At times Richard Laymon-esque and at others reminiscent of '80s B-movie horror, THE SKIN SHOW delivers its grotesquery in an entertaining and chilling horror romp."

Beau decides to convince her he is worth loving and she is worth being loved.  He asks her for one month, and during that month you see how charming our 'Sweet Renegade' can be.  Andria Large did a great job telling us a story of two people who are falling in love but one who is to stubborn to see the end result based on a past that she couldn't control.&#34;That's the problem Lizzie, I don't hate you, and believe me, I've tried.

"05 12, 2014",B00JD17QKY,5.0,A new dystopia that will make you love the protagonists and their adventure filled with secrets!,A3BYF51FUTTRQN,"Actual Rating: 4.5/5&#34;Secrets and water have one thing in common:they get distorted on the surface.&#34;I have recently found this book and I was at first allured by its mysterious cover and by the synopsis. I usually do not tend to read e-books since I do not own a suited e-reader but I really wanted to give this book a go since it was not that big and it sounded really good.After reading a few pages I was really wondering what the book was about and I somehow dived in the story without even realising how the pages were flowing beneath my eyes. I was captured by the plot and by the characters of the book.The chapters alternated between the female protagonist, Pym, and the male protagonist, Rush. I really like books that have two characters who show their own side of the story, informing the reader with more things that help him understand the things that they are supposed to overcome as the story evolves.I really liked this book since it brought something new to me. The secrets that are held at Aqua, a floating city, make the reader curious and more curious. The dark secrets that revealed in front of my eyes made my jaw drop since when I began reading &#34;The Aqua Secret&#34; I had no idea of what the big secret would actually be.The main characters, Pym and Rush, who have been friends since they were young, were to my liking. As time had passed they started to have another view of one another but their fear of ruining a friendship does not let them take a step further. Their bond is strong and they always are there for one another despite their rare arguments.When I found out that most of those who remained alive (after the world had been consumed by water) got the ability to keep their breath under water for a longer time than normal humans can, I started to wonder how that was possible. Rush had been capable to stay under water for a longer period comparted to others of his kind and, when he realised that something with him was starting to change...he wanted to keep it a secret, even from Pym. Secrets among secrets, lies among lies. Pym is scared when she finds out an unbelievable truth that she did not want to acknowledge.This book was a combination of romance, secrets, fear and betrayal, a dystopia which kept me reading and reading, hoping for the characters to confess their love and survive the dark secrets that are bound to make the next generations something that could be considered unearthly...I did not give the book a full 5 stars since there is room for improvement but I want to say that it is a really catchy read! I am curious if the next book will be more awesome! I am really curious what is going to happen next and I have big expectations!Quotes:&#34;I looked around and could see nothing but ocean. There was no land in sight. There were others floating on pieces of steel just like my family and me... but where we were floating to - I did not know.&#34;&#34;I would often lay in bed at night and dream that Rush and I were swimming to another community and that they would befriend us and show us their ways. But I knew this was only a dream.&#34;&#34;God, she was so damn beautiful, and I tried with all my might and all control not to walk over there and steal her oxygen by kissing her. Did she have to stare at me as if she wanted to do the same?&#34;&#34;Looking up at the surface of the water, the sun's rays were bright so I could see his face clearly. He swam toward me and put his hand on my waist. I smiled at him to thank him for coming with me, and he nodded.&#34;&#34; &#8220;That's exactly right, my dear girl.&#8221; I clenched my teeth to stop my jaw from popping open in shock. &#8220;You and your little boyfriend are what I call the future. You are the Adam and Eve, and who are going to give birth to a new race, a brand new species.&#8221; &#34;"
"05 20, 2014",B00JDLFHRI,5.0,Gypsy Brothers Series is a MUST Read!,A1MMRTP2C2XF1G,"This series contains everything in one love, drugs, violence, passion, motorcycles, revenge, sex (unwanted as well) and just straight up drama all around. The main character is seeking revenge on a leader of a MC and his sons for raping her when she was younger and killing her father. She suffered a LOT and this series is not for the faint of heart. Highly recommend but does contain material not suited for all so beware."
"07 13, 2014",B00JDOWAN4,5.0,A compelling read!,A1ZHB20774AVOX,"I have read all the books in this series, and they just keep getting better and better. In this novel, we find out quite a lot more about the pasts of both Romney and Marsh, who for different reasons, have a number of dark secrets from their pasts. The book provides an effective balance between a compelling murder mystery and engagement with interesting, complex characters. The Dover setting in the series is a character in its own right, and like Romney and Marsh, with each book, we discover its positives and negatives. Although it seems to be a common convention in British detective writing to have a pair who work together, it is to Tidy's credit that he avoids the stereotyped relationship we see in so many of these novels. This is not a predictable or comfortable relationship, but factors that create the loyalty that makes Romney and Marsh an effective team are fascinating in their own right.I look forward to reading the next book in the series."

And then there is this!!Cold Comfort is the second in Lee Brazils In From The Cold Series and is it a doosie&#8230;.Lee Brazil you have brought to this story a wonderful new character in Finn Lorensson,  you call wanabee Prince Charming. Finn has his sights set on the new guy in town Dr Cannon Malloy. Cannon is the good doctor who was Chance&#8217;s lover, and who couldn&#8217;t quite come out of the closet, destroying his marriage and the love of his life in Pulp Friction 2013.

Cannon is still skittish and he is being romanced very slowly with wine, flowers and candlelight as Phinn has decided Cannon is what he wants and makes it his goal to court, tease, and win the golden ring. They are both at the lust stage and Phinn is ready to seal the deal bringing Canon a long stem rose and a blatant invitation to dinner and bed.We who know Cannon, know the baggage he is faced with; how will he react and how will he share that part of himself that he left behind. Lee Brazil has written a wonderful second novella for this series. We feel the yearning, the heat and finally the explosion of their joining. It all was so beautiful, and then thank you very much Lee Brazil (not), we get to see what happens when Cannon comes face to face with a gun being pointed at Finn.. This might not be what Finn is expecting; the gun being pointed at him or the reaction of Cannon! OMG will the next story just get here fast?????

"04 28, 2014",B00JL4UL3C,4.0,Hoboken Really,A38UD5KTVMW1LS,"It was a quick read, but I enjoyed every minute of it.  I laughed a lot  and enjoyed the characters."
"04 22, 2014",B00JMORVM0,4.0,4.5 out of 5 Stars,A2O4Z88GVCITJY,"Dr. Traci Tanner is a successful intern in an LA hospital - part of why she is so successful is due to the fact that she has Asperger's syndrome - in short this means that she is a great problem solver, but not so much of a people person.Dr. Conrad Brady is not so much of a successful doctor given the fact that for the life of him, he is not able to act like a serious person. To top that, he's also a serious manwhore with a reputation that's all over the hospital. And the rumor says that Dr. Brady never re-visits his &#34;patients&#34; twice.As the rational human being Dr. Tanner is, she sees Dr. Brady as the perfect person to brush up on her &#34;people&#34; skills. That is until the two of them are put into competition for a prestigious career opportunity...Say Anything is the sequel to Wake For Me (Sam and Viola&#8217;s story), and now tells Sam&#8217;s best friend Brady&#8217;s story. When I read Wake For Me, Brady came across as a jerk - but the lovely kind - that just doesn&#8217;t know when to stop joking and start acting serious, and when I heard that Say Anything would deal about him and put him into competition with a much more competent (female) doctor, I was eager as anything to get my hands on this book.And I was not disappointed! This book starts off as an innocent hate/love office romance, except it&#8217;s not your usual office setting, but a hospital. Say Anything also holds a semblant to The Do-Over or Unintentional Virgin : (view spoiler) In other words, this is fun guaranteed over the first 50% percent of the book.After the 50% mark, the &#8220;thriller&#8221; part kicks in, where something very unexpected kicks in, and the happy banter is replaced by a more serious tone. I won&#8217;t spoil anything here, because this book is really worth reading.The reason why I gave this book only 4 Stars is because I was disappointed that things turned out to be solved so quickly. I would have loved to learn more about Brady and Tanner and their respective lives before Say Anything and during. Some details could have easily been &#8220;more detailed&#8221;, and the story of their relationship could have been expanded (especially in order to have more of those great steamy scenes). I just found that once the main intrigue was resolved, the book unfortunately ended for too quickly for my taste.But this book was nevertheless a really great read and even though he&#8217;s a jerk sometimes, you will come to loooove Dr. Brady just as much as you came to love Dr. Philips in Wake For Me. Isobel Irons has a great way with words (kudos for the 3rd person alternated POV that is so well written) and she definitely knows how to make her characters loveable despite their flaws.I can&#8217;t wait for the next book in the series!"
"04 30, 2014",B00JMU2ZB6,5.0,Very good,AI2HY1YC9RUD1,"This seems to be a hot topic as of late. Although most of this book is about managing stress, you'll find it goes from the basics of emotional intelligence to specifics. When you control your behavior, you can control a lot else. I liked the part about emotional intelligence in professional life and being approachable as a leader. You'll certainly be more aware of verbal and nonverbal cues after reading. Highly recommended!"
"05 7, 2014",B00JNKAPAI,1.0,"Packed: Turned - It was free. All I wasted was the time; thankfully, I'm a very fast reader.",AQW0DI8M0W9LC,"So very happy this was free! Illiterate, even if some it was meant to be in dialect.  You can't tell for sure, so no points there. No suspense. Shallow, stilted characters except the heroine, who could be interesting if there were more to the rest of the cast. The description of the locale is good and the opening is also compelling. I was so disappointed after the first few pages. Maybe it gets better in later installments, but I am not risking any money to find out."
"06 22, 2014",B00JO1Q4EC,5.0,Awesome Excellant Series,A1AGF4W7FQ1PTL,"Well Wendi has left me hanging again.  Loved the book but the ending....dang it..... Ok now for the review. I loved the 1st and we were left hanging with Kylie life in danger. I not giving you a spoiler she survives, because had she not we would not have a book. after the crash we see Kylie trying to get her life back on track, the poor girl has had some crap in her life but she just keeps bouncing back, Cameron is still just the sweetest guy, in this book we see him take their sexual relationship to a whole new level, lots of heat in this book. I cannot wait until book 3 Everlasting Love to come out. This is a cliffhanger book just like Book 1, normally I do not like to read cliffhanger type of books but I do not regret reading this series.  This is a great buy and don't forget to get book 1 as the story is a great read but you do not need to buy that book in order to understand the storyline.

"04 29, 2014",B00JQCLLQ0,5.0,Preparation Meets Confidence,AZK9NAQHMNYNX,"You know how those who exude confidence seem to have so many opportunities flock to them? Too many people have no clue what they're doing when they go into an interview, and they end up going to one after another after another facing constant rejection. They might prepare a little for interviews, but they're mainly just planning to wing it and hope not to appear too nervous and jittery. But preparation garners confidence and confidence in an interview not only eliminates the jitters, it just might cut down on the number of interviews you have to go through since you'll be so impressive they may choose you as their choice on the spot (even if they don't tell you right then and continue interviewing others).And that's where a guide like this one steps in to help. You'll come across gems like how to doing research on the company AND industry. Among other things, it helps you formulate questions to ask if/when they inevitably ask if you have any questions. (I always felt a bit awkward at that part). And I never would have thought of taking some of that research along with me to the interview! I also liked how the author mentioned the different types of interviews you may encounter. It's the one thing about interviewing that made me the most nervous!The idea of preparation may seem daunting at first, but the author lays things out in clear, step-by-step detail that's easy (and even a little fun) to follow, and it also includes action steps at the end of each chapter to help you get prepared."
"07 13, 2014",B00JQPRRJ2,3.0,"Strong beginning, predictable ending",A1KYJA5YM1479G,"Hello yummy bear shifter!!! My weakness, sigh.The beginning of this book started off really strong. I like the characters and the build. Paris is a touch &#34;woe is me&#34; and has weight issues. She has times when she over comes, it just gets old quick. I understand she has been dealt a bad hand,I just expected more change in her when she found her strength.Wes is a perfectly grumpy grizzly! Yes, I will have a double serving of that please!!! He does have a quick moment where you might not like him. Thankfully he does not go so far that it turned me off him.The smexy is all kids of hot and heavy. Kind of much in the typical virgin to nympho type. But it is an erotic romance, and that fits the pattern.The overall story has plenty of arcs and peaks. Lots of things are super obvious and predictable. Still it was an enjoyable read and I am curious to see more of this author's yummy bears!"
"06 26, 2014",B00JR9YKBU,4.0,A delightful debut novel!,A1FV4HR2LATAH0,"Her Cowboy Casanova is a delightful debut novel. The story is a wonderful mix of new places, love, fun, and cowboys! It is a perfect summery read to enjoy by the pool- or on a porch swing! HCC is a quick read, but the author sure knows how to write a love story. One of my favorite things about Her Cowboy Casanova is the fact that the main female character did not fall head over heels for Dylan the instant she laid eyes on him. Their relationship progressed at a good pace and made the romance really shine later in the book. The end sets up nicely for the next book in the series, which I am really looking forward to reading!"

"05 13, 2014",B00JSK59CW,4.0,Interesting book,A2QAQCD3BFG2JN,"As Bill points out at the beginning of this book,procrastination is nothing new as it was mentioned in the Bible.He takes us nicely through the ages to Benjamin Franklin.There are some real surprises in the book including the surprisingly high number of people who suffer from procrastination.Even if you consider yourself decisive,you may realise from this book that there are areas where you do procrastinate."
"05 3, 2014",B00JSUHGA0,5.0,An Excellent Book on Goal Setting,A1U5XB6PCIDLIK,"I have read a lot of books on this subject and some are good, and others, not so much. However, this one is an exception to the rule. The funny thing about new-age is it isn't really new age, most of these concepts have been around forever, even something like learning about achieving your goals. While most of the books out there are very similar in conveying tihs message, it is always refreshing to see the message delivered in a style that captures my attention which the author did from the get-go with this book.From the beginning of the book, Rachel Robins states,&#34;If you&#8217;ve struggled to achieve your goals in the past, there&#8217;s a reason:Desire is not strong enoughLacking real motivationTime constraintsPoor organizational skillsGoal wasn&#8217;t realisticProcrastination issuesProblems focusing&#34;I appreciate the no-nonsense approach in letting me know from the start what the probable issues are, which is half of the battle. I know it's just common sense, but in the words of Benjamin Franklin, &#34;The thing about common sense is that it is not all that common.&#8221; Yes, there isn't a one-size-fits-all in this world but the way Rachel Robins presents her thoughts in a clear and precise way, well, it just resonated with me, a simple matter-of-fact manner that I was able to connect with. It doesn't matter what your desired outcome is or in what area of your life you want to change or what goal you wish to achieve, this book offers several techniques designed in getting you there.Another aspect I liked was all the quotes from leaders in their respected fields that share their thoughts on what it took, especially the quote from Michael Jordan, &#34;I&#8217;ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.&#8221; Borrowing from the experts like Zig Ziglar, Earl Nightingale, Tony Robbins, Peter Drucker, and many more, even a Jersey boy, Jon Bon Jovi, Rachel Robins has assembled some remarkable methods worthy of consideration from even the most educated of those in the arena of &#34;Goal Setting.&#34; The &#34;quick tips&#34; throughout the book are a nice little bonus too, and the mixture of text and fonts kept me alert, well done.I am not going to give away all the knowledge here in a review but to illustrate the message and what it meant to me I would use this analogy, &#34;It isn't how many times you get knocked down that matters. It's how many times you get back up.&#34; And like the quote I use for the title of this review from Yogi Berra, this book does give the reader a road map to attaining whatever it is that you desire.If I had to recommend just one book on goal setting, one that I believe gives the reader the best shot at getting the results they want, and offers the easiest methods with clarity, then this would be the book. I am very impressed and feel lucky to have run across this book, Rachel Robins has advance my education tremendously, Thank You ma'am for taking me to school,"

"04 26, 2014",B00JUENQN0,5.0,LOVED IT!!!,A2XWNFCQ9U8N3S,"I just finished Point of Return and I really liked it. Its a biker book so of course I was willing to give it a try and damn am I glad that I got to read it. It is on of those ones that you know is gonna be gritty and dirty but that is what makes it good. Olivia has had some hardships. She is the daughter to Bull, Bull is the president of the Nordiac Lords MC. She ran away a few years ago, has bit of a grudge. Who can blame her. Almost getting killed and then when she is saved feels like she had to handle that all on her own. Deciding to come back she hooks up with Travis. Sources say he is a bad cop but no one knows for sure. All Olivia knows is that she is with him not only because they were friends growing up but she doesn't want to be alone. Not wanting to do with the club she tends to stick to herself. What she didn't count on was Daemon, Vice President to the Nordiac Lords MC. He was her first everything. First love, friend, lover, and heartache. Will she be able to forgive Daemon for the wrongs committed to her by him? What will happen if the club finds out that Travis is a dirty cop when all they were trying to do was protect the town and their own? You will have to read and see....Daemon, Daemon, Daemon. What a sexy beast. He is everything you could ask for in this story. Biker, sexy, and dirty but what makes him better for me is that he is loyal. His interaction towards Olivia is sad, yet understanding but she knows the life and has to either except it or leave. Olivia is a good girl at heart but she does have to make a decision. What she sees and hears in this story shouldn't surprise her. She has grown up in this lifestyle but at the end of the day you do feel bad for her. Things happen that shouldn't, they had to but you just want her to be able to be happy. I can say that the chemistry between Daemon and Olivia is on fire. It is sexy and hot and man does it just scorch the page. You want nothing more then for them to be together but I have to tell you, it is gonna be hard for them.Overall this was a very good story. Like I said at the beginning and have been saying.....I'm a biker girl. I love everything about the biker story. The characters, the plots, how gritty and real they are. It truly tends to make an enjoyable read. This has all you could ask for. What makes it for me is the characters. Even though there is many, they are original and trust me, you will want to stick with this story because there is still more to come. Jaden, Jules, Finn, Ryker, and Faith. All I can say is bring on all the drama cause I'm a waiting!Story 5Smut 5Overall 5Reviewed by Beggin from Mommys A Book Whore"
"06 30, 2014",B00JVV3WJ0,3.0,Love Ms. Holt but was a little disappointed.,A2VMZX8CVJNBCF,"I've read the first two books in this series...I will buy and read last one as well. However, I realized that the sex scenes in BOTH books is almost exactly the same. The only difference between book one and two in the first actual sex scene are the character's names. Even the dialogue of what they say in the sex scene and how it is done is the same. What happened Cheryl?? Did you copy and paste the sex scenes?"
"07 9, 2014",B00JVV3WJ0,5.0,Fun read,ADM3NLCG1HJNN,As with all of Cheryl Holt's romances this one is excellent! She is very good at developing characters and keeping you totally involved in the story. Love her books.
"07 11, 2014",B00JW3O2GY,5.0,Yet Another Fabulous Book From Stephanie Rowe,A191X4QWRON47B,Stephanie Rowe writes great romance (paranormal and contemporary). GHOST is no exception.  Her characters are real people with real emotions and issues.  The story is completely believable and full of excitement and tension!  I loved this book from page one and have read it at least three times. I wanted to go find my hunk in the wilds of Alaska after reading this story.
"06 24, 2014",B00JXS3SHC,5.0,The Best So Far!!,A1VQI3XMPNIL8S,"If you've ever wondered how it all went down, how Donna became our Donna, then wonder no more! This book gives great background and insight to all the characters we've followed and either loved or loved to hate. It was great to see this view of Jack. IAs always, I can't wait to see what's next! Josie Brown is amazing! Keep writing and I'll keep reading."
"05 5, 2014",B00JYEQOYO,5.0,Really nice story,A3EQCMB6RCATYC,The story was a really nice one to read. The plot offered a lot of excitement and surprising twists. The thing I like the most about Antioche Adventures is that reading this story made me completely immerse myself into reading.Can't wait for book two.
"05 27, 2014",B00JYEQYIA,1.0,Disappointing/ inconsistent,A2W1XCZXCLLSMK,"Sadie is the main character who has lived a life of desperation.  Then by a chance meeting she is given a new beginning.  The title tells the reader the story line.  Sadie marries a kind and handsome young man with a baby.  Allen is too good to be true, in fact he seems flawless.  Most of this story centers on the intimacies between Sadie and Allen.  There is very explicit sexual encounters, much more so than your average romance novel.  I rated this story one star because to this reader about half the story just didn't make sense based on each character in the story. It is difficult to rate this book adequately without giving specifics.  I deleted the book from library."
"06 27, 2014",B00JZ7G8I2,4.0,Fast paced thrill,AJI1IQ11D5V3X,"Great pacing and a well written plot anchor this dystopian thriller. Anyone who is a lover of action, survival stories or thrillers will instantly enjoy this book! Cannot wait to start the next one!"
"07 6, 2014",B00K1GXOHY,3.0,Ok,A2L7C3O50SB8BD,"This author needs to fire her editor! Too many spelling and grammatical errors. The storyline was a good one but took too long to build. I am seriously getting tired of being forced to buy more books to see how a story ends! If your books are good I will buy them, spot with the series nonsense!!!!"
"05 8, 2014",B00K1S1QQI,5.0,This book has everything.,A3PO2LJ13D5GIE,"This book really does have everything. It is Sci-fi, cyberpunk, political thriller, mystery, and action adventure story all rolled up into one large tapestry. The action is fast and intense, the plot is engaging and easy to follow, and the characters are fully fleshed out and believable. The story is told from multiple points of view but instead of wanting to hurry through certain chapters to get back to other characters the authors are able to make you feel invested in all the characters and to feel as if you will miss out on something if you breeze through any part if the story. The authors also strike a fine balance of revealing information and keeping you guessing on the major mysteries of the book. The other thing that makes this series enjoyable is how the authors tie in other Beam universe stories, ie. The Future of Sex and the Sterling Gibson books. They make so that you don't have to read these other books but if you do the over all picture of this world becomes clearer and more intricate. The Beam is a more mature story, there is violence and bad words along with some sexual situations, but nothing is gratuitous. Lastly the Beam is a series of which this is part two, cliffhangers do occur, so be warned.  Overall this has been one of my favorite books so far this year and I can't wait for more to come out in this wonderful series and universe."
"05 17, 2014",B00K23LPZO,5.0,Wow,A2FSKWRVPF80VP,Wow I thought that the first two books in this series was good this one has them beat. Courtney Pierce life is a living nightmare with loving the girl that grew up with his hole life then with out of know where he falls for rachel. This book has a lot of twist and turns that it will keep you guessing at every chapter . I would recommend this book cant wait for the next one in the series
"07 14, 2014",B00K395P12,4.0,"Hot and passionate, sweet and sexy",A320QB8QO0OTPT,"3.5 starsHot and passionate, sweet and sexy all rolled into one. This novella is the beginning of Dex and Alica's story and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I don't normally go for serials because they usually feel rushed and cut off, but not Unrequited. Even though this was a short, quick read, I thought the pace of the story was great and the ending set us up nicely for the next instalment, a perfect tease for what is to come.I found both characters engaging and I could feel the chemistry between Alicia and Dex, intense with anticipation and hungry with need, Dex with his sex dirty mouth and Alicia with her blossoming sensuality. Alicia and Dex are drawn to each other, needing to let go of their past, feeling a connection to each other that they have never felt before. Both characters have their own fears they are facing and I am really looking forward to how this will play out, each learning to trust each other with the parts of themselves they have kept hidden.Even though this is a spin off from the Beachwood Bay series, I didn't feel confused, but I will be going back to read the whole series to meet the rest of the group as this novella has piqued my curiosity about the other books this author has written."

In this book a background information is presented so that you can understand exactly how your body will respond to natural aging process and poor lifestyle choices. I learned which lifestyle choices can accelerate the process of aging hundred times. I loved information about effects of moisturizer on skin in chpaters 4 & 5 as I really couldn't find it anywhere else. I liked that key facts are highlighted in red which makes the book very easy to read. Overall excellently written books and a lot of very valuable tips for staying young longer.

You know when you read a book and can't form coherent thoughts after you finish?... This. I finished and just sort of stared at the final page waiting for it to load more because I simply wasn't finished. Thank goodness there is a continuation or I might have to cry! Superheroes, sexiness, sassy dialogue, SCIENCE, geekery, and general incredibleness are within these pages. I highly recommend it and am waiting (super impatiently) for book 3."
"05 7, 2014",B00K5YWCIE,5.0,A perfect recipe for a great book!,A39KGQ8GCJGVAG,"The perfect combination of mystery, paranormal and romance, not to mention the foodie aspect! Yes I love foodie books (books that have some sort of food somewhere at their center)! A bakery owned by a witch who's father has some big meanie's after him...what's not to like?Dru sort of just falls into Rebecca's life and it is definitely a great match. They are able to help each other in so many ways and the chemistry between them is fantastic. I love the sound of the recipes and confections that Rebecca cooks up in the bakery, all of them made me hungry! Some of the parts where Dru was searching for his sister kept me on the edge of my seat while at other times I found myself laughing out loud.This was the best combination of some of my favorite things in paranormal romance. Add to that, that Dru is a cowboy and I was all set! Ashlyn Chase has outdone herself with this one, and the cover is just perfect. I love the drawn covers like this one, it really fits the story!I would definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for a story that will keep you interested, make you smile and at the same time have you wondering &#34;what happened&#34;.**I received this book for review but that has in no way effected my opinion.**"

CD Reiss is an impeccable writer, her stories are perfectly written and leave you wanting more!  Fiona is one big hot mess of a girl, but, there is still something redeeming about her.  For all that she has done and will continue to do, you want the best for her.  Add all the other characters that come to life in this book, and it is one amazing story.

"07 10, 2014",B00K9OOEH2,5.0,A great romance from an unique time period.,A3I4EQ1A96IBG8,"This book is from a unique time period (unique to me at least - I've never read a romance from this time period).  A time where prohibition is in effect and speakeasies are underground. Jessie (Red Phoenix) is a butcher trying to save her butcher shop (and pay debts) she inherited from her dad by day and is the Red Phoenix, speakeasy owner by night.  But it's not easy burning the candle at both ends.  She has to stay 2 steps ahead of the feds who are trying to catch the speakeasy in the act.In walks Tony, a has been cop turned private eye.  Tony is given an opportunity he can not refuse.  He wants to get back to police work that he was unjustly released from and thanks to Jamerson, he has another chance.  What he doesn't bank on is falling for the beautiful and talented Jessie.It's a game of cat and mouse.  Jessie suspects Tony is not on the up and up and Tony is fighting his attraction to who he assumes is The Phoenix's Girl.  Who will win the game???  I recommend you buy the book and find out.This is a great read that I really enjoyed.  The story line was great and the dialogue was believable.  The descriptions to details were spot on and easy to visualize.  I loved how this book was a mutli pov (my favorite kind). There was so much depth to the characters, even the side characters, that makes you become invested into the story.  I couldn't get enough and had a hard time putting it down.  About half way through it put me on an emotional roller coaster ride.  It hard heartache, triumph, sadness, joy, anguish and most of all love.Would I recommend this book:  Most Definitely!Would I read more from this author:  Absolutely!"

Let's just say that the only real blood brother is Conner who you will fall in love with and best friends Jarrett and Rhett. Both Jarrett and Rhett are brothers who Lizzie grew up with and play in the band where Lizzie sings called ""See You Next Tuesday"" and have remained by Lizzie's side through thick and thin. These two awesome men have been with Liz through it all and never a doubt that they are one for all, all for one.Ok so you get the picture of Jarrett and Rhett great guys, great friends etc. Enter Cannon Blackwell who Lizzie meets while on a rest stop that his ex girlfriend leaves him at. Immediately Lizzie see's a guitar in his procession, just what she is looking for another band member and bang! Could luck get any better and yes there are sparks my friends, and Cannon is just the recipe that Lizzie needs to make her swoon. He is a dash of trustworthy, a twist of smartness, a whole cup of handsomeness, and a pinch of...well you just want to pinch him for yourself (oh come on you know you do I will guarantee you!)What is so surprising about Cannon is just his way about himself, how he is able to take the pain from Lizzie and with his famous ""one in for you, one out for me"" breathing technique helps Lizzie deal with all the pain and suffering she has had in the past. While both Jarrett and Rhett come to accept Cannon for what he is, they both know that this is real thing for Lizzie and want her to have the happiness that she so deserves.There are other two other important characters in this book one Lizzie and Conner's father Richard who Lizzie has fought with for years regarding her ""bubs""Conner and her Uncle Bruce who has always had his niece and nephew's back at all times.Yes, this book has everything and more that you could want in a fabulous story, and be prepared to have the tissues ready cause I cannot hide the fact that there will be times that you want to cry."

The fact that the proceeds from the sale go to a charity was another plus. Ashley's short story, Sapphire was a must read in the Moments In Time collection.  I loved it, Ashley always has a way of drawing me into the story and I can't wait to read more about Sapphire!But the more stories I read the more I realized this was the perfect collection for me. It includes some great authors and stories, but it also gives someone like me, who usually sticks to one genre, a chance to branch out. The collection includes historical, contemporary, paranormal, fantasy and steam-punk stories. To be honest the last three I listed have never held an appeal to me. But this collection is the perfect way to ""test the waters""."

I will say this: the character growth between Kelvin and Lily can be seen throughout the entire book and I love how they are stronger than ever. I loved Lily's commitment to Kelvin, no matter what was going on, even when introduced to Senior, she held her own.Senior...you will have to experience him for yourself.

This book is one that is much needed for me right now as I have quite a bit of weight to lose and really need to accomplish it very soon. I'm going to try some of the advice that Missy Patterson gives in this book and see how well it will work for me in my own journey to losing weight, keeping it off, and starting a whole new healthy and happy life. I don't think that losing weight will make me a happier person, but I believe the health benefits of being smaller will help me begin on a track of bringing myself up and feeling much better.

"06 26, 2014",B00KP86B0K,4.0,Dream Huntress Review,ASVY5XSYJ1XOE,"This psychic suspense is a riveting romance that keeps readers shivering in anticipation.  Hiding her gift, Detective Jordan Delaney is undercover as a cocktail waitress. Playing the part of a fallen cop, Tyler McGee lands the job of head bouncer at a corrupt local club.  Fighting their attraction to each other could kill them, but giving in might prove to be even deadlier.This steady to fast paced and smooth flowing plot keeps readers on their toes with action, suspense, drama and romance.  The author describes the story with well written scenes and details that capture the imagination and the well orchestrated suspense and action scenes arouse curiosity and draw the reader deeper into the story.  The characters are strong, compelling, easily related to and grab the reader&#8217;s attention from the very beginning.The attraction between Tyler and Jordan explodes from the pages with red hot passion and the sex scenes are even hotter, but it is the relationship that has fireworks exploding everywhere.  Believing they know best, each tries to protect the other which causes some explosive arguments between these two stubborn characters and the reader can&#8217;t help but get caught up in the drama and excitement of their stories and the case they are working on.I was a slightly disappointed in the beginning of the story because Jordan&#8217;s gift wasn&#8217;t really prominent, but at the same time aroused the curiosity about exactly what her gift and how it worked to an extreme high.  The reader can&#8217;t help but empathize with her past and the terror and pain of her nightmares and they can certainly understand why she hides them. Tyler screws some things up, but that&#8217;s a man for you, the reader can&#8217;t help but agree that he is perfect for Jordan.Overall, I found the story to enjoyable and entertaining and the author provided plenty of surprising twists to keep me on my toes and I liked the conclusion of the story, although the closure given to Jordan&#8217;s past trauma was a little anti-climatic, it did make a lot of sense."

I enjoyed the links included that gives recipes for natural toothpaste and other helpful recipes. This is a great book for new mothers as well as every human being on the planet. A great reference book. Well worth the price.
"06 7, 2014",B00KQX5DVC,3.0,Not Up To Par For Me,AH2N0TAXLZPNB,I adore all of Jet Mykles books but I was disappointed with this book. SPOILERS MAY BE AHEAD:It was like the entire book was Lance feeling bad for cheating on Gordon back when they were boyfriends.  I felt that Lance's guilt was way out of proportion to what happened.  The entire book you are made to think Gordon was the total innocent part and he was completely unwilling to give Lance a second chance.  Near the end of the book you find out Gordon was at least partly responsible for what happened.  I felt Gordon was way to controlling and Lance could do better.  The whole relationship was just to one sided.

But sometimes things work out and they blossom from it.This story is so amazing and shows that love will be there even when you think it is not possible."
"07 1, 2014",B00KSNT3IE,3.0,Nothing new here.,A2S9JHHZZ2MSLS,These books are good for a quick read but be aware the characters in ALL her books are the same. The males all have the same &#34;needs&#34; as well as the female against the relationship until the end. Very one dimensional and why do all the female leads say &#34;um&#34; over and over? Seriously the dialogue is getting pretty old but hey if you got nothing else to read then give it a go.
"07 7, 2014",B00KTKHZW2,5.0,A good check on your metabolism.,A1KQZCO1PNA807,I'm glad I came across this book as it has helped me understand things about my body I didn't appreciate may be telling me I have a low metabolism. Don't count on your doctor always knowing! Overall gave me a good idea of what to look for in the way your body works I hadn't really considered before. Also an interesting chapter &#34;Clean Up Your System&#34; I found informative about fluoride and bromide.

Jack &#8216;The Viking&#8217; is a complicated bad boy and the last thing he wants is a relationship.  Everything changes when he meets Janet.  There&#8217;s a lot of passion and romance packed into this little book.  Once I started I didn&#8217;t put it down until I finished.  Can&#8217;t wait for next Hot Blooded Hero!
"07 9, 2014",B00KUB5K4U,5.0,Secrets Revealed,A3MQBVYW0APY5A,"I've become more interested in WWII history over the last few months and I've purchased several books. This book covers many of the the secrets and conspiracy theories on WWII & Nazi Germany. I appreciate learning something new - this book covers old, well-known topics while adding to information that is rarely covered like Hitler's personal life and Nazi weapons programs. I actually learned something after reading this book. Ryan Jenkins doesn't bury the lead, he balances being informative with a concise structure.Worth Checking out"

Though their conversations do not always make sense.  This is a departure from the formula of the series previously.  This book has Darcy solving the murder on her own, no sister, no Smudge the cat, no Jon.These are well written and they are short, averaging a little over 70 pages.  This one includes a short story featuring smudge the cat.While I enjoyed this one I hope she goes back to including more of the supporting characters.In short these are short clean mysteries with a paranormal twist.  They are best read in order."

Without letting the lines get blurry.When Semya gets to Toronto she realizes this case is going to be a lot harder to solve then she ever imagined it was going to be. Polli & Semya figure out is was retaliation from 5yrs earlier. The worst part Polli's brothers and Josh were ALL involved!! Yea, it's THAT bad!!In 'Bird of Prey' we know that everything we know about Josh was not 100% true. Semya knew that as well. But, she never pushed him. Now, she will find out EVERYTHING!!! That alone is a huge bomb for both Semya & Polli. If that wasn't bad enough. They learn about Polli's family & what trouble they have caused in the past.Semya & Polli are still up to their old antics. These two are awesome together. They understand each other.

All the drama, scary moments, along with hot sex/BDSM, spicy roomance were lovingly capped off by a wonderful HFN (maybe a HEA?), although I really want to see more with Rand, Wyatt, and Jenny's family. As always, I loved how Patricia utilized couples from her other books to have some great sex scenes without compromising the timing of the Rand, Wyatt, and Jenny's budding relationships. I especially enjoyed Master Rand's first assignment for Wyatt and Jenny.The scenes they described and their emotions as they watched gave me tons of &#34;aw&#34; moments as a lifestyle submissive. I admit, as Patricia Logan fangirl, I do ponder if &#34;book 4&#34; means we're closer to the end of this series than I hope."

This book can help you with basic repairs such as a leaky faucet or clogged toilet, and can also help you to make your home more energy efficient. I have a teenage son, and as we do repairs, I teach him so that he can do these things for himself in the future. This book is great for helping to teach him the basics of home repair.

"07 13, 2014",B00L0ITV2Y,2.0,This left me depressed and uncomfortable.,A1WVORERMA7G18,"Only Milan's exceptional writing skill could have accomplished this.While the initial &#34;gift&#34; required my disbelief to be put out to pasture, I was okay with that.  The circumstances of that &#34;gift&#34; were too repellant to me, however.  It just stretched my credulity too far to see &#34;love&#34; when there had only been a few perfunctory words exchanged over the course of three years.I could have moved on from there but the wretched poverty, the lower middle class living on the thin edge of desperation, grasping at the tiniest shred of hope while sometimes living in fear of their &#34;betters,&#34;.....this was so pervasive throughout the story that it just beat me down.  The little bits of joy that appeared simply couldn't turn the grim tide for me.I admire Milan's superb mastery of this seldom told story of the era.  It was that superior depiction, I think, that finally did me in.  I felt too much."
"06 19, 2014",B00L1XT5V0,5.0,This fan can't wait to get her hands on your next book!,AX2VYUIZGH6V4,"It was with a heavy heart that I opened the book of Lexi.  Reading the final installment of this story is like saying ""Goodbye"" to a dear friend.  Lexi, the book, is a prequel to A Twist Of Fate.Lexi starts off with a bang. The big break-up scene that is the catalyst for Lexi to become the ball-busting outspoken take charge woman that she is.  Broken and full of loathing for the person she had become, Lexi pulls herself up and figuratively washes away the remnants of her existence until all that is left is a core of steel.Needing a change of scenery, Lexi goes to Rome with a few dollars in her pocket and her worldly belongings in suitcases.  She waits tables in an Italian restaurant with her flatmate and friend Stefania.  Being flatmates works out very well for them both - Stefania taught Lexi how to speak italian and Lexi is teaching her english.  Both Stefania and Lexi are outrageous flirts and enjoy clubbing together.  Stefania falls in and out of love like most people change their pants.  Lexi doesn't allow herself to fall in love; she doesn't want attachments; doesn't want strings of any kind.  She's only in it for a night of sex - nothing more.One fateful night a group of American gents are meeting their italian friend for dinner and drinks at the restaurant.  The gents are instantly enamored of Lexi and she is happy to flirt with them until their friend arrives.  Here is a peek into Lexi's thoughts when she sees the friend:""WOW, was pretty much the first and only word that came into my mind.  He was tall.  I didn't really know how tall, but he was tall enough that even in my highest heels he would still tower over me.  Not that I was measuring him, and if I was I'd rather take my ruler to something other than his height.""Stefania gets all quiet and funny when she sees the friend too.  She tries to warn Lexi that Riccardo is Riccardo Cassius of the Cassius family.  Lexi agrees to go on a date with Riccardo despite Stefania's warnings about his mob-like family.  Riccardo and Lexi hit it off and wind up spending the night together.  You'll have to read about what happens when she tries to leave in the morning - it is too funny.  Irregardless of how it began, Riccardo and Lexi keep seeing each other publicly but it's not a ""real"" relationship per their agreement.So I am guessing you want to know how Lexi winds up back in Australia - I can't tell you - it'd spoil the book.  What I can tell you is that T. Gephart does throw us a bone in the end - although this is the last of the Lexi series - the band Power Station continues to live on in subsequent books.I enjoyed reading Lexi.  I feel she (the author) does Lexi, the character, justice although I would have liked to seen more lead up to the big break-up.  The book definitely gave good insight into how Lexi became the ball-buster that she is.  T. Gephart has a way with characters - I love the dialogue the characters have with one another and the smart-alecky comments.  I can almost see the characters playing out the scenes before my eyes.  Although this may be the last book of Lexi, I have feeling she will be putting in an appearance in the Power Station books.  T. Gephart if you are listening - do Riccardo, Emma, Mark and Stefania get their own books too?A complimentary copy of Lexi was provided in exchange for an honest review."

Miranda is determined to show she and her sisters aren't like the rest of her family in the town of Salvation, bad news.  She's smart and sassy with a good heart.  Her relationship with her sisters and Ruby Sue the diner owner are fun to watch. At first I wasn't sure about Logan, but he quickly grew on me.  He's sexy, smart and a good friend.  His friendship with Hud is funny and supportive.  Hud is a diamond in the rough but he's got me hooked and wanting to know more and hoping to see a book about him!  Sean the assistant brewmaster had me drawn in as well.  I think he has huge potential and wishing I saw more of him as well with more interaction with Natalie, Miranda's sister.

I have too many books on my TBR pile to add more but I did read the excerpt from Her Temporary Hero and it hooked me so I purchased the book.  This is a very well written story with some interesting characters.  Becky Holmes and Logan Knight need each other.  Becky to keep her baby and Logan to keep his land.  A marriage of convince is the solution but it brings additional problems.  I read it in one sitting and enjoyed it enough that I purchased book #1 in the series.

This book started with Paul's version of the last two chapters and went on for 5 chapters. It kinda dragged for me until it got to the point of what the prologue alluded to happening. It's always good to see Andre again and the Flynn's. Now I need the brother's story.

I was worried about how to replace sugar in barbecue sauce or ketchup but the author propose interesting substitutes like added fruits and no sugar ketchup. There are 15 barbecue sauces recipes and 15 main meals and sides. I can't wait to try the grilled pork chop with basil and mustard or the grilled Brussels sprouts BBQ side dish.

She complained over what happened to the point that I wanted Nathan to let her go.  She was obsessed with him yet couldn't get over what happened.  She didn't want to be with him yet came to him repeatedly to tell him what he did wrong..like if you want to move on..move on already!!  Quit going to his office demanding answers for the same questions over & over again!  What's the point?  It makes her look like a crazy psycho stalker!!  It was over the top for me.  The sex is hot but her bipolar attitude dried it up for me.  I really enjoyed the first 3 books of a Pulse but the 4th book was dissapointing.  Vain seems like a good book but I hope it doesn't go downhill like this one.

"07 8, 2014",B00LKJU1KO,5.0,Recommended!,A11US7VEC93CT6,"I had never read a Amish romance until the past few months and I am amazed to say how much I enjoy them. And the same goes for this story! I really enjoyed how the characters were written - I almost felt as if I knew them and was a bystander just watching the events in this story happen. Mary, Willis, David & Sarah - I liked them all but I felt as if I could understand Mary's point of view the best and felt most connected to her. This is a great way to start off the series and I can't wait to read the next one coming up."

"07 7, 2014",B00LKQNFVE,5.0,When is the next collaboration of these fabulous authors?,ABXKY8Y2U3KIJ,"Finally we have a fantastic collection of some of the best authors out here today all together in this sexy hot box series. I mean the cover alone is enough to draw a reader in!! ;)  I have read stories in the past from almost all the authors featured in this box series and I couldn't wait like many others to start reading! This set contains everything from Alpha sexy males to Mafia Enforcers to Paranormal!The first book i read was Raw Exposure by Aliyah Burke. I was anxious and excited about this story. If you are a big fan of her SEALs series then you were familiar with the main characters of Reeve (Scott's brother) and Affrica (Adrian's sister). If you haven't read all the books in that series please do. They are great reads I love all her sexy Alpha SEALs! From the beginning of the story Reeve was a hot headed self centered always managing to put his foot in his mouth when it came to everyone he interacted with. I did feel sorry at times because he appeared to be a little boy trying to survive in a big man 's world. The fact that he wasn't close to any of his siblings because of his hot temper and antics and he had absolutely no clue about a secret one of his siblings was keeping from him. It seemed everyone knew (including me the reader) but Reeve. Although I loved Affrica sister of SEAL Adrian O'Shea, profession she seemed at times cold. I just didn't connect with her during the story. I wished more scenes and the majority of the story was written with Affrica and Reeve spending more time together as a couple arguing and getting to know each other than with her always gone on an assignment/in danger somewhere and Reeve showing up. I believe that was why I couldn't connect with them because to me it seemed like they never spent any true time together. I still love Aliyah's work but this one was not one of my favorites.The second story i read was Rallenti by Sienna Mynx. I love the Battaglia Mafia series. This was a novella that takes place after Mira and Gio have their twins. This story had everything hot sex, danger,and of course romance. Renaldo Cracchiolo is an enforcer that falls in love with Kyra Okeeno, a smart as a whip dreams to be shoe designer from New York. The chemistry between these two was beautiful and enchanting. I loved Renaldo's character the quiet strong Sicilian the way he spoke to her their interaction was beautiful. At times i laughed out loud when Kyra and Bette went back in forth. And Jamie,Kyra's best friend was a trip. I have to say the ending was the best, the stalker crazed boyfriend, the murder it was a great way to end this novella. I can't wait to read the next installment of this fantastic Mafia Series. For the fans Marietta with her crazy self is in this story along with Catalina,Dreamy Domi and even Donna Mira herself.Pepper Pace's book Everything is Everything I love the story already. This is my first time reading a story by this author. I always heard wonderful things about her and my friends have always sung her praises, and I am finally seeing why. She's a great author and a fantastic and descriptive storyteller. She is taking me back to my childhood with her descriptions. Lol I was holding my breath during some scenes like ohhh no bring Scott and Vanessa back together please please then well you just have to read it to find out.... :)"
"07 21, 2014",B00LKRN0B8,4.0,Fun Fast Read,AU9VIJALGE399,"Wow!!! This is the first book I have read of Noelle Adams and I will be back for more.

"07 8, 2014",B00LLDZ4KG,5.0,A TRUE PAGE-TURNER!!!,A3LGZ7A3WSV3JJ,"OMG, SEVYN MCCRAY is the TRUTH. LOVE AND TRAPHOUSES ATLANTA was a TRUE PAGE-TURNER. It was a SMOOTH READ, FINISHED in a FEW HOURS. The JEALOUSY from ONE of the MAIN CHARACTER'S was THROUGH the ROOF, they were CONSUMED BY it. That JEALOUSLY LED to HATE, BACKSTABBING, BETRAYAL and GRIMINESS to the FULLEST. MANY REVELATIONS, I KNOW IS GOING to TURN THEIR WORLD UPSIDE DOWN. With ALL THAT GOING ON, LOVE was in the MIX TOO. PART 2 CAN'T GET RELEASED FAST ENOUGH. I ENJOYED and LOVED READING LOVE AND TRAPHOUSES ATLANTA. It's a MUST READ, I'm SURE YOU WILL TOO............."
"07 9, 2014",B00LMI44GA,5.0,Amazing.....,A3D8RT6V1XRF5T,"Amazing.....This was given to me in an exchange for a honest review by the author.  This book is amazing, it shows you how things can change dramatically for someone and how one person can bring a person alive.  I enjoyed how their relationship seemed to grow but loved how David was able to bring avery full circle.  It is amazing how much we depend on our hearing and how one can think everything is over when its lost.  I like how avery was shown how to live through emotions and some pain so she could be all she was destined to be."
"07 18, 2014",B00LR8GWOM,5.0,Get The Greek,A2JZCZYHNQHSCP,I have always been a fan of Greek food and am loving the recipes inside. I can honestly say some of them I have never even tried before. I really enjoyed the Greek Spiced Squid and Turkey Sausage Meal. Both were easy to make and bursting with flavor. I think no matter what your tastes you will find recipes inside that you love.
"07 15, 2014",B00LS3N4WY,5.0,Maddox.... swoon,A1168ILANAUMV8,"I love Maddox and have from the first time he was introduced in this series.  I also love Ellie and all of her strength and endurance as she faced the evil in her past, so reading this was a no brainer for me.  I loved it.  I got to see more of Ellie and Maddox together, more about their lives as new parents, and  a glimpse of what the future might hold for the pack in Carrie Ann's next shifter series.  If you are a fan of this series, you will want to read this.  If you have not read book seven, you can still read and love this, but be warned that there is a major spoiler for book 7 in here.  I miss the Redwood Pack already."
"07 16, 2014",B00LTCJ7RU,3.0,again...,A197W8MNF706HT,Turning what could be a trashy novel (which I love by the way) into a story about the love of family and pack.

"07 21, 2014",B00LZ0ZL1C,5.0,Lily White Does it AGAIN!,A20CM886HSEUWB,"Holly has grown up immersed deep within the Dominion motorcycle club. She was born and raised by bikers; it&#8217;s all she&#8217;s ever known. She knows that they will always look out for her, no matter what. It didn&#8217;t help that she was the daughter of the President of the club.When Holly is kidnapped by a rival gang, she doesn&#8217;t expect her life to take the turn that it does. She doesn&#8217;t expect to meet a man, JD, and fall for him. And she doesn&#8217;t expect for him to leave her, allowing her to be raped, beaten, and in a first row seat to the killing and torturing of three men.It was JD&#8217;s decision to leave Holly in the hands of a revered drug lord that led to the events that followed. Holly went through things that no one should ever go through, and when she was taken, AGAIN, she had to go through even more of it. Little did she know that she had worked her way into the heart of JD and after doing what he needed to do, he was out to save her.The world of MCs is a brutal one. They kill and they torture, smiling and laughing all while they do it. Can JD survive on this journey to save the woman that may have finally claimed his heart?I really have no words for this. Her Master&#8217;s Courtesan is my top read of the year, and my favorite Lily White book, but this book, Hard Roads, is a close second. It has everything I need in a dark book. Lily White is the one to turn to if you&#8217;re looking for a dark erotic romance that will take your breath away.Here&#8217;s why this is so good. It&#8217;s brutal. It&#8217;s gruesome, man is it gruesome. Reader discretion is advised here. If you&#8217;re squeamish either avoid this book or skip over those parts&#8230; It&#8217;s dark, it has everything I need. The pain, the emotion, the anguish, the taboo subjects. It just grabs you and sucks you in. You can&#8217;t help but be fascinated by the horrible things that happen to these characters.I know it sounds bad, but I absolutely love it. I love the strength these characters possess, the fight they have to make it through. I mean, if the main character was weak, that wouldn&#8217;t be a good story. I love the relationship that buds between these two, only to be ripped apart and destroyed but bad men. I cannot praise this book enough. Lily White has done it again!As I said, this is a dark erotic romance. And it discusses things that some people would not enjoy. As defined by the dictionary:Dark [dahrk]AdjectiveHaving very little or no lightRadiating, admitting, or reflecting little lightSo now that you have added a new word to your vocabulary, please keep this in mind. I do not want you to go in, read it and hate it because you didn&#8217;t like the subject matter. I don&#8217;t want you to leave a bad review because someone didn&#8217;t warn you. I did. I warned you.Five, six, seven, WAIT ONE THOUSAND stars for Lily White and Hard Roads. I don&#8217;t really like MC books that much, but man, I love this one."
