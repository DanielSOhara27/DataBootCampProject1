The fit was true to size which was another excellent feature.  The only drawback is when those 18 hours come along it starts getting a little uncomfortable, but for it's time for bed anyway.  I am very happy with this bra and the comfort straps really are comfortable.I would recommend this, especially for full figured gals who are tired of underwires stabbing them."

2013-09-25,I135310003,5.0,Great hosiery,"[['Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Women'], ['Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Novelty, Costumes & More', 'Exotic Apparel']]","I bought these to go with a bustier with garter and they were a perfect fit.  Even after one of my bustier garter clasps broke, I could still wear these with the bustier because of the rubber inside the top.  They stay up perfectly.  My husband LOVES touching my legs in these things so I plan on getting a few more pairs to have as needed."

Seem a little on the larger side, but that's better than smaller. Easy to slip on and off and stay on feet."

Cute enough to be worn with casual summer dresses and skirt they are sturdy enough and comfortable enough to make walking long distances appealing. The same with standing for long periods. There is a reason that so many nurses and doctors wear the standard Dansko Clog.These do look like the little summer sneakers we love to wear around. Dansko quality is also unmatched. I own 2 pairs of clogs and a pair of boots by Dansko, all of which have lasted years and all of which still look well and are comfortable when worn. Worth the investment. I see from some reviews that some people with foot problems don't like these. Not every shoe is for everybody. Most people love Dansko, so give their ergonomic foot bed and arch support a try and see if it works with your foot. Highest possible recommendation."

Just to let you know, the sleeves on the item are cloth and made of a stretchy material. I really like the way it fits, i take a size Large in shirts these days and i ordered an XL just to be safe, it fits well, all in all i am very happy with this purchase. And ordering a size up payed off, the shirt fits perfectly."

It fits: my Macbook 13&#34; Air in a neoprene case, thin folders, my Kleen Kanteen, wallet, snack, cell phone, lotion, and assorted personal items -- basically, everything I need for a full day of school!This bag can take a lot of weight, and it's held up really well. Because of the way the handles are wrapped and the material, it doesn't seem like I'll need to worry about fraying handles (what killed my other school bags). The only thing is that the black band around the lock fell off after about 6 months of use, but I just chipped the glue off with the edge of a steel ruler, and it looks fine.I recommend it!"

Clean and simple lines, well made, thick stitching and the absolute best prices on the planet. These are not Hanes or Fruit of the Looms, more like Costco or higher end tee's. Buy several. My husband is 6'4, 200lbs, XL is slightly too large, my friend is 6', 215 lbs, the xl fits him perfectly."

While this belt is not the type I would wear for with a suit or other than with casual clothes it is attractive and presents itself well.  Sizing is accurate and for the cost is totally outstanding.

The lace is a nice touch that makes it look really cute and sexy.Always hand-wash and hang- or flat-dry your bras with detergent meant for delicates!  Otherwise you're throwing your money away."
2012-12-17,I018499161,5.0,Great for those days!,"[['Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Men', 'Clothing', 'Jeans']]","Love the material and the color. Sizing is what I guess is current standards. The sizes of jeans are a changing. Found that they are great for those days when you don't want something on that is a snug as Slim Straights, which is what I generally wear. There is plenty of room to move without swimming in them. Great jeans for the money!"

DONT BUY IT!,"[['Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Women', 'Clothing', 'Dresses', 'Night Out & Cocktail']]","This dress is simply horrible! the material is too thin, the quality is poor, fits bad, it looks so much better on the picture, but when I received it i was extremely disappointed. I've purchased lots of clothing for such price or even cheaper, but i've never had such a disappointment!"

2013-12-4,I686693620,4.0,Should be fine,"[['Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Women', 'Shoes', 'Flats']]","I bought these to take on a cruise.  They're lightweight, the grey color will &#34;go with&#34; almost everything, and they were inexpensive enough that if they take a beating throughout the vacation, they can be disposable.  The workmanship isn't great, but that's OK for the reason I ordered them  Haven't worn them for a length of time yet, but after trying them on I expect they'll be comfortable.  I feel they were a smart buy for my purpose.Earlier I bought the same shoe in a half-size larger (6-1/2) in the suede look.  They were enormous.  I'll keep them, anyhow, to wear around the house."

They feel great.  They are easily the most comfortable shoe I have worn in years, and my feet are getting harder to please. The all leather upper is a plus.  The shoe looks good.  The moc toe is a bit of a minus for me, as the stitching around the toe has failed due to the punishment I put the shoe through.  I easily fixed the problem, to my surprise, with some waxed thread and a needle in about 15 minutes.  The repair looks good as new, and will outlast the shoe.  They are a bit on the warm side, but tolerable.  The sole is wearing well.  I will look for another pair when these finally wear out."

It is okay for short distance walking and sitting. It is quite soft and does not help with heel pain or foot support.  I have only worn them once.  I put them on after I got to my office.  I could not walk around in them too much because my heel began to hurt.  If I had not worn them, I would have returned them."

I grew up thinking that all wool products were itchy and uncomfortable.  After wearing Merino, I don't think that I could ever go back to the synthetics like BodyArmor and other brands employ.  The Merino kept me warm when out in the freezing temperatures of New York but cool enough to wear indoors with the heater on, too -- Hell, I have worn it on several early morning hikes after returning to Arizona.  Extremely comfortable and doesn't pill when washed like another merino shirt that I ordered."

These fit around the legs almost like boxer briefs. Good quality material, nice design. These don't ride up like a lot of boxers do.

It's a little big, but that is okay because I like clothing to be somewhat a little larger to allow for shrinking and also for comfort."

Not terrible, but it would have been nice to know before purchasing. Also, it's really stinky. Smells as if it just came out of the printing press and didn't get enough time to dry and air out before being confined into an international delivery package.Design wise, it's very cute :)"

When she first put it on she was delighted, but once she got to her ballet class it became clear that there was just not enough stretch left and the leotard was uncomfortable to dance in.  Rather than pay to return it (I live in the Middle East) I simple ordered another leotard in the next size up and this fitted perfectly."

After learning about correct bra fitting on reddit (/r/abrathatfits), I finally found the right size and shape for me. It's pretty, it holds up well for daily wear, and it comes in different colors.

I'm always a little leery of buying shoes online without trying them on, but the 8 1/2 fit true. I'm usually an 8 in heels or flats (no socks), and an 8 1/2 or 9 in sneakers. The 8 1/2 feels very good. I wish the shape of the toe was a little more oval (it's a little too square/flat for my taste, looking like it &#34;chops off&#34; my toes), but it's no big deal. They have a nice low profile from the side, of which I'm a fan."

Top is large but the dress is very pretty!,"[['Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Women', 'Clothing', 'Dresses', 'Special Occasion']]","This dress is really pretty and FUN! I hate that the top is too large for my 36C bust. Im between a 10&12 and ordered the 12 which im glad I did because the zipper was barely getting up otherwise. There are three rows of rhinestones on the empire waist, making your waist seem smaller-who doesn't love that! I ordered two Ever Pretty shawls to go with too-&#34;Fuschia & Aqua&#34; and that combo would have been amazing with the dress had it worked for me. I highly recommend to others to add these shawls/wraps. Unfortunately I need to ship it back because the top was too large- as in way too large. That was a wardwrobe malfunction in the making- lol. Oh- length wise....I am 5'2-5'3&#34; and the longest part hit the floor without heels. The shortest was knee length- perfect! Did I mention the colors are amazing! I love Ever Pretty! This is the only place I will shop for special occasion dresses from now on. Their service is amazing as well as their products! Cant beat that!"

2010-07-16,I437195538,5.0,Feels soft as a feather...,"[['Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Women', 'Accessories', 'Scarves & Wraps', 'Fashion Scarves']]","I ordered this scarf in red because it matches my black flip-flops that are adorned with shiny red roses. I wanted something to match that would look good with jeans and several tops in my wardrobe. Since I'm a ""funky"" kind of gal, the peace signs in the pattern appealed to me, also, and the size is perfect, allowing me to fashion it in a variety of styles.I wasn't exactly sure what ""viscose"" is and feared it might be rough and scratchy. So when this pretty scarf arrived, the first thing I did was toss it around my neck to get a feel for the texture. I was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable and light it felt. When I run my fingers across the material, it feels soft as feathers. To wax poetic, it feels as I imagine a fleecy cloud would feel. :-)I loooooooove my new scarf so much I'm wearing it to a friend's birthday BBQ tomorrow. In fact, I'm going back to order several in different colors. Highly recommended!Reviewed by Betty Dravis, July 16, 2010Author of ""Dream Reachers"" (with Chase Von) and other books"

They add a great pop of color to any outfit.  My only complaint is that they are a bit snug.  They're getting more flexible and comfortable the more I wear them but I would definitely recommend planning on breaking them in before wearing them too long.

If you're not into a baggy fit, don't order this shirt.  I put a silver chain belt around my hips (got the gray shirt), and it looks awesome!  I'm wearing it with Old Navy Rockstar jeans (light denim with distressed holes) and black calf high boots.  It also looked great with cutoff light denim distressed short and gladiator sandals in black.  I'll be wearing this a lot!As far as the design, I love it.  I'm 38 years old, and I don't think it's too young for me.  If it is, who cares, lol.Here's a picture I took wearing it:[...]"

I usually get the super cheap Chandra i think its called, from a store with a red bullseye but oddly, they think people only wear slippers at Christmas so if yours wear out, you have to wait until November for your size to be widely available (7-7.5).  These are almost the same shoe, with the same strong support and bottom, same cushioned feel, good looking and accurate sizing- at 3x's the sale price of the Chandra ($8). The sole is not as thick as the Chandra but it doesn't seem to effect the support quality so it's okay. But my feet have been killing me from my old slippers having no more support left so I couldn't wait any longer.Bought a size 7 (I get the other in 7.5) - these fit perfectly except I would rather have the half size bigger for my thick furry socks. But they still can be worn with my socks so it works just fine. Accurate sizing matters - I tried Isotoner in a 7.5-8 and my foot hung off the back and the regular was so narrow, there was no fitting it with anything but a bare foot and then they were still much too short, not anywhere close to what is considered ""standard"" 7-7.5 much less 7.5-8 which should be too big on my 7 foot. So sizing should give them a bonus star for being a size that I typically would wear in any shoe.  THANK YOU for not wasting my money on a huge size 7 or a tiny tiny size 7!Accurate sizingStrong supportRubber sole - stiff with cushioned footbedVery comfortableGood LookingCONS:No half sizes availablePrice - it hurts to spend $30 on a slipper when I usually spend $8, $12 if I can't wait for a sale, like now."

So I ordered this one January this year, and more than half a year later of usage, I'm a bit iffy on the quality.The belt itself is sturdy, made of clear plastic that isn't flimsy, which I liked. Based on other reviews about this belt I agree that it has a little bulge on the adjustment loop portion -- but to me that's not much of an issue, as I don't wear super-fit shirts anyway (I wear it more so to remediate the gaping waistline issue), but I can see how that poses a problem to people who want to wear fitted shirts over it.The buckles and adjustment loops are strong enough. I do wish they have this in a more ""translucent"" plastic, as during my usage the indigo jeans tend to bleed out and stain the edges of this belt, so it's not so ""invisible"" anymore when you use it on khakis (or maybe get the black one to wear it with dark jeans -- I just wanted to get the clear one expecting it to be flexible for dark and light pants).The main reason why I'm saying it's ""just OK"" is that while I do not wear the belt frequently the past 6 months (not all of my pants need the belt), the stitching that holds the buckle is not too strong. Right now the stitching is starting to snap off bit by bit and I'm pretty sure it's not going to last on the next wear. I am not  even putting stress on it (I don't force my belt too tightly) -- I'd say that they need to improve the quality of the stitching -- maybe make a double parallel stitch rather than just one?Anyhow, there aren't really better options that I like out there for ""invisible belts"" so I'm going to give Invisibelt another chance. Hopefully my 2nd one lasts longer."

If you want a thermal top that will only be used on rare occasions (for example, winter trips where you'll be outdoors in the snow a lot) then fine. Save the money, but don't buy this.  Buy the Indera.Essential Items' product, which is after all labeled &#34;Essential Apparel&#34;, not &#34;Occasional Apparel&#34;, does not stand up well to daily use.  My guy lives in them whenever he is not working. I hang my head in shame to have placed this in his stocking (along with Indera's, which merits one more star), when I should have shelled out for Ralph Lauren's, which he deserves--heavier weight (and much warmer), closer threads, tight weave, well finished--than this ridiculous thing, which is nearly ready for the rag bag.I should have known from the price not to have high expectations, but it was well rated on amazon.com, so I bought it.  I left the tag in so I can avoid making the same mistake twice.

It hugs the peak of the shoulders snug enough to make it a little uncomfortable if you need to move around alot, which would be fine for a shirt, but since your wearing a shirt under this, it is a little uncomfortable.I can wear form fitting shirts under this but forget a tshirt. I would have liked the jacket to be a little longer as well. Fleece is nice and thick but it does look to be see through if you hold it up to the light. I am hesitant to wash this as I feel it will shrink and be even smaller through shoulders. Overall I am pleased with this purchase but I feel the shoulder fit doesn't match the rest of the jacket fit. The collar could be thinner for me too, so it lays nicer.

I knew the top and bottom would be polished silver, but no it's at the bottom of the main sapphire and it's NOT centered.  It looks awkward off to the side.. that is if you can even tell it is there.The ring doesn't fit in my jewelry box either due to it's size, I guess I should have thought about that.Given being able to do it again, I would give it some major thought and might still do it because it matches a bracelet I bought off here, but I would have given so much for it ($35)."

(Some reviewers had this issue with the wires up under your arms, but I didn't have trouble there--only in the center.) This happened with all 4 of the sizes, so I think it's an issue of the make vs personal fit.Also, this definitely gives you a 50s torpedo shape to your bustline. Even with the underwire issue, it was pretty and priced well enough that I considered keeping it ... until I put on a shirt and looked in the mirror. Everything was very high, separated, and pointy. I know some women like that lift, but as a somewhat younger consumer (29) I prefer a more rounded, natural look.You also don't really get any cleavage line since everything is lifted so far apart. Again, that may be preferable for you."

The ones I got look like they have octopus suckers on the sides and little square nubs in the center. Very bizarre looking but very sticky. These soles come on the standard Jungle Mocs.Edited 11/30/12: I just got my second pair. What a difference. As great as these shoes are they don't last forever, so treat yourself to a new pair when the soles wear down. They feel awesome again!"

I am thick through the waist, hips and thighs. The 512 and 542 Levi's styles are the most comfortable for my shape.  The sizing is unpredictable/inconsistent so if you don't have the patience to deal with that inconvenience then you may want to seek a different brand.  For me, no other brand compares.  I ordered 3 pairs of this style in the same size but all different colors.  Two pairs measured 37&#34;-38&#34; in the waist - perfect.  One pair (unscripted) measured 34&#34; in the waist - too small.  Other than the sizing issues, these jeans are very comfortable.  They hug in a way that looks good on a plus size woman.  The back pockets are positioned perfectly. The tummy panel is great with one exception - very shallow front pockets.  I carry nothing important in the front pockets because they are so shallow. That's not really an issue for me as don't carry things in my pockets anyway.  In the rare need for pockets, the back pockets are my choice. They are boot cut but not too wide as is the case with many other boot cut jeans.  I don't like the flare leg look nor do I like the skinny leg look. I simply love these jeans!!Regarding my experience with sizing:Being a repeat Levi's customer for 30+ years; I have noticed what seems to be a trend depending on where the jeans were made. First, let me emphasize that when these were made exclusively in the USA, I wore the 550 style and I never encountered erratic sizing issues to the point of &#34;doesn't fit at all&#34; that I sometimes encounter now.  As with most clothing brands, they started manufacturing in other countries in order to compete and to stay in business.  When ordered in my normal size:-Made in China runs between too small to perfect sizing.-Made in Pakistan runs between perfect sizing to too large.-I have never received jeans made in China that were too large and I have never received jeans made in Pakistan that were too small.-Made in Pakistan is more often perfect sizing than those Made in China. (In my recent order, 2 pairs from Pakistan fit perfect while one pair from China was too small)OK, I know that may not be very helpful but I wanted to share it because this explains why one reviewer states; these jeans are too small, the next reviewer states; these jeans are too big, and then the next reviewer states; I should have just ordered my normal size.  In my experience I find it is best to just order my normal size because I win more often that way.  Notice that I said more often, not always. It is most probable that hundreds of happy customers order their normal size and simply do not bother to write reviews."

This wallet, as you can see from the product image, is more rectangular and is easier to get in and out of my pocket.There are two rather minor items that caused me to withdraw one star.  First, some of the card slots on the center flap are too narrow to hold the standard credit cards.  These are cards that fit without a problem in any of the six slots on the main part of the wallet.  That reduced the number of useable card slots from nine to seven.  The other two are usable for things like membership cards, without a magnetic stripe, if you trim about 1/16th of an inch off the card.The other item is a real nit.

I found myself going over it over and over again till I happen to stumble upon the right sequences to set the watch correctly.I'm an avid watch collector and some of my very high end time pieces are easier to set up than this watch from Citizen. The alarm is perfect and does the job of waking me up from my slumber. I have yet to see the effectiveness and potental of the perpertual calendar.The uni-directional bezel is way to tight when turning counter-clockwise, I almost thought it was defective at first.

Most electronic gear (radios, watches, etc.) flip you out of the setting screen, back to the function screen too fast. This watch gives you about a minute, making the setting very easy for my clumsy hands and slow brain. After setting the time, date, including the year, you must choose a city to indicate your time zone. That's it. Now the watch has the phases of the moon, the tides, and the UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) for your time zone. If you need precise tides, you can enter the exact time of high tide in your area. I learned a lot about the moon and tides (there are different tides!) setting up this watch and checking its functions.This is a lot of watch for very little money."

So why am I posting a review now?Because I received a superior service from Timex that warrants a write-up.After years of faithful service the wrist band on the Ironman watch came off on one side. I looked up where I can find a replacement and found that Timex will replace the band on its watches for free.I called the 800 number and sure enough, they told me to package it up, write a note that it is for band replacement only, told me to enclose a check for a very modest shipping cost to send it back to me. Four weeks later  and my watch arrived back: new band and the back looks shinier. Looks like they cleaned its exterior as well.This has been one of my favorite watches1) I like the nice clear large display. Easy to see even with my now presbyopic eyes.2) Setting the watch is easy without a manual3) There is enough useful features, but not so many that the it makes it too complex to do simple things4) Even though it is a men's watch I a female who wear is and I don't find it heavy or bulky5) I like the plastic watch band. My previous Timex had a Velcro band and eventually it picked up a lot of lint it did not close well. And now that I found that Timex will replace it for a cost of shipping it back, I am even more pleased with it.6) The battery lasts a reasonable time, I have to replace it every 2-3 years. Not often enough to be annoying. The battery in my ""dressed-up"" watch lasts only a year.I am very pleased with the watch, and now extremely pleased with the service as well.Ali Julia review"

I am a 33B, so I ordered 32B and 34B because depending on the style, I can fit into either one. In this instance, the 32B was WAY too small. I could barely get it to fasten around my back. And once it was fastened, I felt like it was cutting off circulation! I returned it. The 34B fits as expected. Very comfortable so far. I have only used it for a couple short 6 mile runs, and there were no irritations or hot spots. The real test will be when I run more than 13 miles in it. That seems to be when any irritations occur. It is a bit of a struggle to put on. The trick is to keep the top latch in the back fastened, and then put it on like a tank top. Then I am able to get the lower back hooks fastened without too much trouble. If I didn't leave the top hooks fastened, I would definitely need someone to help me with it, once on."

I wet a paper towel with Windex and wiped it down - problem solved. It's exactly what I needed as far as keeping all my cards together. My only issue with the one I received (I bought it in burgundy) is that every other card slot runs the length of the wallet, so you are in danger of losing a card down inside the slot. I would prefer that they were all card sized in depth. The width is fine, holds the cards securely and all of the slots are leather on mine, not mesh as someone said the one they received was. If you use all of the card slots, there really isn't room for a checkbook, but there are pockets behind the cards for receipts or cash. It's slim and fits in my purse as well or better than a regular wallet.  I think it will look better with time, as most leather does."

Second best shoes are these for many reasons.Firstly, I find it funny that people whinge about this shoe, but honestly what is better than this shoe in the market for trail running and general exercise - nothing! thats right folks nothing is better than this shoe for the above functions. If someone is not happy with this shoe they are being overly precious.Unlike a lot of reviewers I have flat feet so I need to be very astute when buying shoes because if not designed correctly they are complete waste of money. I am lucky that I can afford to spent thousands on shoes to find the right shoe and I have purchase all if not most of the major brands. After spending many thousands all roads lead back to Saloman.This shoe is awesome, the feel, the fit, the design, the construction all scream quality. When I exercise in them they hold my foot in a neutral position and I don't over pronate which is a sign of quality for someone with rubbish feet like myself.In my opinion the true test of a shoe is not how shoes function with good feet, its how they function with people was bad feet. If you have high arches you can run bare feet or in just about any shoe, but not with people with very flat feet.If you are on the fence with these shoes just get them."

That would normally be a woman 9.5 or man 8 in US sizing and falls between small and medium in these, on the sizing chart.

Perfect, in fact.I have had other toe socks and am delighted with the superior quality of these, which are 70% Coolmax, 25% Nylon and 10% Lycra. I normally like the moisture absorption of cotton, but over the years have come to be even more fond of the wickingness of Coolmax, and definitely like the durability of Nylon and the lovely caress of Lycra.I immediately ordered three more pairs of these socks. They are, of course, just what I need for my Vibram FiveFinger Seeya running slippers, but also I love having my toes separated in regular shoes, both in warmer weather and as liner sox during the cold New England winters, now that I've gotten used to that feel. I first purchased toe socks 'way back in the 1970s when living in Seattle and shopping at Uwajimaya (did I spell that right?) as they are traditionally worn in Japanese culture.

The shoes do run a bit small; I ended up with an 8.5 when I normally wear 8s (or 39s in the Vibrams).The sole tread seems more stable on wet/slippery surfaces than the tread pattern on the vibram shoes, and these shoes do not chafe if you manage to get caught in a deluge; the downside is that these shoes take days to dry out if they get soaked. (so, great *in* rain, but long recovery.) No pressure on my achilles, and no real break-in required. v2 is definitely lighter than the original, which is amazing to me.Downsides: the sole is very soft, and will wear fairly quickly. I have a pair with giant holes on the ball of my foot, oops. The v2 toe box is definitely wider than the original WT10, and so my foot is a little less secure than I would wish.That said, these are very nice minimalist shoes.

I got the 2x/3x and I am about 5'8 and about 175lbs. I usually wear a 14 but most of my weight is concentrated around my tummy (gotta love being an Apple body type) and I wanted something that would pull that in and give me more of an hourglass silhouette. I have tried a few other pieces of shape wear in the past but this was the first I tried that had a hook and eye closure and boning as opposed to the stretchy pull-on styles which seemed to roll a lot. I loved that this really targeted the problem areas for me and that it was long enough to pull down all the way over my tummy. However, I am short-waisted and long-legged so I think this could potentially not be long enough for someone with a really long torso who is trying to cover up that lower belly fat. I loved that it came up just high enough not to interfere with my bra and seemed to be made of quality material. It was more comfortable than I thought it was going to be and I wore it to three different events.  Definitely glad I did the research and decided on this waist cincher because of the reviews."

Hard to see that the fabric has a glossy sheen to it when worn. Fabric breathes well, is comfy to wear working out but due to my bad choice in sizing I do not leave the house in it. If you really have a great athletic body then this will be a great shirt to show off your tight figure without showing too much skin.  If you don't already have the perfect athletic body you might want to think about getting a size up. I  got the XXL even though I most often take an XL but in this case the shirt that is meant to be form fitted is a wee bit tight and does not flatter any less than perfect figure flaws, rather it highlights the extra tire. The cut of the shirt will still give the form fitting look but might give you some leverage in the not so pretty areas. I am five foot nine and despite the fact that it is snug the length on me is pretty true to the picture shown. Keeping on the treadmill instead of returning it and in a few more pounds it will probably be a wardrobe favorite."

Then pull the poncho over.The reason that it does not have a hole for your head, is because you can use this for improvising a sleeping bag, and to make shelter.  Use your imagination.  A couple of ponchos tied together, with these liners for insulation, and you can have one heck of a pup tent.But back to that hole for your head.  Just make one.  Find the middle of the poncho liner, cut a hole big enough, and hem in the edges.  Now you can tie the laces to the grommet holes of your poncho, and wear this as a liner.

Some asked if it was leather. HA! Fooled them :)It looks and feels great! I am 5'11 and weigh 145 pounds...I have a fairly small waist and decided to take a chance on the small even though it said to order a size larger. I'll admit i was a bit nervous before it arrived but as soon as it was received and tried it on, I feel in love with it! I wear a 36B Bra and the small fits great in the chest! Not tight at all. But I can see how someone with a larger chest may have a problem. There is barely any stretch in this corset! Very well could pose a problem.For me, the back of the corset does not clinch together perfectly, there is a space in the lace up (about 1 inch space) where my back is exposed. I couldn't cinch it up any farther without being able to breath but I do not mind the exposed back :)The front clasps are the only thing that I get annoyed with. Its a task to close the corset up in the front but with a little practice, you'll become a pro!This corset is sexy and will sure to turn heads....just be smart when ordering. Take a few measurements and go from there. If you have a bigger chest, I would most certainly order one or two sizes up! If you want no back exposed, i would order a size or two up! It really just depends on your figure. But if you take the chance, i don't believe you'll be disappointed!"

They are a little bouncier than most flip flops found in the U.S. Surprisingly so for the thin-ness of the sole. I find this makes walking in them for any distance, and I live in a city, alot less stressful on the heels than other flops I wear with such thin soles.  The straps that hold your foot to the flop are more V like than many other designs of the typicall flop, so I don't get scratched up by them as much as on other types of flops.  The rubber is also fairly soft in comparison to the typical injection molded cheapo flop. They run small for a US 12-13, very small.  I have a size 11.5 foot and 12 is usually pretty large on me, these were actually somewhat small, so be aware of that when ordering.  My toe comes right to the edge with my heel only having about 1/4 of an inch or less of space from the back of the flop and again, I'm an 11.5 and these are rated 12/14 M. So these run small and narrow.One word of caution, however: One common problem with Havianas is that like flip flops from the 70s, the toe part that clips into the bottom of the shoe will slip loose as they wear.  So don't run in them, as this may happen while you are running and you could trip.  I will attach a photo of what I mean.  This tends to happen to me if I do more than just very casually walk in this type of flop or if the ground is really hot as it gets here in DC in the summer on the roads."

I bought these to try an alternative to traditional woven boxer shorts and although they fit well when you first put them on, they are a knit cotton fabric and stretch way out (especially the leg openings) after a short while of wearing them. That makes them bulky and loose and all bunched up and uncomfortable under your pants. Also they are a heavier thicker cotton and feel too hot in the summer. When they get sweaty and then hold the moisture It's like having a wet facecloth in your crotch. I bought both the black and grey ones and after a couple of washes you could see the stitching getting loose in the crotch area. I'll go back to Old Navy boxers which are the best.

The watch face is a lovely mother of pearl that looks very expensive, and the numbers on the dial are easy to read for those of us with over-40 eyes.Each leather strap is also very close in color to the images on the computer screen.  There also a lot of holes in the band, which I appreciate. I'm on the smaller size, and I've had to get extra holes drilled in watch bands before, so it's nice to have a set that accommodates a wide range of wrist sizes, from small to large.I had been worried that the bands would be hard to switch out, but it's just as easy as the directions here on Amazon state -- you slide a small pin, and the new band easily locks into place.This set also comes beautifully boxed, making it a great gift.There are two negatives so far. One is that the bands are pretty stiff.  I'm sure that as I wear each one more, they will soften up, but right now they pretty inflexible and so not as comfortable to wear right out of the box as I would have liked.  The second negative is that the pin that pulls out to set the time is really hard to pull out, and, because it is smooth and doesn't have ridges on it, it is hard to spin to set the time.  I had to have my husband pull out the pin for me, and I'm not a weak person, but luckily I won't have to change the time too often.Overall, this is a really nice set and it's going to be fun to have such a wide range of options each day!"

2012-12-1,I012041121,3.0,"I had to return this one.  Plus, some info on Icebreaker wool weights, ranges, and sizing","[['Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Women', 'Clothing', 'Active', 'Active Base Layers']]","I have had this kind of Icebreaker Oasis shirt before, and last week I decided to order another one in a color that matches some new leggings that I ordered.Unfortunately, in my usual Icebreaker size, size small, the chest area of the new Oasis shirt was too tight, which I've not experienced in my other Icebreaker tops.Also, the sleeves of this new shirt were FOUR INCHES too long, 4 inches past my wrist.  Now, most of my Icebreaker shirts have sleeves that are a bit too long for me, often up to 2 inches too long, but 4 inches is something else entirely.  Some Icebreaker tops have thumb loops and are supposed to be 2 inches past the wrist so the thumbs can fit into them, but this top didn't even have thumb loops and is meant to finish at the wrist.I had to return this top.  The medium might fit me better in the chest area, but would be even longer in the arms and too big in shoulders/tummy area, so I didn't go up a size.I would give the specific top I returned 2 stars, but I went up to 3 for this review because maybe that top was a one-off factory mistake or something.-----------Some general info on Icebreaker:Because some of Amazon's listing descriptions for Icebreaker items have very few details about the products, making it difficult for the customer to make an informed purchasing decision if he/she is unfamiliar with this brand of clothing, below I'll type some information and personal impressions about Icebreaker clothing.Note that my review is quite long and usually only the first half of it is shown on this page. If this happens on your screen and you wish to read the second half, all you have to do is press the ""read more"" button at the bottom of the review and Amazon will show you the rest of it.  :-)----------------------OVERALL IMPRESSIONIcebreaker's marino wool items are generally made well, last a long time, are easy to care for, feel fantastic on the skin, are ""natural"", don't get smelly easily like polarfleece does, let the skin breathe, etc.Many of my Icebreaker items have been worn and washed several hundred times and are still holding up much better than would be expected.I am a BIG fan of this company's products.  For my overall experience of them from around 2000-2010, I would give them a solid ""5 stars""!However, I regret to say that my opinion of the items I have bought from Icebreaker in 2012 is not as high.  In the last 2 weeks (late 2012), I have bought 7 items from them and I decided to return all of them because they aren't as well-cut as the very ""same"" items that I bought in the 2000s (which I still have and wear, so I can make like-for-like comparisons easily).Based solely on my 2012 experience of Icebreaker products, I would give them 3 stars, ""it's ok"".  For me, this is not good enough to command prices of $50 - $100+ for quite simple items, even if the basic wool material itself is outstanding and long-lasting.---------------------MY EXPERIENCE WITH ICEBREAKERI bought my first Icebreaker clothing about 13 years ago when I needed some long underwear for skiing.Up until about 6 years ago, I had been buying Icebreaker items very sparingly, due to the eye-watering prices at London UK sporting goods shops .  Then, I discovered that Sierratradingpost sells various Icebreaker styles (usually discontinued items from years past) on their site for a discount. Fortunately, for a couple of years after I discovered this, they had a large selection of women's Icebreaker stuff, so I bought quite a few things for great prices. (These days, Sierra's Icebreaker selection for women appears to be smaller, and the prices comparatively higher, than before.  I expect that there are more discounters they have to compete with now, to get that kind of stock.)In addition to bricks-and-mortar sports shops and Sierratradingpost, I have also bought Icebreaker items from several sporting goods online retailers, Amazon, and the Icebreaker website.I still have almost every Icebreaker item I've bought.  Even the discounted items have been somewhat pricey, but the quality and longevity were worth the initial investment.In the last two weeks, I have tried to replace a few of my key Icebreaker items but found the fit and cut of the current versions of the same items to be sub-par.  I will keep using my old items for another year, and hope that next year's fit and cut will be better-suited to my body shape.----------------------CAVEATWhat I have written below is based on my current knowledge about their products, but it is possible that I have misunderstood some aspects of the brand.If you wish to better understand their product offerings, I would absolutely recommend that you have a look at the Icebreaker official site to view their entire range and gain more clarity about what items are for what purposes, what the wool weights are about, what the quality levels of the different clothing collections are, etc.(Unfortunately, their website, while snazzy, does not fully explain these things, leaving it up to the customer to piece some of the puzzle together.)----------------------ICEBREAKER WOOL WEIGHTS:Icebreaker's marino wool items generally come in four weights of fabric: 150, 200, 260, or 320. This is ""grams per square meter"".150 is quite thin.It provides light warmth.The material is generally see-through.  (I wouldn't wear items of this weight out and about in public without anything over them, but some reviewers have said that they do.)It's good for a first base layer, for strenuous exercise, or for sleeping in.Their items of this weight, especially in the ranges intended for athletic use, tend to be really form-fitting in one's typical size.All Icebreaker material seems VERY resilient and long-lasting to me, but because the 150 wool weight is pretty thin, it is the likeliest to be torn, develop holes, get ""runs"" (like pantyhose).  I don't think this happens too much with it, but I've seen some reviewers mention it (most often talking about how they accidentally poked holes in it with long fingernails), and three of my 150-weight leggings have developed runs in them after several years of heavy use.200 is slightly thicker, but still on the thin side.It's pretty warm.The lighter colors are definitely see-through, such as grey and cream. My older black and brown items made out of 200 weight wool don't seem to be see-through, but some of the newer dark-colored ones might be.It's good for a base layer or mid-weight layer, for exercise, and sleeping in.Especially in the ranges intended for athletic situations, their items of this weight tend to be form-fitting in one's typical size.260 is on the thicker side.It's definitely warm, a cozy weight.None of my 260 items are see-through. I can wear tops made out of this weight on their own (without anything over them) and not worry that my underwear or too many lumps&bumps; will show through.It's good for a mid-layer or top-layer, and sleeping in (if you get cold at night, like I do).Items of this weight tend to fit looser than items of the same size in the 150/200 weights do. This may have something to do with how much naturally-stretchier the thicker fabric is, but it also seems that they cut these 260-weight items bigger because this weight is often worn as a top-layer or middle-layer, instead of as a base-layer.I like this weight the best.  I think that the company says that this is their most popular weight across the board.320 is thickest, of course.It is quite warm, very toasty and sturdy.This weight is generally a top-layer, so items made out of this material are relatively loosely-cut.--------------------------ICEBREAKER LINES / RANGES / ""COLLECTIONS"" OF CLOTHING:Icebreaker makes different ranges - some intended for wearing as normal underwear (like panties and sports bras and tank tops), some intended for wearing as thermal/long underwear, some intended for wearing as everyday clothing, and some intended for wearing as athletic wear.Even though at first glance most of their items appear VERY similar to each other, there are different feelings to the fabrics (even in fabrics of the same wool weight), different quality levels, different cuts, and different design details amongst these different lines, so it is good to check their website about the particular Icebreaker item you are thinking of buying to make sure that it is intended for the activity you want it for.Two of the popular ranges at the lower end of the Icebreaker price scale are:BodyfitThe Bodyfit range seems to be for athletic situations, but also casual-wear and sleeping-in. The knit of this range's wool is usually flatter and less stretchy than the knit of the ranges that are for underwear or purely casual wear. Items in this range are usually cut to fit relatively snugly.EverydayThis range is made of a looser, thicker, stretchier knit than the Bodyfit, and is more for general sleeping-in and casual long-underwear needs, not so much for athletic situations. (However, I'm sure that they would be okay in many athletic situations, and I have worn them skiing and hiking.) Everyday items tend to be made of a stretchier knit and cut to fit more loosely than the Bodyfit items. I wear a size below my ordinary size in this range.Other rangesTheir other ranges appear to include: Black Sheep Collection, RealFleece Collection, Pure Plus Collection, Journeys Travel Collection, Premium Underwear Collection, GT Technical Sports Collection, GT Bike Collection, Technical Base Layers Collection, and Technical Mid Layers Collection. Please see the Icebreaker site for more information on their ranges.Frankly, I feel that they've made this aspect of their brand over-complicated and too confusing for the average customer, and I have not been able to locate any overview of the various collections on their site or on their product packaging materials.-----------------------ICEBREAKER COLORS:Icebreaker tends to make most items in black, as their basic universal color.Many items are offered in about 2 to 8 other colors, as well.  There is often some version of blue, red, grey, and green - sometimes a pink, sometimes a brown or purple, etc. Often the colors are skewed towards the cool end of the spectrum (which I notice because my coloring is on the warm end of the spectrum and cool tones look awful on me).The different weights of wool and/or different ranges (e.g., Bodyfit, Everyday, Journeys Travel Collection, etc.) will tend to have their own mini-set of color options.  (For example, the current grey color in the 200 Bodyfit is a medium-grey and is called ""blizzard"" and the current grey color in the 260 Bodyfit is a dark-grey and called ""metro"", and they don't offer those particular colors in other weights of wool or other ranges, as far as I know.)They change their colors every year or so (I think), and some colors tend to sell out mid-way through a season and are not restocked, so if you see an item in a color that you love, or there is a matching set (of long underwear or something) and you want both pieces in the same color, you probably should get it at the time, because it's not guaranteed that it will be available in the future.---------------------EXTRA DESIGN FLOURISHES:A couple of their ranges, mainly the more athletic lines, feature ""pops"" of contrasting color in a certain part of the garment, such as a stripe running down the sleeves or down the sides, or a triangle of bright material at the ankle. Most internet retailers' photographs of the garments do show these features because the areas of differing colors are pretty obvious, but it pays to read the item descriptions (and check out the manufacturer's site for confirmation) if this kind of thing is not what you are looking for.In a couple of their clothing ranges, mainly the underwear, 150-weight, and casual-wear lines, some of the tops and bottoms have printed patterns (like floral motifs or abstract swirls - sometimes in contrasting colors) on the sleeves or in the hip-region. This *can* escape your notice when the only images of the item you have available to you are the tiny product photographs that most internet retailers provide, so do double-check the customer reviews of the item, and maybe the Icebreaker site's own full description of the item, if you want to know for sure if the item comes with a printed pattern on a section of it.---------------------ICEBREAKER SIZING:Sizing and fit are so variable from person to person and from brand to brand, but in case it may help, I'll talk about my experiences with Icebreaker clothing.For reference, generally I am usually a women's size 4 or 6 in US sizing, a women's size 8 or 10 in UK sizing, and a small when it comes to small/medium/large sizing.  This goes for both tops and bottoms.---Sizing of TopsAlmost all of my Icebreaker tops from the last 13 years -- crew tops, long-underwear tops, turtlenecks, and zip-up jackets -- are women's size small.The only tops I have in size extra-small are from the Skin range (which they phased out in 2006, but the sizing and type of material used for the Skin range appear to be very similar to those of the current range called Everyday).Generally, I know that an Icebreaker small top is probably going to fit me.The main issue that I've had with their tops is sleeve length (too long).  This is not uncommon for me, because I do have arms that are on the petite side:  most suit jackets I buy have to be shortened a little in the sleeves, and I often have to turn up sweaters one turn at the cuff.  And one feature of some Icebreaker tops is a thumb loop which necessitates that the sleeves are meant to be about three inches longer than the wrist - I understand this, and just roll those tops up a turn or two.  However, I've read quite a few reviewers' comments that mention that Icebreaker sleeves tend to be long, and I do think that their sleeves are longer than normal.  [""Normal"" being subjective, of course!  ...the only women I've met from New Zealand actually did happen to be tall, lithe, and willowy, so maybe that's normal there.  :-) ]  Last week, I bought a 2012-made Icebreaker ""Oasis"" top in a size small, and while it was too tight in the chest area (which is normally NOT a problem for me with Icebreaker), the sleeves were a crazy four or five inches past my wrist, even though they didn't have thumb holes and therefore were meant to end at the wrist. I had to return it.---Sizing of Leggings:I have run into inconsistency in Icebreaker legging sizes. I have some in extra-small, some in small, and some in medium.  (And in one 2012 collection, the extra-smalls are a little too big for me but there isn't a smaller size to go to.)I have not found Icebreaker's official sizing chart (available on their site) to be terribly accurate for leggings.For the leggings, it seems to me that one must experiment in each Icebreaker clothing range and wool weight to discover the best size and fit for oneself.I will spell out below the ones that I have tried.  Because the sizing of the ""same"" leggings sometimes has varied across the years, I will mention what year I got them.1.  BODYFIT range1a. Bodyfit 150 leggings2006 or 2007 Bodyfit 150 leggingsSize medium. The label says ""slim fit"" (possibly back then they had different ""fits"" within the Bodyfit range, but they don't seem to now).Fit me snugly, but well.Waistband comes up to the belly button, feels secure.2008 Bodyfit 150 leggingsSize small.Are a bit too small for me this winter - they fit me when I'm about 5-to-8 pounds less than I am at the moment.Waistband hits 1 inch below the belly button, feels okay.2012 Bodyfit 150 leggingsI decided not to buy new 150-weight leggings in 2012 because after a few years of heavy use, my old Bodyfit 150 leggings developed some un-mendable ""runs""/""ladders"". I still wear them and love them, but they are slowly self-destructing. It is comparatively easy to snag them on a rough surface or to poke a fingernail through them when pulling them on or off.Actually, I've just looked on the Icebreaker site (December 2012) and they don't list ANY Bodyfit 150 leggings.  The only 150 weight leggings they list are the ""Sprite"" leggings from the Premium Underwear Collection.  Also, I think that the ""Nature"" leggings (which are a discontinued style) were of 150 weight, and I have seen these still on sale on a few websites.1b. Bodyfit 200 leggingsCurrent suggested retail price of around eighty (discounted price of around sixty).2008 Bodyfit 200 leggingsSize medium.Fit me, and there is extra room in them - I probably could go up 5 to 8 pounds and they would still fit. When I purchased those mediums, I tried on the small size and found it to be way too small, especially along the tight and narrow waistband that these leggings were made with at the time.  (I think it was a reaction to the consumer response to that waistband that they made the newer waistbands really wide and soft.)Waistband comes up to the belly button, feels secure.2012 Bodyfit 200 leggingsAt first, based on the Icebreaker official size chart, I ordered a medium in these.  They were too big, so I exchanged them for a size small.The small fit relatively well - snug, but acceptably so.Waistband came up to 2 or even 3 inches below the belly button. This is a more ""modern"" position for a waistband, of course, compared to coming up to the true waist, but I prefer ""athletic"" base layers to cover my entire body - neck to ankle, to enable the base layer shirts to be securely tucked inside the base layer pants, and to feel really secure when I'm moving around -- but this waistband was so low on me, and so wide and stretchy that it felt like it was about to slide down to my hips at any moment because the elastic wasn't very tight.Not only from the practical side was this low waistband a problem, but MAN, the whole cut of the upper part of these leggings seemed to be designed to make my tummy area look as flabby and unattractive as possible!  I tried my old leggings on when I took these off -- just to check that it wasn't bad lighting or post-Thanksgiving excess weight that was to blame for how these made me look, but my older Icebreaker Bodyfit 200 leggings looked a lot better on me than these leggings did.I had to return them.  I have decided to wait until next year's production, to see if they alter the cut of the waist area.1c. Bodyfit 260 leggingsCurrent suggested retail price of around ninety (discounted price around seventy-five).2012 Bodyfit 260 leggingsSize small.Fit relatively well - snug, but acceptably so.Waistband came up to 2 inches below the belly button. They had the same issues as the 2012 Bodyfit 200 leggings did - waistband too low, too loose, too wide, and quite unattractive in the belly region!I also had to return these.  I hope next year's will be cut higher on the waist.2.  EVERYDAY range2a. Skin 200 leggings (discontinued 2006) - the Skin range was probably similar to Everyday.2005 Skin 200 leggingsSize extra-small, yet are the largest I own - I could gain 15 pounds and they would still feel okay. But they fit me nicely when I'm at any weight - 10 pounds less or more than my present size - they are simply the coziest and softest that I own.Waistband comes to about 1 inch higher than belly button, feels secure.2b. Everyday 200 leggingsCurrent suggested retail price of around sixty (discounted price of around forty-five).2012 Everyday 200 leggingsTwo weeks ago, I bought them in size small which were too big, so I exchanged them for an extra-small.  Even the extra-smalls had extra material in places on the legs, which is unusual because my legs are not toothpicks (this kind of legging is not supposed to be baggy, so the cut of these must have been off).Worse, the upper part of the extra-small leggings was cut strangely - the waistband was in a deep V, so that the middle was 3 inches below my belly-button (which is way too low for me), but the sides rose up 3 inches higher than that (it wasn't a curve, it was a visible V).  Yet the waistband elastic wasn't tight enough, so the tall sides wanted to sag down and bunch up around my hips -- strange.  (And that was not the way the smalls I tried on the week before had fit my waist area!  In fact, I think the smalls of last week fit me better generally than the extra-smalls of this week.)  I don't have the energy to go through the rigamarole of ordering a different pair of extra-smalls, but maybe I just got a bad apple.I had to return the extra-smalls.I was very disappointed because they were the 7th Icebreaker product I've tried in the last 2 weeks.  This Icebreaker shopping quest has taken up a fair bit of my time lately, but I have nothing new to show for it.  I've given up trying to get anything now and will wait a year and see how their 2013 production fits me.3.  OTHER rangesTheir other legging types are more expensive than the Everyday and Bodyfit, and seem to be geared towards high-tech athletic use, or constructed to be worn on their own as pants/trousers. Some have Lycra in them. Check out Icebreaker's site for more info.--------------------------------OTHER TIPSThe other main retailers of this kind of product sometimes offer free shipping on their Amazon listings of an item but don't offer free shipping on the exact same item when sold through their own site (even when the price of the item itself is the same on both sites), so it can save you money if you pay attention to that.The best selection BY FAR is available from the manufacturer's site, but the prices there are generally higher. However, they have discounts from time to time, such as their ""Black Friday"" sale when they offer 30% all items that are black in color.Amazon sometimes calls the Icebreaker Bodyfit range ""BF"" and sometimes ""Bodyfit"", so if you are searching here for Icebreaker's Bodyfit range, do a separate search under each of the two search terms to get the most accurate results.In terms of merino wool socks, I prefer Smartwool socks over Icebreaker's. Sierratradingpost is one retailer which often carries a large selection of them at good prices. Those socks last a really long time. I wear them almost year-round because the lightweight ones breathe really well even when it's warm out.The Smartwool women's small size is the only sock I can find that truly fits my feet (which aren't even that small, all things considered!) without bunching up inside my shoes.If you have a smaller foot (size 7 or less) and are female, note that the Smartwool unisex socks in the small size are bigger than the smalls made just for women, even though that company's size guide says that they both are meant to fit the same range of women's shoe sizes."

It's comfortable enough to wear as a sleep/leisure bra and it offers enough light support to wear as an everyday bra. It might be a good sports bra for women with B cups, but I'm an F and for active situations, I require more support and bounce suppression than this bra offers. My favorite feature is the strap design; they never, ever slip off my shoulders, and  they provide a gentle reminder to practice good posture.My only complaints are that the straps curl up a little on the edges, so they look a little strange under my shirt.  Also, because the wrap design gives just a little more lift on the left, I occasionally get some overspill/escapage on that side.In my experience, Glamorise tends to run small, so I ordered 2"" larger than what I wear in other brands.

Unless a skirt has a lining, I always were a slip so that's not a big deal for me.  The material is great but if you get the lighter colors I would recommend a slip.

They're shiny and slippery so they didn't catch on the dress. I'm 5'3 and 118lbs, they fit fine, and you can't see through them. I'd expect them to fit up to at least 135lbs. The only reason I didn't give five stars was because of the waistline. They're those kinda pants that are cheaply made and don't really have a front or back to them. They fit the same way either way you put them on, so they kinda always feel like they're on backwards, and a little loose around the top, to account for the one size fits all. But hey, I think i paid $6 for them, i have nothing to complain about. They worked for my needs, and will be good to wear under jeans  and stuff in the winter."

This, of course is the end of my sleep for this night.  I've tried taking every nutrient known to mankind, and nothing helped.So, I decided to try these soft leg warmers.  I already knew I would like the fabric because I have socks and scarves made of it. It feels so luxurious.  The thing I wasn't sure of was whether I could actually sleep in them because my skin is so sensitive, and I thought after a while they might itch, but I've had them for about 3 weeks, and I've slept peacefully throughout (most) nights. My sleep has improved about 90%. They're long enough that when nights are cold, I can slip them right down to cover my feet as well, so I'm warm all the way from my knees to my toes.I think maybe they should come in sizes.  I considered getting some for my mom who also deals with night cramps, but I don't think they would fit her legs because they're quite a bit larger than mine. I'm 5'2"" and weight 129 lbs, and these fit perfectly.  In another review, someone said hers immediately got a hole in them. They come with a tag attached with a plastic strip run through the fabric.  Clip that strip carefully; if you jerk it out of the fabric, you're almost assured to get a hole in the area where it was pulled through. She may not have done this; I'm just sayin'.Anyway, I got a couple of pairs, one to wear and one to wash, and I think this is the beginning of a long and beautiful relationship."

It's super accurate (so far) and the second hand lines up with the markers... which is very important on a quartz watch.This one is definitely a keeper!UPDATE:I've been wearing this watch almost 24-7 since the day I got it. Last night I took it off and noticed that the metal band keeper, was wearing a hole in my wrist. Looks like I'm  going to have to find a different band for it :(UPDATE II:I was wearing the watch 24-7.. or, I was wearing it while sleeping. I stopped doing that, and the metal keeper stopped wearing a hole in my wrist... fair trade if you ask me! LOL. : )"

It's a nice length, weight to look nice and carry you through multiple seasons.  It is definitely worth the 6.99 that I paid for it.  It's a soft lightweight jersey without being too thin.Obviously, the description is wrong about the pattern.  It's clearly a straight stripe not a chevron design.  In that it is as pictured.I did have to deduct one point for two reasons:  the edges are unfinished and the color is not as pictured.  The unfinished edges were a slight disappointment but not a deal breaker.  The color pictured is a kelly green with a sharp white.  However, the scarf I recieved is more of a cream than a white.  The green is a bit shy of a kelly green, being slightly more blue.  It's still nice, but I won't be able to wear it with white as I expected.So, if you aren't trying to match the exact color, I recommend this.  If you need a very precise shade of something, I would not order this, as it very well may not match for you."

The beads consist of 4 matching beads and four that do not match. The beads seem to be of good quality and none of the insets seem in danger of falling out of the setting. Like all bracelets the clasp on this one is a bit hard to close. The extender might be handy for those with thicker wrists but I have mine closed on the tightest link anyway.It is fairly heavy on the wrist so if you dislike heavy bracelets you might want to steer clear of it. There is some jingle to it since the beads are free moving and they do tend to slip under your wrist when typing so that might be a consideration for a work day.The biggest con I can think of for this item is that the chain the beads are on is a spring design and easily catches and pulls the fine hairs at the wrist. Can be pretty uncomfortable to have a sudden sting when the bracelet moves.I'm pairing it with a similar necklace I picked up on amazon and while the reds are not an exact match it is still fairly appealing.Sterling Silver Marcasite and Gemstone Colored Glass Heart Pendant Necklace, 18""For the price, I think this was a great deal and I am very happy with it."

I ended up returning the Champions and keeping the Gold Toes. I found that the material used in the Champion socks was a little thinner and not as cushioned as the Gold Toe socks. The insides of the socks also felt somewhat rough, and I was concerned that they might get rougher with repeated washings. The Gold Toe socks seemed to be better reinforced in the toe area. But one thing I liked about the Champion socks over the Gold Toe socks was that they came up about an inch higher over my calf. So one star off for length. It was a hard decision about which ones to keep, but I've been really happy with the Gold Toes and they've held up very well.UPDATE 1/10/11As I've washed these socks, they seem to get shorter and shorter (and I don't wash them on hot water or dry them on high).  The length was short enough to begin with, but repeated washings have made them even shorter.  I am now disappointed in these socks.

These shorts include the Pearl Izumi Men's Liner Short which can be purchased separately.  The shorts are reasonably priced when you consider the cost of the liners.The material is light but stays in place as you ride.  The amount of material is not skintight nor saggy & rarely gets caught on my saddle.  The single zippered pocket is ample enough to hold a medium wallet (located on the lower portion of the right leg)  Edit:  The single, limited pocket is the worst of these shorts.  More pockets in other locations would have been very desirable.  Limit what you carry or store stuff elsewhere with these.The elastic waistband adjusts with several buttons on each side of the shorts.  A pair of loops inside the waistband clip to the short liners (to avoid sagging?) I purchased a medium size for an approx. 35"" waist and only a minor adjustment to the waistband was needed.  Edit:  Check the other reviews for sizing advice.  Some say the shorts run a bit large.The padded liner portion of the shorts are definitely the highlight of the product and I suggest you check out those independent reviews (search Pearl Izumi Men's Liner Short).  The existing user reviews on the liners are very clear and constructive.  I will be purchasing more of the liners in the near future - they work well with other shorts."

These are toning shoes and it says right on the box that they are not to be worn during exercise other than walking. They feel very stable and supportive, so they're not like those rocking toning shoes that I'd probably sprain my ankle with in 5 minutes. They're cushy, almost bouncey - exceptionally comfortable. In fact, I love these shoes so much, I ordered a pair of the same ones in brown. I wear them to work with my dress slacks and no one even notices. I guess if you're one of those people who's fussy about having the latest fashion statement on your feet, you wouldn't wear these to the office, but at 5 p.m. my feet still feel great and I don't hobble to the car like everyone in their stilettos.

These DV boots in Loden are a great, affordable alternative - the color is a vaguely greenish light brown that looks great with black, grey, tan, brown, forest green - it's a nice neutral I think will wear well next fall and looks great in the depths of winter, too.

2013-07-18,I595321642,5.0,I am loving this shirt...AND the seller too!,"[['Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Women', 'Clothing', 'Tops & Tees', 'Blouses & Button-Down Shirts']]",This is my first time buying a Patty product and I have to say that I am in love. The shirt itself is so flattering and classy. Perfect for a night out on the town or a casual get together. I wasn't sure how it would look since I have a bit of a pregnancy pooch but this shirt worked. I'm 5'2 and I have a big bust yet this shirt did wonders for me. I would definitely recommend this to all my friends. I am also very happy with the shipping. It was wicked fast! I got it two weeks earlier than the expected delivery time. Thank god for Patty!

It's not too heavy and has a really nice drape.  Meaning it doesn't hang up on my behind!  Lol

The setting is beautiful and the stones are fantastic. I bought it to wear when I don't wear my real diamond rings, i.e., vacations, but I will probably wear this all the time, it is just too beautiful to keep in a drawer."
2012-12-31,I940981475,5.0,warm and cozy,"[['Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Men', 'Accessories', 'Hats & Caps', 'Balaclavas']]",It is warm and fits great under my helmet.  Like other reviewers I have to admit that it fogs up glasses/goggles. But I was riding in the snow at about 25 degrees F.
2014-05-12,I000350237,4.0,Nice shirt,"[['Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Women', 'Clothing', 'Tops & Tees', 'Polos'], ['Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Women', 'Juniors', 'Tops & Tees', 'Polos']]",It is a nice shirt and it hangs down long enough.  I am a 14-16 size but should have gotten the ex-large because I personally do not like the snug feel.  The large works well which is why I stated fit as expected.

So i cant say how this would hold up for a heavy wedding dress BUT i think it would probably be ok.  Its really a good quality and came packaged nicely. The hoops are adjustable and i like how the waist is a slip/pull tie. Im 5'3 and hits the floor just right and if you want to wear it higher on your waist you can because of the adjustable pull tie waist.  I would recommend this product
2013-07-15,I296490222,5.0,A gift,"[['Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Women', 'Accessories', 'Scarves & Wraps', 'Fashion Scarves']]",The color in this scarf is far more brilliant than the picture conveys. I bought this as a gift and the recipient was pleased.
