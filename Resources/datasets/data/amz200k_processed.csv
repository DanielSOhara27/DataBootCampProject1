Material is a little thinner (and slightly see-through) than I would like, but the fit is very flattering. I'm 5'2&#34; and 115 pounds and the small fit pretty much just right - maybe a little snug. The style is a perfect retro feel!"

While it is true to the color shows dirt a little more than a darker color would, i really like the color combination. It's got lots of convenient little pockets, and is extremely warm!"

The fabric is of good quality and it's a little stretchy to help you get it on. This dress is NOT for busty gals. Trust me, there isn't much &#34;breathing&#34; room in the bodice area. I liked it for the price. It was cute."

He used one with money clip on the outside before and it was causing a hole in his back pants pockets so it was time for a change! He LOVES this wallet because he can take the whole thing or just the small part with his ID, his credit card and a little cash."

Indigo Affection 3 Medium (99%cotton,made in China) - It fits more like jeans. Im comparing it to Abercrombie & Fitch's SuperSkinny (size 0 short). I like this  better than the A&F because the back pockets on these Levi's is located higher than A&F which in result makes my butt look more lifted. I don't recommend order the colored version though because the fit is very different. Indigo Sky 26 Medium (88%cotton I believe)-This one fits more like legging with very thin material. I got a 3 Short instead of Medium not sure if it is mistake or the way it should be but it fits good. I might keep it. White Superstretch, 3/26 M - It fits more like jeans (98%cotton made in Pakistan) but really long. Compared to the other Indigo Affection 3M this is more like a half size smaller and much longer. I'll have to alter the white one if I decide to keep it. Still thinking..."

I ended up returning these because they did not fit me the same as the short boots. Not comfortable on the foot and not as tall as I would have liked - they hit me in an odd spot on my calf. I am tall (5'8"") so maybe that was an issue."

My only complaint is that the cat doesn't always face forward because of how it is put on the necklace. I might have to make a change to it, but it was a great price so it's not a big deal."

Iam very partial to the color blue.  I think the color blue goes with just about any other color.  He did describe to me the athletic stripe and that he wanted an elastic waist and side pockets, so that was a BIG help to me, to make sure that what I ordered for him would be the right kind of pants.My dad has lost quite a bit of weight over the last year, not intentional, he doesn't need to, so he needed pants that were not only lightweight, but also with an elastic waist with pockets.After he received them he told me that they were very easy to wash and quick to dry.  He also told me that they fit perfectly.  All of that made me so happy that my dad really liked these pants as I had no previous experience with this brand.I wish I could find this brand and style in his size, medium, but in another color, so I could send them to him.  Hopefully I will be able to at some point.A wonderful purchase for my dad!!"

These are very warm and comfortable.  They are definitely best as outdoor socks.  My husband complained about his feet sweating after wearing them around the office.

That length is decent for me for long skirts, but knee-length skirts, I'd probably go with a 20 inch length for people around my height."

They held up well, but are looking drab and worn out.  So I got these and was surprised to find they are just as good of a quality as the old pair.  I have become so used to companies going to lower quality materials in the past few years, but these were still very nice.  My only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is the stitching seemed to be a bit off/uneven on the waistline - like they got past quality control and maybe should have been marked as irregular."

You can wear is as a masque, hood, or clava.  If you simply want to keep the back of your neck  and head warm you'd set it up as a hood, whereas if the temperatures dip low you can wear it as a full-faced clava, with only your eyes showing.  If you run, walk, ski, or are in the outdoors for any extended period of time, a balaclava is a more than welcome piece of apparel.  No futzing with a scarf to keep your mouth and nose warm and you can easily put a hat over the top.The Seirus is quite reasonably priced and the fleece is of a nice, soft quality.  Make sure before you order that your get the proper sizing.  They come in three sizes that range from XS for young children to L/XL for adults.  If you are worried about any sort of smell, it's best to wash the balaclava prior to wearing it.  The fabric is Polartec and in order to preserve the Durable Water Repellant (DWR), the last thing you need to do is throw this in the washing machine using your normal detergent.  Probably the best thing to do is if you want to wash it, do so by hand using a little bit of blue Dawn dish detergent.  For the money, the Seirus Innovation Balaclava is an excellent choice, especially if you want to be comfortable and warm."

The Bare Access 2 feel perfect for these longer runs and leave my feet feeling much happier than if i tried these runs in the more minimal shoes i usually use...  I have tried Altra The One (too clumpy!)  as well as Inov-233s (too narrow toebox) for long runs but the Bare Access 2 feel much better than either of those two."

You can dress it up or down depending on your outfit. You can also tie a scarf or string beads around the crown. Possibilities are many. It can be worn several different ways due to the flexible brim. Great sun protection. Best of all you are carrying around your own shade when you wear it. Love it.

The best part is the thin straps and sexier appearance than most large bras. I have gained quite a bit of weight since having my last child and have thus found these to not be as comfortable for me anymore. The top of the underwire digs into my underarms and hurts. If you have a large cup size and a small frame with not very much side tissue, then this would be the perfect bra. Having a large frame (unfortunately) and a large cup size, I find the Elomi bra to be a better fit. Panache makes absolutely beatiful bras, though. Also, in terms of construction, I don't think these are quite as sturdy or well made as Elomi."

I tried some - both barefoot and with toesocks - at a local store that thinks everything they have is made of gold, then reluctantly ordered them online, having not seen this gray/bright yellow/green version that I bought, in person. As soon as they got on my feet, I realized I was delighted with their zany but relatively subdued looks.I had gone into that store looking to replace my current running shoes (which I did) but when I saw these things I knew I had to have some, especially when I discovered that they made my feet so happy.I don't recommend buying these online if there is any way you can get around it. For one thing, each flavor of these Vibram FiveFingers professes a different fit. I found an excellent chart for that on the Campmor website. But in addition, you need to know that each pair can vary. With a shoe that has this kind of fit (as with any shoe, really), it doesn't take much variation in material or stitching or lamination process to produce a &#34;hot spot&#34;. In my case I'm dealing with bunions that are static at this time but which must be babied in order to keep them static. That's the reason I buy the LS or laced version which is easier to adjust. I tie a square knot in the laces above the first or second lace hole on most lace shoes, to keep that area from tightening too much when I pull them tight enough to make the arch and ankle areas happy.At any rate, this pair fit differently than the ones in the full-price store. Luckily I was able to make needed adjustments because return is a bummer. Again, I advise buying only what you can try on, especially for this shoe.I personally am not going to run in these. I ran for years but realized my brother was right when he declared that &#34;anyone over 50 who runs is asking for hip replacement&#34;. That's even true for people who don't carry extra weight. Nope, not gonna run but oh how I love that barefoot feeling all day around the house and yard. I might wear these on my daily hike but like them too much to subject them to the inevitable wear on pavement. Plus they're just too cute for words and appeal to my sense of quirkiness.Comment Comment | Permalink"

My teenage daughter thinks the watch is super cute and wanted to wear it immediately.  I think it is cute, but will only wear it for casual events.3 stars because of the plastic.Edit: This watch comes in a variety of colors, and, in my opinion, the wilder colors are more fitting to this watch style."

They did fit well, right out of the bag, but started shrinking, the first time I washed them. The white one, in particular, has shrunk in the arms to where they go half-way up my forearms. The others haven't shrunk as much, but are very snug right now, and I can't imagine how much longer I'll be able to wear them. I've only had them about 6 weeks. Incidentally, I came back to Amazon today, and searched for ""ComfortSoft"" long sleeve tees.  I found some, from a different supplier, but there was a note at the top of the screen that I had ordered these previously.  When I put some in my cart, and went to check out, they had surprisingly changed from ""ComfortSoft"", to ""Tagless"", so I deleted them.  I guess I'll have to find them somewhere else.  I am VERY disappointed in Hanes right now."

I'm a weebit OCPD and I obsess over time. Wearing a digital watch synced up with my computer time exactly is a comfort to me. I've worn a watch since I was 7 and my husband can attest he has never seen me without my trusty digital wrist watch.2. I abuse my watches. I sleep, eat, drink, shower, run, swim, go to the beach, etc with my watches. All my watches end up with scratched surfaces. An unlucky few had their faces broken into. A lot of my watchbands couldn't stand the abuse and committed suicide.3. I lose/break watches like it's my job. By the time I was 22, I have gone through 13 watches. The fastest record of me losing or breaking a watch was 1 hour. No watch has ever lived more than 2 years on my wrist...until now.Now, here's the review:My coworker told me Ironman watches are indestructible, so I had to give it a try. When my watch inevitably died, I gave T5D601 a try. Well, that was a good watch, but the watch band design was flawed. Where the watch band connects to the watch was glued on, and it eventually failed. The watch lasted a year. When my watches die, I normally go into panic mode and head straight to a store where I think they might sell watches to buy a replacement watch. This time, I dragged my poor husband (then boyfriend) who was on a date with me at the time to a store to buy my trusty Ironman watch against his will. I NEEDED it! Life was not complete without my watch! I wasn't going to buy another watch where the watch band was glued on, so after some debating I ended up with this model. It looked sturdy and indestructible. It looked like it might last. I was right.That was four years ago. This is the only watch I've ever had that lasted over two years. It's still alive. Two years ago the pink face plate fell off. I superglued it back on and it has never been a problem since. The pink color is painted on, and a lot of it peeled off over time. Fortunately the plastic underneath has also been dyed a pink color, so it's not obvious that the paint peeled off. The face has six scratches, two of them deep, but the watch is still functional. The band shows no sign of deterioration except for the horrendous scratch marks I caused, which is remarkable.Function:In terms of function, it has three alarms, the normal stuff, I wish it has a count down, but it doesn't. Any function you don't need you can hide. I run, but since I have a Garmin 305, I never used the lap function on this watch. It allows you to set two time zones, and all you have to do is to long press the start button to change time zone permanently. If you want to just see what the other place's time is, just press start button and not hold it down. This function comes in handy for me. I actually use it for daylight savings time.This watch has been to hell and back with me and it is still alive. Four years is an amazing record for me. IMO, it's not the prettiest looking watch out there. My husband tried to buy me a Citizen Eco-Drive to get me away from this hideous watch (his opinion) but I would have none of it. It may not be dressy or beautiful, but it is dependable and it does not fail, which, for me, is more important than anything else."

Even the bands are specially made to be tougher than normal (which is why I've never broken one, a rarity for me if not a miracle), the huge (and kind of ugly) rubber-over-metal bumper keeps the face from getting scratched which is good for me as well. This is also a solar powered watch, and my last one is still going strong after more than 4 years, so I can safely say battery life is excellent.

349,"10 17, 2008",I915199069,5.0,Review by William's Wife Jen,"[['Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Women', 'Clothing', 'Lingerie, Sleep & Lounge', 'Intimates', 'Shapewear', 'Waist Cinchers']]","I have several corsets and waist cinchers and I have to say that this one is my favourite. I have worn it almost daily since I bought it, and I couldn't be more pleased. Allow me to explain why this is the cincher to buy.1)The difference between corsets and cinchers: I own both, and they both do different things even though most people think that they're the same. A corset makes the body look beautiful outside of clothes (they push the breasts up very high and pull in the waist), but in general (unless you're wearing Marie Antoinette style clothing) they don't look good under an outfit. The breasts become a single lump and the ties are usually quite visiable underneath (which defeats the entire purpose of trying to get people to think that this is your natural figure). A cincher is made to be worn under clothes, to pull in the waist, and to be as invisiable as possible. Therefore they often aren't as pretty as corsets but make much better undergarments.2) Rago rocks! I own many shaper garments, and Rago's are by far the best. Yes, you can find cheaper brands in the department stores, but they won't hold up as well and they won't have the power that Rago's have.3)Of the versions Rago offers on this site, this one is the best. I own the other model which is very similar except that it is lace and has garters, but it doesn't offer as much support as this one and aren't as invisiable as this one. The satin feels wonderful next to the skin and even under clingy dresses this is just about undetectable. Unless you have your heart set on garters, this is the cincher to buy.4) The fit: like many women I suffer from ""Mummy Tummy"", the horrible price one must pay for having grown two human beings in her body. I am in very good shape, but nothing gets those muscles back to their prepregnancy shape besides surgery (I don't have a spare $20,000 lying around and the scar is huge and ugly). This garment instantly takes 2-4 inches off of the waist and allows one to wear fashionable clothes again without looking frumpy or silly. Another bonus is that I stood about two inches taller because it forces you to walk and sit with perfect posture. This gave me back my youthful waistline. One reviewer said that the fit is a bit tight and they run small; the fit is much tighter than what lace materials and cheaper brands offer but that's because it's a high quality product that works! Those satin panels really pull you in, but they're not uncomfortable (I felt like a sausage for the first hour I wore it, but the body heat warms it up and makes it softer without losing any control). I plan on losing about 10-20 lbs. over the next few months so I will probably buy a new one soon, but I'd recommend buying your size according to the chart. Most of the time I can fit into a small because they don't provide as much compression, but this one you need to be exact.Anyway, if you are looking for an awesome waist cincher that is affordable, flattens your stomach and gives you a lovely ""wasp's waist"", and feels wonderful and comfortable next to the skin, this is the one to buy."

He generally wears 4T pants and shorts though the waists can be too big, and the waists of 4T pajamas are always too big, but for some reason underwear brands seem to run small and cut into his waist.I already had one pack of these and they fit him well and I liked the soft waistband, but I still wanted to find a less expensive brand.  Eventually it was costing me more money to keep buying underwear that did not end up fitting, so I ordered another pack of these in 4T.  Overall I am happy but each short in the pack is has a different waist size and one is much smaller than the others.  I hope they will stretch out to the right size with time."

My mother warned me, ""Don't buy Playtex!"", because she felt they came up too high under the arms with excess fabric and that their cups fit weirdly compared to other brands in the same size. But I bought this anyway, mostly because it was half the cost of my fave brand, Glamorise. Boy, did I make a mistake!Okay, I will say that this covers and holds the bo*bs up just fine. Almost too well- it reminds me of that ""Lunch Lady Song"" Adam Sandler sang on SNL years ago, about a lady who has 76 hooks in her big old bra or something like that. That's how I felt while wearing this! Granted, I'm a big woman but my chest isn't sagging that much (yet) and I don't need the ""duct tape holding method"" that this bra feels like. I wear a 48F and this bra just didn't feel right to me. Not tight or with any spillover...just icky. As my mother warned, there is indeed too much fabric on the sides of the bra under the arm. Maybe women with a lot of fat in that area like this extra fabric, but that's actually one of my lean spots (genetics and years of weight-training to thank), so all it does is rub against my upper arms and underarms (which feels awful, too).The fabric is also SO scratchy! Really uncomfortable on my skin all day long. I always hand-wash my bras/panties alone, rinse well and then let them drip dry. My delicates last for years this way. And I have never had a bra with fabric that felt so rough! This bra pilled along the edges, too, which doesn't happen to any other bra that I have (mostly because I hand-wash and drip-dry, I'm sure). Forget 18 hours- after 6 hours, I couldn't wait to tear this scratchy bra off!The straps are just too thick for me. Unless you're wearing a crewneck, these may peek out of your shirts because there's so much to the straps and cups. The bra comes up high on the chest, too, which is fine if concealing your breasts is your goal. But for those who wear ballet-neck, v-neck or sweetheart necklines, this bra comes up too high on the chest and the straps are too wide.I praise Amazon for carrying many bras for plus-sized women like me. I just don't care for this bra and will purchase Glamorise (despite the extra cost) because I've learned my lesson. I DID try another kind of Playtex bra and didn't like it, either (similar problems)."

I pull them up just below my elbows, which works for the outfit. It is still fitted, but it is very flattering to my more ruler like figure. Not too tight across the chest, the flare cut works well, and ignoring the sleeves, works very well with jeans. It is a tad too short to try with leggings or tights for me; but I am quite tall, so that was expected. If you are petite, this is going to be a shirt you are going to love. If you are small giantess like myself, realize that this is not going to be long enough to wear with leggings, unless you have a short torso.

With daily use, I'm having to buy a new pair every month- either the sole gets holes in it, or the top of the shoes rips/stretches so it doesn't fit anymore. Nothing has changed about the conditions or usage (same pool, same garden surface, same amount of wear) but apparently the quality of these shoes has gone REALLY downhill. They just aren't as durable. But they are comfy and they protect my feet, so I keep buying them- I haven't found a shoe that fits as great.The other issue, and this has always been a problem- the innersole of the shoe slips. It's firmly in place when the show arrives, but after a few wears it pulls up from the bottom of the shoe and ""floats around"" as you walk/swim/etc. It's a pain in the neck.

Beads of perspiration formed  beneath the silicone inserts, dripping down and tickling to distraction as they pooled in my bra cup. They were also visible past the edges of my bra so I had to be very careful not to wear anything that was cut too low thus revealing my secret. They are also too wide for my 34"" chest, making me look like I'm flat and fatty in the upper body instead of well endowed. I weigh 110# and am 5'2""--but it doesn't take much to make a short person like me look like I gained 5 lbs with this spread out bust bulk. It is too thick on the lateral edges of the chest instead of being fuller in the middle which is what I was hoping for. I am a cross between a 34 A and B and need something to fill in my bra a bit better, but this really only fills out the sides and is too wide all around,extending past the bra edges and just makes me look like I have a flat fatty chest. I am about to order a wedge silicone style that has a push up effect according to the reviews with the hope that it will be cooler and tolerable for the summer because it has a smaller surface area, and that it will give me a perkier look with fuller shape in the middle of the cup.

I can't think of how many bras (normal and exercise) that's I've bought and thrown out over the years. Even harder to factor in a preferred zip up front.This Yvette bra is soft, comfortable, yet breathable. At first I was worried that while running at 7+ MPH that my chest would be all over the place, yet everything stayed perfectly in place. Not too tight, not too loose. My skin could breath and sweat but straps stayed out and didn't shift even after an hour of hard running. This is an affordable yet high quality product for yoga, Pilates, aerobics, and cycling.

I'm already putting his 20 month old son in speedos, and so I think the combo of that, the colors and pattern was a tad to much for him (and he isn't a machismo either...he wears skinny jeans and tight t shirts for example).  Needless to say, we switched it out for the darker blue one (thanks Amazon). Soo there's that.The fit seems right.  For my 20 month old who is about 22 lbs, I got the 24 month size.  I think the legs are right enough, although we shall see when a #2 happens (I will update).  My son is quite skinny though, so I would advise most who have this age to go with the 24 months because I think it will be tight but not too right (you know your kid though, and if he is 98% for weight, then size the kid up).We used an iplay diaper last year (white with buttons on the side), and it was great - but we never experienced a poo, so I don't know if it would have held (but I think it would have bc the legs were tight and every reviewer said it would)."

I found another pair of New Balance shoes that has a similar tread pattern and compared the two.  When held together, the new shoe was 3/4&#34; to 1&#34; shorter than its counterpart.  This is either a change in manufacturing or an inattention to detail.  From what the other reviews have said, it would appear to be less of a variance in each shoe than an overall reduction of sizing.  Be careful what you order from New Balance.

The Cleo sub-brand is often said to run small in the band, big in the cup, I haven't found this to be true (especially with this particular bra).  I bought this bra in my regular band and cup size and while the band is fine, I can't tell whether perhaps an H cup would have been a better bet, or if it's meant to be a minimizer.

It took me $15 to tailor it, and guess what....dang it looks good!  The fabric is average with good seams, and the style is prime!  Only cheap part is the button chain, it's really cheap.  But lucky for me/us we have Amazon!  So I'm looking for a better quality button chain.  Since I can't tell anymore what fit I'm going to get from TheLees and I had to spend $$ to get it tailored, I docked it two stars.  I do love the style though, just wish the QC at TheLees was better.  I DO recommend this vest to my family and friends...for they all are bigger than me, they shouldn't have a problem."

In this bra I'm a 34F (it runs a cup size large so order a cup size down), and it's very hard to find supportive bras that are durable, comfortable, and that hold the ladies up without looking ridiculous. This bra holds my breasts up where they belong, looks seamless under any shirt, and fits perfectly around my rib cage and under my arms. My husband commented that I've never looked better wearing a bra, which I think is a testament in itself. My ONLY complaint is that the material used for the straps makes them loosen easier than other bras I've owned, but it's as simple as tightening the straps every few days before I put on the bra. I'd recommend this to any ladies wanting a supportive bra that holds up :-)"

As soon as I put this bra on, I knew it wasn't going back!  I didn't have one nursing bra that truly fit, and now that I do, it's hard to put any of the others on anymore.  I ended up going to the Hotmilk website and ordering 2 more since this is the only style that Amazon carries (wish they carried more!).  The bra is really well made, very comfortable, and most importantly, supportive without underwire!  I would not have thought it was possible for a FF-cup bra to be so supportive without underwire.  It's amazing.  My one small issue with the bra is that the cup fabric is a bit more revealing than I would like it to be (nursing pads may show when you're wearing them).  However, I still give this five stars because all of the good things about it more than outweigh that small issue."

This hat definitely has some room for his head to grow but still fits well enough where it's not falling off.

In fact, I use running to get over my sore calves or quads from strength training when I get too ambitious.I wear these mostly without socks, but it doesn't bother me to wear them with thin socks when it's cold outside.  And, because there's no toe thing to contend with, that is an option - unlike other minimalist shoes.I have talked my husband into getting the men's version of these shoes to help with his aching/weak calves and knee pain.  I will by another pair of these whenever my shoes wear out.  They show no signs of wear on the outside - so that may be awhile."

The watch does look exactly like the picture, or at least mine does. I have read reviews others have written saying it didn't look like the picture or that it looks like something from the dollar store- that I don't agree with. The band is too big for my wrist (I'd say I have normal size wrists) so I will probably have one link removed and then it should fit perfectly. The only part about this watch that feels cheap to me is the band itself. It is heavier than plastic would be but the way it feels when you're holding it- you can feel that it's cheaply made. Wearing it on my wrist, however, I think it looks nice and I think people would think it was a $200 watch. I am going to put clear nailpolish over the rhinestones and on the inside of the band as I have read other reviews saying the band may turn your skin green and some have complained that rhinestones fell out shortly after they bought it.All in all, decent watch- especially for the $8 I paid for it. Looks MUCH more expensive than $8, that is undeniable. I am looking forward to rocking this watch and shocking people when I tell them how inexpensive it was."

I decided to go with large, Extra large Based on another customers review. This size fits Perfect on my 5'2 140 pd Body frame. The hemline comes down to my ankles which fits my style. The first color I bought was purple two weeks later I ordered the wine color and I'm hoping to get the green color next. There is only one thing that could make me happier with this dress and that is if it had deep side pockets so for those long walks on the beach I would'nt need to carry a purse for my cell phone & keys. So if the company is listening how about some nice side pockets & a free dress for the Suggestion? I have a Similar Dress from another company and the side pockets make the dress."
1061,"02 19, 2010",I736584409,5.0,Casio Men's Atomic Solar G Shock GWM850-1CR; Solid Watch,"[['Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'New Arrivals'], ['Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Men', 'Watches', 'Wrist Watches']]","I just received this watch and have been using it daily. The packaging was excellent, the shipping time was longer than expected due to the inclement weather back East.My present Casio, the JC-30 has been in service for several years and is finally showing wear and tear. I hope this new Casio watch lasts as many years as the JC-30.The GWM850-1CR is a sleeker Casio G Shock model than many of the other Casio G Shocks on the market today. It is not as extreme in the height, width and overall size of the watch. It has a sleek and solid appearence and will not stand out on the wrist.The bezel is made of a clean, smooth appearing stainless steel and will also provide damage protection from everyday use.The face of the watch is a light shade of gray, with black colored data such as the day, date and time. The face of the watch has a clean and uncluttered appearance with the top window displaying the day and the date. The day and the date is hard to read, the letters and digits are very small. Unless you have excellent eye sight or glasses, this could be a slight problem. This is the only complaint I have about this watch. The top window also displays world time when this feature is activated.The bottom window displays the horizional battery charge, the solar battery strength, snooze, alarm, sig alerts, solar cell and the time. The numbers are easy to read and the bottom window is well designed.Directly above the watch data is a textured dark gray colored front with two windows that is both functional and gives the watch a better appearance and quality than you would expect from a watch at this price point.The four buttons A,B,C,D are well placed and have a slight elevated protective perimeter from the body of the watch so the buttons can not be pressed inadvertently. It takes a bit of pressure to activate the button. Button L, located at the botton center of the watch will provide back light to the watch in low light conditions. The back light is adequate, but not really bright.The wrist band is made of a textured resin material with duel clasps. The wrist band appears to be molded or structured around the watch and it gives a good looking appearance. I'm hoping that the wrist band is made of a strong and long lasting resin. It is not known how difficult it will be to replace the wrist band when it wears out.This watch has many features, such as atomic time keeping, solar power, standard or military time format,(12/24) world time, stop watch, count down timer, rally feature, multiple alarms, snooze, hour beeper and auto (EL) back light. The audible alerts are not loud, rather the sound is soft and muted. The watch also has a automatic power saver shutdown in darkness. This feature saves power during non-operation.The watch also comes with an impressive 119 page manual that provides detailed information about the watch features, functions and how to operate the watch.Unless you are a rocket scientist or a brain surgeon, it will take a little time and a little effort to understand the methods and procedures to operate all the features:)Pros: Solar powered, atomic timekeeping, sleek smooth appearing stainless steel bezel and packed with many features. Great watch at price point and well worth the price.Cons: The top window that displays the font/lettering/numbers for the day and date are small to read.Conclusion: All in all, this is a well designed watch with a standard size and sleeker design. Also, it is a great watch for the price point.Update: As of March, 2014, I have owned this watch for over four years and it has performed perfectly.I wear it everyday and the watch takes significant use and impacts in the work environment. Due to the great construction materials, the watch and the resin wrist band have held up extremely well. There have been no defects in construction materials and the performance of the watch.I'm very pleased with the quality and features of this watch.Jon Green"

As an avid walker and hiker, even in the dead of winter I am always looking for something a little warmer and more comfortable with the least amount of effort to put on, or carry along.  For years there was the traditional knit hat, or toque that was on my list as standard equipment both for walking and hiking.  That is until I tried one of these on at the mall this past holiday season and decided that they have easily incorporated into the design of these the 3 essentials necessary for keeping warm and comfy while braving the winters savage elements.  A knit toque for the head, an extended ear flap to take care of the ears, and a visor for the very obvious reasons as to why we very often need one.  Quite simply put, I found these hats to be far more warm and comfy than the traditional toque for surviving the long winter here in New England.  Most of all, I wish that I had located the hats here before buying a couple at the local mall.  They are not only cheaper here than what I paid, but as of the time of this writing, ship for free through Amazon.  If you spend a lot of time outside in winter and desire the ultimate in head gear as far as warmth and convenience in my opinion, invest in two or more of these and be done for life.  They are warm, comfy, and at the price they are asking for them with free shipping, its like you are buying them tax free and at cost from your local store, and having them delivered to your house for free...

I used a wire brush to soften up the spots and it helped to resurface the original material, but not 100%.  it is fairly subtle, and I am sure if I don't like it in the future, I can take it to a shoe shop for a really inexpensive touch-up.My shoe size is normally anywhere from 8 - 9 depending on the type of shoe- with boots I usually order a 9 because I can wear a heavy sock.

You never know whether it is going to be 75 degrees or 30 degrees on Christmas Day from year to year. I was glad to finally have found a lighter Christmas shirt for him for some of those 75 degree Christmases.The artwork on the shirt is exactly like the picture.

These pants are cut to both enhance the shape of the female frame, (the seams are very well placed and do not chafe or bulge), and allow just the right amount of stretch, and support, to hold up during long activities requiring a lot of leg movement.

I have owned it in black for over a year, and am buying the Khaki for spring/summer. It simply for me is the most functional everyday work/commuter bag I have found. I'm an urban commuter, walk to the train and around the city everyday. The drop is perfect (no struggling to get it on my shoulder over a winter coat, or having to hang on tight to stop it from sliding down my arm, no strangling myself with a clunky cross body strap with a heavy bag flopping around on my hip), it sits easily on my shoulder,comfortably under my arm, is easy to get on and off. The three big outer pockets are perfect to slip in an umbrella (always need to have one with me),sunglasses,water bottle,newspaper, gloves,Ipod, pair of flats or anything else I might need . The bag has a nice wide zippered opening, no struggling to get into the bag to grab my wallet,then digging into the abyss groping for it.The slide and zipper pockets inside, keep my keys, phone, wallet etc. securely in the same spot everday where I can find them, no fumbling with sticky zippers on oddly placed pockets to grab my phone or find my makeup bag. Roomy enough to get everything else I need in it without feeling like a suitcase.(My Kindle and Tablet PC fit easily, my 14"" laptop is a tight fit-I rarely carry it.).Love the feet on the bottom, the bag stands and keeps its shape when I put it down. The outside double zipper pocket will hold any files I need with me, or unzipped, will slide over my carryon handle when traveling. I am really hard on my bags, I also walk in rain and snow and it has held up well, including the rolled handles (haven't had the same trouble as some other reviewers have had with the straps.) I too wish Baggallini would update it's color choices (especially the lining colors. I'm not sure how I'm going to like the ""Caspian Blue"" lining that comes in the Khaki-a really odd choice in my opinion),but I'm willing to deal with it because this bag just works for me. It's not the most fashionable bag I own,but it is classic and professional enough for me to feel comfortable carrying into a business meeting."

The color is pretty. It's more salmon than true pink and the pattern is printed well. The hem is really the only problem and its a big one. It's hemmed in white thread and there is no white on the scarf at all. The thread is cheap and thick and the stitches are about a quarter inch long. Some places in the scarf aren't hemmed at all. I'm not sending it back. I'm just going to sit down with transparent thread and rehem the whole thing.

It is a very different look.I'm still trying to decide whether of not to return the boots.  They are very lightweight, appears to be well constructed, fit well, and all in all are attractive enough.
