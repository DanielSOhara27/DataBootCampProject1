2013-02-18,B001BUPF62,5.0,The Complete Wizard of Oz Collection,A2L68JR6FK0N3T,"I enjoyed reading this complete series of Wizard of OZ. Some books I had read before, but this is the first time I am able to read a complete set of books in order. Some books are new to me. I am currently reading this complete set."
2013-08-10,B001V9K7WU,2.0,Wow... 2 out of 5 stars,A36TJGWT8N9G8V,"David, what happened to you?  The first book was almost a home run.  The second sounds like you had to rush it out the door and ran out of steam?  Everything towards the end was rushed.  The whole story and plot went no where until the last maybe 1/5 of the book, and even then it was rushed.  And just like that... it ends?Wow... maybe drop the price for people that want to read it as fans of the first book, but I don't feel there's much justice with this book.2 out of 5 stars, because it sounds like a sweat shop ghost written book."
2014-01-21,B001VNCPJY,5.0,Surprisingly good...,A1ZVKDV3ILNS47,"The synopsis for this book is just enough to pique your interest.  The storyline is easy to follow, the characters are like old friends.  But enough is left unsaid to allow you to speculate and build more of the story on your own outside of the book."
2012-04-28,B002E7ARKK,2.0,Much too rushed,AKUTRELUQNV42,"This story was a great idea. I started it and was interested in how the author would work out the communication between a werewolf and a deaf human. I didn't get much out of it, to be honest. I got into it, was enjoying myself very much reading, and then the main characters met (a ""helpless"" woman meeting two huge strangers in the middle of nowhere at night) and they got cuddly that very first night. Really? And the very next morning, they reveal that not only are they werewolves, she is one too! And she thinks it's really cool. Okay, fine, I can admit that if someone told me I was a werewolf, I'd be ecstatic.But then they can't have sex. Then they HAVE to have sex. Then they're in mortal danger, and in a blink all of a sudden the helpless deaf former-human is ordering around a pack hell bent on tearing them apart. What? And all this in how many words? This could have been stretched out and developed into an amazing full-length novel. It just seems all too neat in the end. Everything that was such a huge obstacle just magically turned out to be nothing but a speed bump and the heroine just wakes up one day, her world turned upside down and she's all peachy, going along with the program like it's the most natural thing. Yeah, I don't think so.Oh and the deaf thing? Wouldn't you know it? They can speak telepathically! Isn't that convenient?"
2011-11-17,B002FK3U00,5.0,"Another Ravenous, Zealous, Tale from the Astounding Lorelei James!!",A1LEF4345ASIPD,"Willow Gregory woke up in Blake West's bed with absolutely no recollection of what transpired the night before.

For those luscious curves, able breast, & squeezable bottom have been beckoning him in.It's going to be ultimately impossible to be within the proximity of her for the duration of the penalty that has been bestowed upon her, for wrecking his best friend's bar. Because there's no doubt in his mind that Willow won't be his. He just needs to strategize his next move.Well it's unfathomable to Willow that she would lose complete and utter control of her anger & drinking ability to destroy something that didn't belong to her.

2013-03-10,B002UKOWM0,2.0,Agree with other review,A26OMZXFG7O62L,"I read this book last week but did not leave a review at the time.  I really liked the premise of it and tried hard to like the book.  However, I couldn't keep track of the characters and they seemed to just appear from nowhere.  I felt I had missed a part earlier in the book where they were introduced and their story told.  I actually went back looking for it the first time it happened.  I decided to leave a review now because I just read a couple of other reviews that support my view.  The similarity of character names combined with missing pieces of the story left me tired and disappointed."
2014-07-1,B002WC99GU,4.0,I really liked the interactions between the three characters,A11IS3OQHGZHQY,"I really liked the interactions between the three characters, in some of the m&eacute;nage books I've read sometimes there's a third person who doesn't really fit (almost like an extra in the relationship) but this book didn't make me feel that way. I think Kelly was the perfect third for these guys and it was the dialogue that kept me the most interested. Overall a pretty good read."
2014-03-11,B002XOTPYI,4.0,If only....,A2609G2X4GKYRQ,"Lost and found love. WOW. I really enjoyed this book, even though it is short. I loved the idea that they both harbored feelings for each other in High School and now they can act on them. It was wonderful to see that they wanted to be a family and that it wasn't about just sex and living a unique lifestyle. I would read more of her work. The samples at the end have me intrigued to see if other works are as entertaining."
2010-04-10,B00318D5VE,4.0,Good but very long,AGFGY4EJ37VS2,"I enjoyed this book and its concept, but I did not like the length and some of the duller parts could have been omitted. Over all a great idea, and great characters. I especially loved Peregrin and Angelica. Some editing may have eliminated the lengthiness and made it a bit more readable, but a great start to what looks to me to be a great writer's career."
2014-06-30,B0031Y6TKW,5.0,Great story in need of editing,A210C3OP4AAK70,"I think this was a great book, generally well-written, but in need of a good editor. A well-crafted story that kept me coming back for more, it bothered me when words were missing or duplicated, or tenses were wrong. I appreciated that it was such a long book for free, so I didn't hesitate to pay for the second volume. As a writer, I appreciate the work, but recommend finding one or two prereaders who can catch the majority of those niggling issues. I look forward to book two."
2013-06-24,B0031Y9CPG,4.0,"Chloe, Chloe, Chloe",A34FGMJ3K5O6GT,"This was a good book, yes it was hot. Some say it lack character, hum, I say it didn't lack anything. It had a beginning, a middle and a conclusion, which spells a good story. To me some parts were funny, like Chloe's sister Zoe, talk about trouble, and what about the hunk Mark? Some people want more than what erotic is suppose to be, I like a short, hot and sweat story and it had it all. Anyway I have given it a 4 because I liked it."
2013-04-28,B0033Y95CE,3.0,"Hot, but hate the main female character",A2ZSH3DPVR6X4D,Tally just does not entertain me. I found her annoying and this decreased by enjoyment of the book. However the two males leads completely made up for it! If only they were real!
2011-02-20,B0034EJL90,3.0,Torn,A3B96D5MTAD9MF,"I was torn with this one.  I wanted to like it and at times i did, but as with the other reviewers it was disappointed in how Pip just rolled over after their past.  She deserved to be chased and have Cowboy beg her a little bit but i never felt like he deserved her instant forgiveness.  I really liked them both but i would like to have seen him do some serious apologizing and maybe some groveling as well.Overall, not bad but not great.  But for less than $3 I don't regret the purchase and am glad i have it to add to the other Men of SWAT collection."
2013-09-3,B0035LDNBY,4.0,Smokin' Hot,A3B51RBXIRUP80,"I LOVE Cameron Dane!  Her stories are great, and this one is no different.  The characters are likeable, the love scenes smokin' hot and I went from laughing to crying in this story, just like all the rest.The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I think her ebooks are a little pricey.  Other than that, it was a fantastic book in an outstanding series!"
2013-08-5,B0035N1UOY,4.0,kool story,AY8EWDWLZRY5I,Kool story Im hoping there will be a next book. Very unique story line. HOT sex and the mind games where killer.
2013-01-21,B00381B3ZY,5.0,"Stellar collection, well worth owning",AMMEOBGQ8T34J,"This is billed as ""thirteen creepy tales,"" but to be fair, they are not ALL creepy.  The last one, for example, is more of a life-affirming, oddly understated, and respectful piece of work.  All of the stories were tightly written, and once I picked up the book, I didn't put it down until the last word.  I love finding self-published authors who give indie work a good name--obviously, the author cared enough to edit and finish the book properly before publishing.  The stories were compelling, and I'm not going to give you any spoilers--you'll have to read for yourself! But I'm definitely going to keep an eye on this guy, because he currently ranks up there with some of my favorite indie authors."
2013-12-19,B0038KX8S0,5.0,Great,A19NV52QD8YCTV,"Loved it, it was great I couldn't put it down. I would highly recommend it. Such a wonderful love story"
2014-04-6,B0038KX8S0,2.0,Cute story but poor writing style,A1ZTIIU0V1KTFC,"I liked the premise, I even like how it ended, but I lost track of how many times they 'moaned' and 'groaned'; it was the only sound they made, sometimes 2-3 times in a paragraph! On top of this, everything was apparently 'lovely'. Essentially, the word repetition overrode the story on many occasions.Also, when a new person starts to speak, they should get a new paragraph. To have 2-3 people speaking in one paragraph, often without full stops, was very confusing.Then there was the head hopping! One voice at a time, please, and hopefully within different chapters, or if not, with double paragraph gaps between each. It gets confusing to have the point of view changed from one paragraph to another.Still, I did enjoy the storyline."
2014-06-25,B003AYEM66,3.0,Not bad,AD1E4MBIBUFUE,"This book wasn't bad, I would definitely read another book by this author, and with this character, it was a pretty decent mystery."
2013-08-27,B003C1R5CA,5.0,A mst read for all famillies,A2KOQG4SULOTS7,"Wow did this set me thinking, everyone  should read this book , we all seem to have elderly rellies & how dementia etc. was handled was a real eye oepner"
2011-02-6,B003FK5QAG,4.0,"charming, sexy, fun",ARDROUMXFQ2NS,"Just Right walked that hard to balance romance line of engaging characters, enough ''will they, won't they'' angst, and still deliever some steam. I've read enough free kindle romance books to REALLY appreciate an author that can deliver the goods and some nice humor. Dare I say it... I might even PAY for another book by this author?! Well, let's not get crazy. But, I would recommend Just Right to a romance fan with a thing for hot doctors, hot ''good parts'' and strong dialogue. I'd even recommend paying for it :-)"
2013-03-16,B003N2QTTS,4.0,Jake is my favorite brother,A3YIREZP208T4,I have loved getting to know the tracers brothers.  Each with a separate and interesting personality.  But it's the family bond I love the most!
2010-06-21,B003NX7C20,4.0,GREAT DEBUT,A380RZCQTDKSH7,"Allegra has cashed in her frequent flier miles to fly to Scotland and see what she's hoping is The Dedfield Rose, also known as The Flower of Death.  The information and request to come to Scotland came from Douglas MacGregor, owner of the pub Mac's.  The danger is increased when a local man is killed.  With all the threats Allegra has to face it's a good thing she has a guardian angel.  Casper, not his real name, was a warrior in a Germanic tribe that fought the Romans.  He died 1st or 2nd century AD.  In order to get into heaven he has to be a guardian angel AND abstain from sex.  This is his penance for the raping and pillaging he indulged in during his lifetime.  This translates into some serious sexual tension between Casper and Allegra.ALLEGRA FAIRWEATHER: PARANORMAL INVESTIGATOR is different and fun.  The story has excellent flow and reads very quickly.  I like Allegra's voice and sense of humor.  The mystery is good and trying to figure out what was coming next kept me on my toes.  One of the entities was kinda scary & not one I was really familiar with.  The relationship with Casper is very appealing.  I really appreciate the fact that they both put his entrance into heaven above their temporary carnal satisfaction.  It creates a tension and dynamic that has, in my opinion, an old fashioned romantic feel.  It would suit me if they never scratch that itch.  Their relationship has the opportunity to be something truly special and so much more that way.  The potential in Allegra's debut is promising and I eagerly look forward to her next investigation.I received this book from the publisher through netgalley"
2013-01-12,B003O85YEM,2.0,Just couldn't get into it!,ANR2VSAO7C5G6,Can't write much about this book as I just couldn't get into it.  Tried to go back several times but nothing about it caught my interest.
2014-06-24,B003PPDB12,4.0,good mystery,AQ6B3H6Z5IH2,A good book that keeps your attention throughout. Took a while to figure out how everything tied together.  Worth the read.
2013-08-13,B003QHZ5JU,5.0,Great Story,A2BSFP13NB91KS,Strange and wonderful. In some cases a word or two says it all. Am annoyed at having to write more. Tis the end.
2013-06-18,B003SE7K4O,3.0,"Not exceptional, but a good read",A1O6X2EGZQEKYK,"This is the third of Andrew Grey's novels that I have read.  Although it was a good story, definitely not the same caliber as his first book in the series.  A bit lacking in trying to spin a &#34;who done it&#34; mystery, but still enjoyable."
2012-01-8,B003U2RVDY,4.0,Know your worth,A1COBF34FM73LH,"I really enjoyed the story. It shows that although we may enjoy having the finer things in life there is nothing like having a peace of mind and being happy. Marci aha Dani shows that when leaves her rich husband and flee to the east coast after years of being abused. She takes on a a low paying job, moves in a low class neighborhood and falls in love with a bouncer.I enjoyed her strength and the way she allowed love to love her. Although its different from the gritty, urban tales that I read. I really enjoyed this story."
2013-12-1,B003U89RS0,5.0,Seriously faced paced full of humour.,A2PFCU5WLS5UIX,"Excellent blend of innocent brilliance, danger,romance and intrigue. Loved the quirky mind of Lexi and her wild assortment of brainiacs and brainy secret services men."
2011-03-30,B003XRE5LM,5.0,Cute and quirky!,A3IRDK3SGT60F9,"This was a short fun little horror story.  I got through it fast and enjoyed it thoroughly.  Basically it is man vs. monster tub.  It was well written, paced well, and peaked your curiosity.  It was well worth its price!"
2013-08-8,B003XRE5NA,5.0,Highlander 2,A3JW8HKQCSYCBC,"Since reading  this book, I have read the other 14 books in this series and found them all to be well worth the read."
2013-04-20,B003XVZB2U,4.0,Women of sin,A2OK24SNRJWBKG,"Very well written book, one that I will read again and again.  Praise God for writers like these to show us God's love thru others eyes."
2011-05-19,B003Z9K3GO,4.0,"A beautiful, heart-warming and cleverly written romance!",A29PZR73GSKBZT,"Such a sweet story - I thoroughly enjoyed this lovely book! No, it's not as angsty or perhaps as deep as Ms. Lane's other books (I am a huge fan!), but I just adore the way she writes - it's such a refreshing, funny, biting style, and Sebastian seemed such a perfect fit for her ""voice.""MILD SPOILERS:Sebastian is out, and with a vengeance, sporting rainbow t-shirts and entirely unapologetic about his sexual preferences. He lives in a world of perpetual academia, plans on starting work on his second PhD with his best friend Bella. But we learn that much about Sebastian, and Bella for that matter, is a cover for the pain in their lives they are both trying to escape. Sebastian's pain, without spoiling much, is a result of a less than loving family. Bella's is something different, because she is blessed with the ""perfect"" family - including a brother named Asa - the brother who ""bewitches"" Sebastian.Asa is reeling from a painful divorce, and has sole custody of his (adorable) 7 year old son, Jordan. In spite of his pain, however, Asa is ready to love again when he meets Sebastian (in a funny scene where a buck-naked Asa threatens Sebastian with a baseball bat, thinking he's a burgler!). He's had a single encounter with another man, and is open-minded and most definitely turned-on by the gorgeous Sebastian. One thing leads to another, but it's not the formerly straight Asa who runs away in fear...it's Sebastian. The main focus of the story is on Sebastian and Bella's growth, as we watch them work through their fears and ""grow up.""I agree with some of the other reviewers that the tension in the story was pretty predictable, but honestly didn't care. I didn't need a major trauma or angst to round out the plot. I also agree that Asa's character is a bit too good to be true, but I think part of this comes from the fact that, although the narrative is in the third-person, the story is most definitely told from Sebastian's persepctive, and Sebastian worships the ground Asa walks on. Of course Asa would seem perfect.Ms. Lane did a marvelous job with the character of Bella, giving her depth and her own story. A nice change of pace from the traditional dual protagonist focus of M/M romance. I laughed out loud more than a few times (my kids kept giving me strange looks!) as I read some of the scenes. The sex scenes were hot and there were plenty to satisfy me.This would be a perfect beach read, if you're looking for something clever and sweet - a story to keep you smiling, well after you've finished. I don't doubt I'll be re-reading this one, the next time I'm feeling like I need a warm fuzzy!Shira Anthony (a.k.a. Sarah Alexander)Author of ""From the Depths"""
2011-03-6,B00413PTT4,3.0,This book was okay,ASLBEPLSAPWX9,"This wasn't my favorite of the series, but it was okay. The author just seems to drag things out too long and spend countless pages on mundane, uninteresting things. She needs to focus more on the action and not show so much of everyday life. Use the *** and skip from time to time. The entire thing doesn't have to be step-by-step and linear. Also, the fact that she didn't use contractions half the time started to really annoy me in this book. The characters are also becoming less and less likable as the series goes on. I still want to know how the series ends, though."
2013-02-20,B00413QQ1E,4.0,Original Cozy mystery series,A3BP86ZB4ME309,"Very original plot idea, fun cozy mystery. Sam, the main character, breaks into houses for the government, to clean them when they are left empty for financial reasons. She also bakes and dreams of opening her own bakery shop. Sweet Masterpiece combines these talents with finding a magic box, a new boyfriend, a buried corpse and a hunt for a killer. Meanwhile, her adult daughter decides to move home as well, putting a cramp in Sam's routine. The plot was original and inventive, although Sam was somewhat insensitive to her daughter's plight. Although Sam's finances were tight, she could have been a little more emotionally supportive and concerned of her daughter's needs. Overall, an original story that serves as a solid base for a series."
2014-03-28,B0041D88X8,4.0,Ploot Ploot,AA0O8DU4FQ7BE,it's uncanny to the extent of a father who wants a child. I applaud Deanna for her ability to be herself even when he isn't in her own world.
2010-12-23,B0041G6KT4,5.0,Powerful sequel,AX48LWJBU5RUH,"In Jason Lett's first book Powerless:  The Synthesis we are introduced to Mira who has been kept in a safe and secure world of her parents making.  The reason?  She has a sister somewhere out in the cruel world who was kidnapped as a child, and she has no special talent or power like the other children.  Something in her world changes and her parents realize they must let her choose her own path.  It is in choosing to enter the world that Mira finds her own type of power and builds friends and allies.In the sequel Powerless:  The Shadowing  we watch as not only Mira, but her friends grow and develop their talents and knowledge.  From an early age they relied only on their talents to help them.  Mira did not have this advantage and had to rely on her wits.  Each child has set off to find a mentor who will help them develop their talent.  For Mira she finds the author of her beloved Science books, Flip Widget.  He puts her through grueling training that often makes you wonder if she will survive it.The one thing I really liked was the way this turned a little darker.  I'm told by my relatives that it is my warped side.  So be it.  It made the story more fascinating.  This book was told from multiple points of view as each child's story of developing their talent is told.  Once again Mr. Letts has left us hanging at just the right place.  At this point all I can say is hurry up with the next one.  This is a must read."
2012-09-30,B0041T4FA2,4.0,Adventure That Grabs You,A1VPXCFO261VWH,"PictureJ.R. Rain gives the reader in The Lost Ark an adventure story of biblical proportions. Okay, maybe not quite that big, but I'm sticking by my phrasing.An American tour guide in Turkey struggles with his own ghosts when a woman from his own homeland walks in needing a guide up Mount Ararat in search of her father who disappeared with a student a month before. She will go with or without him as a guide. Sam Ward takes her up because he knows he is the only one she will be able to trust. The problem lies in someone with wealth and power has 'claimed' the mountain. They find themselves running for their lives from crazed men with weapons and the possibility of Noah's ark being nearby. They are in for the surprise of their lives.The story started off a little slow, but it was building the background and setting the scene with the characters. In fact, that slow start was needed. Rain does an excellent job in developing characters while not making them too close nor too far removed from the reader. The action, once it starts, is non stop. I enjoyed that. The two main characters hardly have time to catch their breaths as nature and madmen interfere with things.I had trouble putting the book down. I had to know where the missing people were, did the find the ark, and how were they going to get out of there. I wasn't disappointed in the story. There is violence and there is swearing in the pages.If you like adventure, a little history, and dealings with crazy men set out to destroy the world, you have to read this book. It is well worth it.Note: This book was purchased with my own funds."
2011-02-18,B0042RUNZE,5.0,No Sophomore Slump,A2T2PWOIL53JU1,"Mira Kolar-Brown's second book, ""Lock Up You Daughters"", is, if anything, even better than her first, ""Hiding the Elephant"".HIDING THE ELEPHANT (Simon Grant Mysteries)But that's not to say that you should skip the second and plunge immediately into the first.That would be a twofold mistake. First, because you'd be passing up a terrific book, and, second, because Mira reveals, in ""Daughters"", some things that remain unresolved and mysterious in ""Elephant"".And, once you've been there, you can't go back.Folks already familiar with Mira's work are going to be pleased to return to her England of the early nineties where they can, once again, catch up with Simon Grant.Simon, for those of you who have yet to meet him, is a moral cop who leads a complicated personal life with his wife and the woman he loves.And they are not the same person.""Daughters"" focuses on the murder of two women, separated by years in time, but whom we ultimately discover to have been victims of the same killer.And both the identity of that killer, and the motive for the deeds, will surprise you.At least, they did me.This book, on Kindle, is an absolute steal. Buy it."
2013-10-2,B0043GX2HU,5.0,Must Read,A28WM3C134GNSZ,"Jennifier you've done it again, love your books, couldn't it down, Romance, Thrilling, drama, Sex, lots of Sex, loved it."
2011-08-30,B0045JK408,4.0,Three free inspirational stories based on the Bible,A2KWQ64TRHB3YH,"Fraley offers three short stories in this Kindle book: Petitions, Angel's Song, and Water. Petitions is a very moving tale of a homeless man who began to drink and became homeless after his wife and child were killed by a drunk driver, and his reactions to the people who gave him money. Angel's Song is a sci-fi story of a world that is not earth. It has many illusions to tales in the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament. Water is based on the New Testament John 5:1-16. It is about a man who refuses to go into water to heal his legs believing that this is pure superstition, until a strange man approaches him."
2012-06-13,B00480OJR8,3.0,I finished it just to give it a chance...,A2ZWG4O33U1CIE,"I knew that this title was geared to younger readers, which generally doesn't deter me too much, I usually see such books as quick reading/easy entertainment.  After the first 2 chapters, I honestly wanted to give up on the story all together.  I mean, really, a girl dreaming of people dying and her parents say ""yes honey, you will dream of tragedy, but nope, you can't do anything about it.""  And ""Happy birthday, your family is special, we all have special powers, but you can't do anything about it.""  It all just seemed ridiculous.  But, I am the type who has to finish a book, I can't leave even the silliest of books unread.  The plot had potential, but the characters had little substance.  The big secret was blown up into public news half way into the story so what more is there for the next 2 books, I'd imagine just continuation of these 3 children running from the government, which makes it less paranormal thriller and more like a new age Holocaust fiction.  I have little to no desire to read the next book; I gave it 3 stars and not 2 because it is better than some of the teen/YA books I have read in the past."
2012-05-26,B00486U5Y8,4.0,Enjoyable Quick Read,AUHFGXAFAHC7Z,"I was thrilled with the short stories about Barbara. I love a peek into her real world. The other stories were nice, but I got the book for the Marr stories. If you're a Barbara Marr fan, don't miss this book."
2012-02-3,B0048EJUHI,5.0,Scorching hot,A196E4Y4DSABN1,"Updated status at 60% - Holy crapolie - hubby is gunna cop it when he gets home.I'm going to fall back into my natural Aussie lingo here and say ""Crikey Moses.""This book was so damn good!! 100% perfection. I loved it from start to finish. And the best part for me? I'm turning 30 in less than two months and my hubby has his own plans for a dirty birthday present so it was DAMN EASY falling into this book and fantasising about all the possibilities.In a drunken moment Evan tells his wife he would love to have sex with another man (now wondering if I should whisper in hubbys ear that I would die to get my hands on Jason Momoa for my 30th)....anyway, Maggie, the most awesome wife in the world, grants him his wish.Insert Paul, the hunky bouncer at their local bar.The sex - erotic, explicit, naughty, dirty, kinky - highly arousing. It tickled me in all the right spots and honestly has me begging to read more by this author.Not only was this story enough to make me crave more for this author - but it was accomplished in 64 pages!!Cara McKenna is talented - no, not just because she can write terrific smut, but because it was extremely well written. I envy her writing style. I cannot fault it.Per.Fect.Ion!!"

2013-11-5,B004BSGWP4,3.0,Prairie Prince,ASA5RSXOAVT12,"A very predictable story with poor grammar that lacked a lot of depth. I would definitely consider it a feel good story, bordering on cheesy."

OMG, I've known him/her for 48 hours and I think I love him/her, but I just know that he/she doesn't love me and I'm so sad.  We are so wrong for each other, this can never work out; but do I really want it to work out?  Add a bratty, annoying five-year-old to the mix and and it's just a very light beach read with little substance."

Take her Editor with her (or get new Editing Software)...  I've never seen such a massive train wreck in reading.  Publishers must be beyond desperate to publish such catastrophic, error riddled trash.  Not worth one star...not even if the story were remotely close to being good.And WHO in their right mind would give this typographical ridden drivel five stars??  Most likely friends and family of this poor excuse of an Author."

As in the style of the Meatloaf Cookbook by Goose Berry Patch, the cookbook provides a wide choice of Mac and Cheese dishes.  I can't wait to try the Mac and Cheese Nuggets and the Pizza or Slow-Cooker mac and Cheese.  Yum.However, the issue is the recipes all flow together, one after another, without breaks. And to easily search the recipes, you need to go to the Index:  MENU > GO TO... > INDEX.It would be great if the book contained a table of contents at the beginning as well as the Index at the end."
2011-07-28,B004GB1TAY,4.0,An exciting Romantic Supsense,A28UUV2QKVVMTW,"I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a romantic suspense novel so much! There are just so many things that drew me into this book. There was the setting: Paris-while I was reading the book I felt like I was experiencing it with Maya.  There were so many twists and turns in this book that I never knew who was coming after the heroine next-I loved it.Maya is one tough cookie. She might be down and out in Paris and have someone framing her for murder-but she's not going to let it stop her from clearing her name and maybe, just maybe finding some romance. Speaking of romance, Simon was a really fun character. I loved how he tried to be all controlling and Maya would have none of it-she would listen to his suggestions, but if she didn't like it she would follow her instincts. I loved the banter between Simon and Maya and for me there was just the right amount of romance mixed in with the mystery at hand. This is one of the few inter-racial romances that I've read and  it makes me wonder why I haven't read more of them.The only real fault I had with The Paris Secret was that I really enjoyed some of the secondary characters that Maya meets on her tour and would have liked to see more of them-they kind of disappeared and reappeared out of nowhere-but I have a feeling that might be how romantic suspense novels flow with secondary characters. Despite that though, this was just a fun read that made me want to read more of this genre!"

2011-06-18,B004HFRMQE,3.0,Violet Tendencies,A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX,"This is a very shot read. I read it in a little over thirty minutes. The questions about Valva are answered in these few short pages. The readers are given very little information as to why Valva did not make it to Green Eyed Demon. It is a highly amusing story that involves a vampire owned strip club and gallons of baby oil. Violet Tendencies picks up the night after Maisie is kidnapped. Sabina and crew are looking for a place to crash for the day while she is hiding from her grandmother and her crew of evil. This story can easily be skipped. If you wish to know the precise details about where Valva the Vanity Demon went, read it here."

The accident is so bad, that one elf tells Santa that they may have to cancel Christmas.  Santa has no plans to cancel Christmas, but he has a decision to make, and that's what to do about the accident, and how to save Christmas.  After a while of thinking and soul searching, Santa has an idea. He has a special plan for the kids on his naughty list.This story is centered around Christmas, but you don't have to read it at Christmas time.  It's a neat lil horror story that will hold your attention.One part is strange, it has some strange spacing on it. Some paragraphs aren't lined up the right way, and it kind of made it a disjointed read. It was just a lil distracting, but nothing major.Overall, I really liked this.  This is a very, very short story.  This just proves that good things come in small packages."

2011-05-16,B004HW7IG6,2.0,Not At All What I Hoped It Would Be,A260P79IPGSZ60,"Unfortunately I can only echo what so many other reviewers have said about this book: although the premise is good, the execution of the storytelling leaves a lot to be desired.  While the opening page and a half of the book is reasonable in terms of grabbing attention - setting up questions in the reader's mind, the following three pages of blatant exposition quickly cools whatever interest was roused for the plight of the two women stuck in the Nevada desert looking for the illegal horse round-up.The book would have benefitted much from an editor's eye being run over the text, followed by a good deal of hard thinking about what to keep in, and what to remove.  The dialogue feels forced and stilted, and in some places kept in merely for the sake of having dialogue, and the recurring instances of exposition - of telling, rather than showing - what is happening do not help to improve the overall impression of the story, of nor the authors skill at telling it.It is a shame, because it could have been such a good book if handled properly."

Then at the bottom you have Lana and Cole and on the right you have a clock which is representing a race against time to find out about the murder and the prophecy.My Review~I can't wait to read the next book in this series! This book was an amazing fast paced read. I loved it and couldn't put it down, although I do wish it was longer and more filled out. It was a great read that I enjoyed. I love the characters and they were interesting. I loved the banter between them. I was expecting more of a battle between the main characters and the evil in the story that lent to the climax of the book. What the author wrote is great, just feel a little let down from a good fight. The fight between them is great. Wish the part where they had to be linked for her to heal was a little more explained. It felt like one minute celebrating the demise and the next in her bed and her suffering. I'm all for paranormal wolf type stories they are my favorite genre!.  This is a great book!  I give it a 5 star review. I couldn't put it down.Amazon book description~Evil is watching and time is running out.

I'm such a fan of delicious men and Noah definitely belongs on that list! I love Edie's ability to create such strong characters who can be vulnerable and human. Real in every sense.This had a bit of a darker side to it that Edie's previous novels. Consensus? I loved it! Sexy men aside, I loved the story. It rang with bits and pieces of an old fairy tale but with a twist and an ending that isn't all to happy. But I love how the characters are able to create their own tale with a much happier outcome.I can't express this enough. Edie is brilliant! I love her snarky characters, the humor, the sex, the incredible story and the perfect narration she is able to spin into a single novel. I was on the edge of my seat while savoring another Ramer masterpiece! This comes highly recommended!"

Kilborn was the first author I downloaded an ebook from...'serial' being my first 'cause it was free. I immediately felt I owed the author something, so paid for 'serial uncut'. I couldn't get enough of what Kilborn provides so seemingly effortlessly, so i had to get Killers, as the follow up novella to serial uncut. Kilborn has singlehandedly ensured I feel I've gotten value from my kindle...I love his books, cannot put them down, and am working my way through his kindle catalogue currently. If you like reading about serial killers and psychopaths, you can't go wrong with Kilborn, but before you read this, grab serial uncut! I just hope he keeps them coming!!!!! I'm kinda glad I've come to his work a little late as it gives me a lot to read from the get go...without waiting!! 'Killers' is five stars. Cannot wait for the next installment."

Even with the ED and T&A I still liked it. Do not look for depth, other than lost loved ones causing the ED and new love conquering all, this is just a fun carpet ride, kick off your shoes and take the book in the spirit it was written."
2012-02-28,B004RD8512,4.0,Greatness thrust upon her,ABMSLHPKJJMYM,"Vianne is a pampered princess in all but name. She is the princesse's agemate and favored lady-in-waiting, and a Duchesse in her own right. She is both a friend and a counselor. Her life in constrained, but not bad, until everything goes to heck.She is caught up in a coup and forced to flee the palace carrying a magic talisman. She spends her whole time scared spitless and dealing with survivor's guilt, but as much as she has been trained to be frail and cossetted, she does manage to get herself going when she needs to.I can certainly see how some readers will be annoyed by her constant desire not to be who the fates are conspiring for her to be, but I think that for someone trained to be a lady, it is probably a pretty huge transition to become a leader. To move from keeping track of romances because they matter in the world of gossip to keeping track of alliances and the world of diplomacy is a pretty big scale change.I really appreciated how much Vianne gave up and had to grow up over the course of the book. She couldn't afford to be uncritical of anyone. The King, her princesse, everyone she met needed to be evaluated or re-evaluated in light of her new roles and duties. Does her Captain of Guards love her? Was the King bleeding the country? Are her new allies just using her? She can't afford to be trusting, although she does attempt to hang on to kindness as much as possible.She is not the sturdiest heroine. She has migraines. She spends much of the book dragged down by a fever. She cries a lot. I am pretty sure I would not cut a stoic figure if you dragged me two weeks by horse when I was suffering from the loss of all I had known. I am inclined to forgive her that, although it is an interesting authorial choice to make her so frail and yes, a bit whiny. I don't think it was an accident, so I want to think about what it means to be a heroine without being strapping.Possibly the best part of the book was the worldbuilding. Everything from the matrilineal descent to the two kinds of magic to the pantheon of gods was interesting and thought-through. I enjoyed the puzzle of figuring out who was what, and it was sometimes highly amusing, like the Pruzian Knives (ninjas!).I think the weakest part of the book was that sometimes you wanted to shake Vianne for not trusting herself. Once, she makes a decision against strenuous advice, and ends up saving herself, but then promises not to go against advice again. You were right, Vianne! Have some faith!I thought the captain of the guard and the bandit king were both compellingly interesting, each with his own flaws and strengths. Tristan (the captain) is pretty humorless, but he has his reasons.On the whole, I am looking forward to the sequel.Read if: you like palace intrigue. You enjoy watching people have greatness thrust upon them.Skip if: a whiny heroine is going to bother you. You want an uncomplicated happily ever after."

Simple and succinct, even though a tad dated (it was written in 2010), the information it contains is still valid for the beginning author who wants to take the publishing game seriously.However, one caveat. Writing is a four step process: writing, revision, publishing, and marketing. Tingle's book covers the latter two arenas. If you are looking for books on writing, either get Stephen King's On Writing or Ray Bradbury's Zen in the Art of Writing: Essays on Creativity.For those of you who already have a saleable product, fiction or nonfiction, Tingle's How I Published My Book And Sold Thousands Of Copies is the next logical step in the learning process."

One of the early authors of psychological thrillers and horror, Stephen King gives credit to both Bloch and Richard Matheson for inspiring him to write.  With good reason.  As the words flow from his brain to the page the reader sees exactly what Bloch was imagining.In This Crowded Earth Bloch foresees a future Earth that is overpopulated.  War and disease are a thing of the past.  This makes for very crowded cities - what do we do now?While this might feel dated to some, please push that aside.  Read one of the masters."

The only reason she knows her name is because her wallet with her Identification was on the dresser.That's how the story begins and she restarts a life with no memory of her past in this world ruled by two camps of vampires.  The Sanguans who still drink from humans, legally between four and five AM, and the Spectavi.  I think Spectavi is supposed to be vampire for vegan though lines blur as the tale unfolds.I give this a five out of five star for world building and four stars for the protagonist who seems to wander through the story becoming a serial victim.  Four stars because she develops later.  The alternate belief systems adopted by the vampires is interesting as is the political twisting in which they engage.  I recommend this series to vampire aficionados.  Enjoy."
2011-04-2,B004TSCOK8,5.0,"Breezy, Fun Read",A91Z0PZ4TOUOC,"Jennifer Monroe's regular ob-gyn is out of the office and she's about to be seen by the new guy - but when she realizes that it's her high school crush, the black-haired blue-eyed guy king of Lake Grayson High School, back home in Michigan, the guy who humiliated her so many years before, she flees without a pelvic examination.Romance novels are formulaic, of course. He loves her, and she loves him, but her insecurities drive her crazy until the last chapter, when she suddenly realizes that there's really no problem after all. Despite that, this novel manages to replace the angst with humor and spirit into the formula, resulting in the kind of fun read that made ""Coffee, Tea, or Me?"" so popular back in the 1960s.The cost of a book these days is the time you invest in reading it, time you can never get back.

2012-06-9,B004V49L24,2.0,Intoxication,A2H587O1MJCEL9,"The version of this ebook I received had two stories. Intoxication, at just over ten thousand words, is long enough to qualify as a novella, and Hitchhiker, a bonus short story of not quite five thousand words. In both cases, the basic story was creative. I especially liked the twist ending of Hitchhiker, which was very clever.The problem I found is both stories needed a lot more polish to rise to their potential. Part of this is inadequate copy editing and proofing. These stories passed my threshold for the acceptable number of such issues for a novel, in spite of being around a quarter the size of a short novel. Additionally, there were many sentences that read awkwardly and the author fell into the clich&eacute;d problem of telling instead of showing. The worst offense in this regard was a clunky narrative in Intoxication explaining what one of the characters had done the night before that didn't fit with the flow of the story and was clumsy to read, despite describing a critical plot twist.**Originally written for ""Books and Pals"" book blog.

Do you kill those who dismiss your fears and believe you are paranoid? What do you do if you start questioning your own suspicions-and sanity-as you take the law into your hands?In this disturbing tale of derangement, a young psychopathic woman is slipping into madness as she fights an enemy that may exist only in her imagination. She has to resort to desperate measures when she realizes that a gun, security cameras in her apartment, and constant vigilance will not be enough to survive.Have you ever had that feeling of being watched, of being followed or that someone was trying to take your life? How would you feel if your boyfriend drank the poisoned coffee that was meant for you?Intoxication is a ride into paranoia as Leslie discovers that someone has been spiking her coffee and not with anything enjoyable. As she tightens her personal security by adding cameras in her office and apartment as well as start drinking bottled water instead of from the company's coffee pot, she comes up with her suspicions. Unfortunately, she is wrong and questions the wrong woman.Eventually Leslie gets her girl and thinks she has everything under control till the game takes a drastic turn.Intoxication is a great, shot, gripping read with twists and turns making it very difficult to put down.Coffee Order: QuadBut wait, there's more.Bonus: ""Hitchhiker"" by Tim Kizer, the first entry in the As the Darkness Falls series.When a serial killer hitches a ride one sunny day in a beautiful California valley, he does not suspect that he may have met his match, who is dead set to take another life. The battle of wits begins and only the most devious mind will survive.Have you passed a hitchhiker by the side of the road and questioned whether you should stop and give them a ride? This is a time to listen to your mommy and not talk to strangers, and please, while you are at it, do not stop to give them a lift.Too bad David didn't attend this life lesson. He stops and picks up that hitchhiker with his thumb pointing towards the sky.

2011-05-31,B004VF6AC2,3.0,Has promise ...good story line,AJY9BZ20C9UU4,"Who or what is there to keep all the paranormal nasties (Vampires, Werewolves, Ghosties, Sirens, etc)  in the world at check? What stops them from going on a rampage, making front page headlines and causing mass panic throughout human society? In Chris Adonn's story, The Eyes that See, it is a highly evolved and secretive race called the Balancers. A race so secretive that to learn of them means death.The Eyes that See, released in March 2011, is a prelude to Chris Adonn's Balancer Series. Where the supernatural world is watched over by The Eyes that See, an ancient secret society in existence since the 5th century BC; it is their job to watch and document all supernatural beings. Adam Smith a fledgling research member of The Eyes that See, has discovered indisputable proof of a new undocumented supernatural race.  Fredrick Bradfield, head of the South African Division and Adam's benefactor has been searching for proof all his life that Balancers actually exists, a supernatural race that keeps the worse of the supernatural creatures from exposing paranormal beings to humankind.  Together, Adam and Fredrick enter a world where such knowledge is taboo; dark secrets are exposed threatening the ancient organization with ruin and meet the secret that is required to silence them.Being that the story was a prelude to a larger work of fiction, the book was a fast read; the story line was well written and guided you through the character interaction at a good clip, keeping you involved in the plot of the tale.  The lack of descriptive narrative on each of the characters physical forms left the characters half formed, leaving it up to the reader to decide how they looked; there was also a large lack of description of scenery and setting which detracted from the short tale giving it a feel of being unfinished and rushed.  Though  the character's personalities did come through the way they spoke making it easy to see their quirkiness.The premise of an ""immortal policing race"" was intriguing enough to keep me reading to the end to see how it all sorted out.  I found the ending a bit disappointing considering the ominous over tone of taboo and threat of death weaved through the story; how no one was allowed to be aware of the existence of the Balancers. The manner in which  the conflict was resolved at the end was quaint and extremely anti-climatic.  But considering that this was a prelude to a greater work and the storyline interests me I will crack the cover ofLegacy  - Book One of the Balancer Chronicles, in hopes that Chris Adonn has put a bit more time in character development and Scenery description."

2012-10-28,B004WLOBR6,5.0,This story swept me away!,A1OX1HK0Y2P5GF,"Beautifully written accounting of a most intriguing life! I didn't want to put the book down! Pearl Buck is a very interesting woman, and now I must find her books and read them!

The first 3 lines set the fast-pace mystery:  ""If you're an old man with lots of money, you're sexy.  But, if you're an old man without any money, you're just a dirty old man.  I'm the latter.""It's about A Barney, Willie, and Oscar the beer drinking monkey.  Also, Willie's cousin Mary helps in various ways.  Their friends also help them every step of the way to solving who killed Freddy.The author, Robert Gannon, has a good handle on senior citizens and their gripes.  The retirement jokes are side-splitting and honest. The characters are people I'd like to know. The daily woes, and activities, of the 50+ crowd ring true.  When I'm not laughing, I'm groaning at the absurdity of it all.  I was chuckling and LAUGHING OUT LOUD throughout the book.I would recommend Monkey Soup Boogie to anyone who likes humor, senior citizens, and a good mystery with a bit adventure.I can't wait for the next book in the series"

2013-09-18,B004XQV79A,3.0,Kind of a mish/mash,A1HR7OQGNB2OS5,"I received a complimentary copy of Oil and Corruption in exchange for an honest review. I will admit to being a little confused by the author's intent for his book. It started out as a very interesting, thoughtful thriller about a person being caught up in events over which he had no control. But somewhere along the line, it morphed into an almost comedic ""thriller"". Over the top characters were introduced and the quiet, unassuming lead character suddenly became a thrill-seeker of the first order, not only surviving but thriving in shootouts and explosions. That kind of lost me. I would have liked to see where the story and characters would have gone without the change in direction. Overall, it was just OK for me. I am giving it three stars because I think/hope that others might like it more than I did."

But two things annoy me and this is the reaon for the 3 stars. Her relationship with her assistant, nothing romantic there for me, - I grant it, this is not the writer's purpose maybe, but I would like some romance in this kind of story- just an older woman who lusts over a younger man. And I can't say I really like her language. Yes she has humour sometimes, but still. It could be so much better with a less vocal heroine."

2013-03-14,B004YQCC3E,4.0,Paranormal Fantasy Served Piping Hot,A25YGT0ZIXTKHQ,"Rob Cornell introduces us to the world of Craig Lockman. A world inhabited by vampires (non-sparkly, definitely not warm and fuzzy), werewolves (you won't be feeling sorry for these four-footed killers), ogres (whom I have a feeling would make great side-kicks), ghosts (ain't no friendly ghosts here), and the sleaziest of humans. Throw in a secret, paranormal-battling government agency that put Lockman out to pasture years before and you've got all the makings of a shadowy world.Lockman's got a daughter he never knew existed. When she hunts down her birth father, it sets in motion a chain of events that threatens the very fabric of our world. In a journey to return his daughter, Jessie, to a safe, normal life with her mother, Kate, they will be way-laid by bad guys of the human and non-human persuasion.There's a secret hidden in the brain of Craig Lockman, one that an evil man from his past, and all manner of paranormal being are hot to unlock. A secret that could destroy the world as we know it.With well drawn characters, snappy dialog, thrills, chills, and enough twists to keep you guessing to the end, this book is one you won't put down until you've read the last page."

2014-04-10,B004YWQSF6,5.0,"Great story line, creative, well written, great read",A5582IFMLAX8I,"After reading another book by Heather Boyd, I bought this book in The Distinguished Rogues Bundle by Heather Boyd. This book is the first in a series of three books about 3 English Lord friends who all find love. I think this book is an excellent read, it is very well written and kept me interested the entire time, making it hard to put down sometimes. It is not as &#8216;Steamy&#8217; as the other book I had read by this author, and the book that comes after this one in the series, &#8220;Broken&#8221;, is definitely hotter, so this book makes for a great Regency Romance.I loved the plot and story line, it was a great concept and she made it believable so it works. Jack, the Marquess of Ettington, is unsure of how to continue dealing with his twin sister, Virginia, Lady Orkney, four years after her husband, who was unusually cruel to her, has died. Virginia has lots of issues she needs to work through, so Jack invites their childhood friend, Constance Grange, aka Pixie, to stay with them in London. Virginia & Pixie are best friends but haven&#8217;t seen each other in years, and Jack was Pixie&#8217;s guardian after her father died, but she reached her majority and is no longer in charge of her as of a year ago. Pixie&#8217;s mother is still alive and has managed to spend all their money so they are broke. The story goes from there. There are a few friends in the book who add to the story and make great minor characters (some of which you can read their stories in the next two books). I also really enjoyed the secondary romance between the sister Virginia, as she heals throughout the book, and another long time friend.The only things I didn&#8217;t like about it was 1) the title, not really sure where it fits? And 2) there is a lot of sexual tension between Jack & Pixie and it takes forever for them to finally kiss, they should have kissed earlier on, they almost do, you think they will than, nothing. But otherwise a great read and I would highly recommend."

I love his work, but sometimes short stories can differ from an authors main works, and not be as good.  With this collection though, Scott shines.  The stories pack a meaty punch and keep you wanting more.  If you're a fan of Scotts previous works, you will definitely not be disappointed.  And if you haven't read anything from him before, pick this up, and become a fan!  Junkies for life!"

2012-03-19,B0050DZEH6,3.0,A great first book in this series,A3BI52QUZP9O8,"3.5 starsThaddeus Kane is a half breed, part human, part demon. Kane and his demon partner, Chaz, work as troubleshooters for their demon boss, Shalim.  During an investigation into the death of a high school quarterback, Kane and Chaz discover that a consortium of Wizards seem to be more interested in young humans than they should be. The deeper Kane digs into the mystery, the more questions he turns up and more and more kids turn up in trouble. Kane partners with a demon from a different clan to try to solve the mystery and discovers that the consortium is after not demons, not humans, but a small group of beings that if they live past their 24th year are seemingly immortal.  Welcome to a world of witches, demons, wizards, immortals, humans and other beings that live in heaven, hell and earth.Kane was abandoned as a child and left to die when he stumbled into the demon world.  Shalim, the leader of the clan he stumbled upon, recognized there was more to Kane than just being a half-breed and allowed him to live among his clan.  Kane had to fight and claw for any respect he gained and prove to Shalim that he was an asset worth keeping.  Kane is loyal to his clan, more than a little jaded about the worthiness of others, but still manages to hold compassion and try to help others who might not be able to help themselves. Others see this trait in him and either take advantage of it, or think that it makes him weak. I think it is something he fights in himself and is not sure whether it's good or bad.  He is a little difficult to get to know but once you do you soon find he is just a big ole marshmallow under the swagger.  He tends to pick up strays and despite himself, gets attached to them.Along with Kane, we meet a mysterious female demon from another clan, Decible, who is hell-bent on helping Kane find the immortal kids and save them.  Kane is a bit wary of her intentions, but they work well as a team and Decible gives us bits and pieces of information about who she might be, but we really don't ever get to know her well.  She seems to know an awful lot about Kane and who he is, more than she should so I have a feeling we are going to see more of her in the future.  Another of Kane's ragtag band of misfits is Jezrielle, one of the teenage immortals. The consortium has Jezrielle in their sights. She reluctantly joins Kane and Decible in their quest.  Jezrielle is a strong, smart, street wise young lady who had to grow up too fast.  She goes from mistrusting Kane, but needing his help, to grudgingly trusting him and even possibly liking him. Rounding out the team is a nurse named Anne Kidd, who it turns out, is a witch who is just coming into her powers.  Anne isn't thrilled with learning she is a witch, she isn't thrilled with helping Kane and is even less thrilled with working with Decible, but Kane manages to pull her into their little group.  The interactions between Decible and Anne were particularly fun to watch and I have a feeling they are going to get more action in the future.While I enjoyed this book, it was a little difficult to follow at times, I kept feeling like I was beginning in the middle of the story and had missed some important background information.  Eventually, we get some of Kane's history and some world building as far as the demon realm goes, but I was still lost as to the politics involved between the Wizards, Demons and Witches. I'm assuming we will get more information as the series goes on, but I think the book would have been better had we had it up front. It will be interesting to see where the author takes us in the future, I'm sure there will be more to be heard from Kane's little group of misfits. There is a decent little reveal toward the end of the book, again it left more questions than answers but it was unexpected. I think if the author works out the kinks of world building and character building this will be a fun series to follow and I'm looking forward to seeing what comes next.Reviewed as a Member of the Paranormal Romance Guild"

I loved the Greek Mythology references and families, I loved every single character that appeared in the book. I am no a big sci fi fan, but Grace got me hooked but good! The language is current, the honesty of her feelings were raw and real.  For this being a first book by a young author, it kept me turning pages! When I read the end of the first book and found there was a second book available, I couldn't turn my kindle on quickly enough! Rifts is every bit as engaging as Huntress! Perhaps I should tell you that I am 65 and not a serious sci fi fan, but I am a serious fan of Grace Murphy!Now if we could just get the third book going...  I'm getting older by the minute! I'm dying to read the next Grace Hunter story! :-)"
2011-08-11,B0052ZAV9S,3.0,More like a 3 1/2 - Very nice novel especially for the price,AYZ3XI8VSE6C1,"For a .99 cent short novel this was well worth the price.  It's a nice and sweet and erotic contemporary Western with a dominating, rich ex-bullrider and a sweet, young naive Ango-Mexican woman.Travis was a champion bull-rider used to having a lot of females throwing themselves at him while he was on the circuit.  Now, as a rich ranch owner, females are few and far between for both him and his ranch hands.  Selena having escaped a horrible situation in Mexico, stumbles onto Travis's land after again escaping another bad situation and badly beaten.I did have trouble after this point believing that no one but Travis recognized the fact at first that she was a female.  I know it was stated several times that females were very rare in the area but still it was just not convincing enough to me.Travis immediately wants her, is drawn to her - because after all she is a young beautiful woman.  He also wants to keep up lock up so that none of his ranch hands find out she is a woman and start fighting over her.The action is basically Travis wanting Selena - getting angry because he knows that he shouldn't seduce a virgin, but can't keep from trying - getting jealous and taking it out on her and everyone - being nice one moment and downright ugly the next moment.That was why I could not see rating this book as a 4 or 5 - it reads more like a old Harlequin book which I'm not that fond of.  It was okay especially for the price but I would not consider it a keeper nor on the same footing as a book in the series by Lorelei James, who is the author that actually got me hooked on ""HOT"" Contempory Westerns.If you are a reader that enjoys short novels with the ""Sweet Virgin and Dominant Male"" theme then you will enjoy this book. For me - the action was just too contrived."

2014-05-9,B005347N30,4.0,Quite amusing,A2FOQS9I8RI0V6,"*Book source ~ Picked up for free on Amazon.Rock Fangsworthy is a vampire, a zillionaire and a cowboy who owns The Double Fang ranch in Bloodsuck Texas.

She&#8217;s also a werewolf and broke. If she can&#8217;t pull the winery up by it&#8217;s grape vines she and her twins will starve or be forced to sell to Rock. Neither option is pleasant.Rock and Buffy once shared some hot times together. Will they be able to put the past behind them and come together as a family? Or will an inept vampire slayer nip any happiness they may create in the bud before it gets a chance to bloom?The title alone drew me in and I picked it up for free awhile ago. Then I needed the &#8216;Z&#8217; for an alphabet challenge, so I figured it was high time I cracked this bad boy open. Oh.My.Lawd. Bless the authors&#8217; hearts for creating an entertaining read. Nine authors took turns writing a parody about the book community&#8217;s current infatuation with cowboys, vampires, werewolves and billionaires. Though they made Rock a zillionaire which is even funnier. The writing is hilarious because it&#8217;s so exaggerated. They put everything a writer shouldn&#8217;t do in this and made it highly amusing. I had many moments of snorts, giggles, snickers and outright guffaws. If you need a pickmeup I suggest picking this one up."

2014-01-13,B0053ZMPJ6,5.0,A Story of Devotion,A3CO4P76XOI2R0,"Solomon Bear is the adored teddy bear of an unnamed young girl growing up in a house where she is neither loved nor wanted.  The bear and the child are devoted to each other in this warm, feel-good story for children.  The little girl is never allowed &#8216;outside&#8217; and she and Solomon spend hours together playing hide-and-seek, dancing, and expressing their deep, never-to-end love for each other.  Then, sadly, the cold-hearted step-mother makes a decision; the little girl has grown too old for such nonsense and the bear has to go.  What worse fate for a young child than to be threatened with the loss of something she loves so much.The distraught little girl runs away and Solomon is left alone.  His last glimpse of his dearest friend, his kindred soul, sees her running towards the forbidding forest.  When she doesn't return, his heart is broken and he begins to ask himself if their love was as real and as lasting, and as unforgettable as they had both said it would be.  Eventually, unable to bear (please forgive the pun) her loss any longer, Solomon seeks the advice of the other toys, toys he has never mixed with before, to find a way to leave the house and go in search of his beloved companion.Phillip Laird&#8217;s The Story of Solomon Bear is a beautifully, poetically written tale about the strength of an innocent, enduring love and a bond which cannot be broken.  In parts it may be a little too gushy for some, but it is still undoubtedly a wonderful read, which I think which will become a classic one day.  Claudia Gadotti&#8217;s illustrations, in black and white, are simply gorgeous, too.Whatever your age, if you have ever loved a teddy bear, you will be enthralled by this emotive book.  It is a total delight to read, either quietly or out loud.  There are a few good lessons in there, too.  I highly recommend this story and am giving it five solid stars.This review is also published at Mungai and the Goa Constrictor  [...]"

This series focuses largely on Link, Ethan's best friend whom I love.  The forward motion of the series-level plot doesn't advance too much, the focus being on Link and his story.  But learning about Link was more than sufficient!Things to love about Beautiful Creatures...--Link.  A supporting role within the series, yes, but one that is integral to Ethan's character as well.  He is funny and fun-loving and a spark of light in a story line that is often rather dark.--The bromance.  I love the friendship between Ethan and Link.  They compliment each other and their is unwavering support and loyalty.Things I wanted more of...--n/aMy recommendation:  This novella is a link between the first half and the last half of the series and a must read for fans of the series!"

They will use coercion and torture, and even murder.When the sisters meet up for a long awaited reunion, Evelyn is forced to trust Rhett after the murder of one of them. She is constantly on the run with him, uncertain is she can really trust him to protect her. Before long, it doesn't matter because a traitor keeps Rhett and Evelyn barely a step ahead of the Templars chasing her.Non stop action, thrilling chases, and heartbreaking loss. Add just a touch of romance, and you have pretty neat recipe for good urban fantasy. This novel is great for young adults because there are no extended love scenes. Highly recommended."

2013-10-19,B005CFEN1U,4.0,New World,A2U8YWPP1PYHJM,Great action adventure story.  Two misfits find their way after enduring horrendous tragedy.  On the trail of revenge they discover more than they could have imagined.
2013-07-29,B005CQ80R2,5.0,An excellent entry into the series,A7AO0PBCKSW82,"Wow! This one kept me turning pages, agonizing with Sam over what she could and couldn't, should and shouldn't do to save the life of her beloved young son. Also, the case she was working with the child abduction was heartbreaking. Then she faces betrayal from an unexpected source and help from another. It's nice to see her find another female cop vampire that she can be friends with and also to have the honest support from her detective cop friend. I felt that the end came too quickly.... I wasn't ready to be done yet! Looking forward to the next book and glad this one didn't end on a cliffhanger.Heat factor mild."
2011-07-14,B005CQ80R2,5.0,SERIES JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER!,A1YS6TQKZTP5LP,"Samantha Moon is back and feistier than ever.  Never underestimate the power and determination of a mother, especially a vampire mother!  J.R. Rain does such a good job of capturing the emotions and essence of his characters while flying through twists and turns of plot at breakneck speed.  Samantha has become a very dear friend of mine and I can't get enough of her."
2011-08-27,B005CRQ546,5.0,One of My Favorite Reads This Year,A2E9HDZXQORZLA,"She was created for one purpose. To kill. She has no name, just a designation. Her kind, bitterns, are genetically engineered clones that serve the fae lords as their keenest hunters and assassins. They are little more than animals and are treated as such. She has always been different, however, resistant to conditioning, rebellious, obstinate, and unbreakable. No matter how brutal her masters' torture, she defied restrictions. And she escaped.Since she crossed over to the world of round ears, to the human realm, she has pursued one goal with frightening intensity. Find the immortals who shared a common enemy with her and ally with them. Get the information she needs. Kill the psychotic vampire allied with the Dark fae king, then, when the walls between planes fall on Samhain, return to the fae realm and release her beserker rage all over the king and whomever else has the misfortune of getting in her way. She will slaughter them all. She knows this. She will not survive. She knows this too.With her first goal nearly in sight she is forced into a slight change of plans. The immortals she was tracking are battling rival vampires and fae beasts and to save them, she lets her berserker rage free. When she wakes up back at the building she'd been squatting in since arriving in Dallas, she comes nose to furious nose with an exquisitely carved and obviously disgusted Native American face.That face belongs to Koda, ancient guardian, protector of his people, and friend of the immortals she was tracking. He loathes her, thinking her fae, as the fae have annihilated his race for centuries. Convincing him that she's not fae, that in fact she reviles them at least as much as he, is a herculean task. As it becomes clear that she's being targeted by her former fae masters, and the vampire she planned to execute suddenly ups the stakes on an impending war with humans and immortals alike, joining forces with Koda becomes the only viable strategic option.Two magical beings with a common goal, beginning as enemies, becoming wary allies. They must battle against the forces of evil before the death count spirals out of control and the land is scoured by the ravages of war. Along the way they will discover a fiery need for each other that neither had anticipated and it will forge allies into friends, then lovers. He is Koda. She is bittern...and she calls herself Sephti. Together they are the best hope for mortal and immortal alike.One hundred and ninety. That's the number of books I've read, including this one, since January 1st. Nine. That's the number of those books, including this one, that I've tagged as a favorite. It's definitely not a tag I give out generously. It's also the first time I've EVER tagged a series book as a favorite when I haven't read the preceding book/books in the series. Those are the facts.Killing Timedeserved it. That's my opinion.I was a little bowled over by Paige'sKilling Time. I wasn't expecting to be as impressed as I was, but despite not reading the first book in the series,Stealing Time(an oversight I can assure you I WILL be rectifying), just about every single one of my Happy Reader buttons got stroked, tickled, and pushed with delicious abandon.Fantastic characters - especially Sephti, who I was completely in love with before the first chapter was done. A layered and imaginative plot that struck the perfect balance between the urban fantasy elements and paranormal romance elements. A rich and vibrant world and mythos brimming with originality. A narrative that brought all those aspects together, reached out and grabbed me by the throat and carried me along for the duration. Man, Paige is a hell of a storyteller.The relationship between Sephti and Koda was so satisfying. Not only did they work well together as a couple, providing the romance lover in me with tons of heart-pounding moments of love, angst, and sexy sensuality, but Sephti was also a complete and three dimensional heroine in her own right, independent, deadly, and more than capable of not only pulling her own weight but rallying those around her to pull theirs too. I could easily imagine her as the center of her own urban fantasy series, and that satisfied the UF lover in me.The bad guys were heinous and truly threatening, their impact on the world and the characters tragic, so the plot started strong and maintained its intensity throughout. There was conflict on all sides, and Paige kept me guessing on what dangers would pop up next, satisfying my need for pulse pounding entertainment that ratchets higher and higher as the story progresses. There was little in the way of story down time or moments when the pacing lagged - hell, there was hardly a moment for the characters to catch a breath before the next twist in the plot roared over them. I was captivated from cover to cover.There were a few places in the narrative that I think would have been enhanced for me if I'd read the first book, some setup for the arc of the series plot, some secondary and ancillary characters with obvious backstory I wasn't familiar with, and previously established relationships that I had to guess at. Never once did I feel lost, however, or think I was missing an important aspect of the story because of it. This novel stands well on its own, but I'm still kicking my own butt for missing out on the start of it all. I can only imagine how much more entertaining I would have found this book had I readStealing Timefirst.Even without it, I loved this book. I loved Sephti. Koda remained a bit of an enigma, but I liked him very much. I loved their relationship and the conflict of the external threat. Yup, this book has a little bit of everything that most tickles me as a reader, and it joins the select list of books I've read this year that I've tagged as favorites. I can't wait for more.Disclosure: An ARC of this book was provided to me by Carina Press via NetGalley.

2014-07-10,B005D75Z8C,4.0,Jack Reacher,A2UE20ZV1QWM9O,Good foundational piece for what's to come. I am just getting back into Jack Teacher books and thoroughly enjoyed Second Son and An Affair. Will continue reading the series of Jack Reacher  stories.
2012-01-29,B005D75Z8C,4.0,Don't mess with the Special Investigators,A3HYM6QLCDIR2P,Anyone who has taken a liking to Jack Reacher will get a buzz from this story that takes the reader back in time to when Reacher first demonstrated his talent for solving puzzles as well as breaking heads of people who got in his face.
2014-03-28,B005DHYGMS,3.0,Would read over again,A3LLTFNIUOPOLM,I thought it was interesting but in the end it comes down to most people are a mixture of both. It does make you think about your own motives more though.
2011-12-31,B005DHYS80,3.0,It's Ok,A2PEZZF6ZS0RSZ,"It shows the difference between a true Christian (Fisher) and the mysterious boy trapped in his body versus a fake like Pastor Ford. A lot of action, but I felt the book is little too long for me. Otherwise, pretty well-written. There is a lot of adventure, about people surviving and getting away from the bad guys. So, it's pretty good otherwise. I just was a little confused."
2012-01-5,B005DKRFV4,5.0,An excellent medieval mystery,A34U4Y40W1GW9I,I've read all of the Gil Cunningham mysteries and found this one to be just as enjoyable and just as quirky as the others.  There were many plot twists that led this way and that and the ultimate solution was very satisfying.  A little romance added to the interest and I was very touched by the way things worked out in the end.
2011-09-10,B005DT9R02,1.0,Incredibly disappointing,A260QLS8Z33KCQ,"This book had a good premise - a retired KGB agent sent from modern Russia to kill a member of the International Monetary Fund.  Unfortunately, the premise was the only good thing about this book, as the characters and situations were simply implausable.  Just before an important vote, a US IMF member is killed by faulty brakes on his brand new Lexus and despite the police being surprised, the incident is treated strictly as an accident! Even the new widow is unbelievably stoic about her husband's death and is more interested in planning the funeral than grieving or questioning. Coincidently, his brother happens to be a retired CIA operative and he alone is suspicious.  Even when a second member of the IMF narrowly escapes a terrorist-style bomb and the brother tries to impress the importance, do the US authorities seem somewhat interested.  Where's Homeland Security, the FBI, even the CIA?Without giving away the whole plot (although it wouldn't be a loss) the story moves to Russia, where the brother, his gutsy girlfriend and the original KGB agent team up to right all wrongs.  The few interesting looks into today's Russia are dwarfed by the repetitive, angst-ridden political intrigue.  If we heard a certain politician was ambitious and ruthless once, we heard it several times.  The chase scenes were yawn-worthy and I found myself paging through to find something of interest.  I kept reading to see when the US would finally show up!  They never did!What a waste of a good premise!"
2011-07-30,B005F5Q86U,5.0,Awesome! Spellbinding! Edge of your seat!,A1T90O1KTDQSY8,Vaughn does it again with another awesome book of Marten Kluge. I highly recommend this book for your reading pleasure and edification.(the word sounds good!) Worth every penny! Enjoy!
2014-02-9,B005F7LQBA,4.0,Good Start to the Series,A22GGHISKRVAOX,"I prefer first-person books and this novel didn't disappoint, being narrated by a girl who can run fast and is sent to Montana for special training."
2013-01-27,B005FCYB9O,5.0,Never,A1KY7J4P8V4VVO,Just remember...suicide my sound like the easiest solution but it's not. This book taught me that. Nothing is worth that.
2013-09-6,B005G4QEDC,5.0,Ari's review,A2M3T8MZ2ZJTHW,Amazing and I'm totally in love with these series. I bought all three of the series. Buy it!!! Seriously do buy it it's perfect!
2013-10-6,B005G826KI,4.0,"well written, interesting short",A1W387D3D5OL0F,"This seventy page short is a prequel to a series I have not yet read.  As an introduction to a longer piece, it had adequate development of the setting and the few characters presented. While passengers and much of the crew were in stasis, those awake monitored the ship as well as the space they traveled through on their way to Earth. A routine check alerts the crew to the presence of an object that will nearly intersect their path.  The Captain is compelled to make a decision to investigate or fly by.  The piece was well written and interesting enough to grab my attention. I will continue reading the series."
2012-03-13,B005GA7MU0,5.0,Ist er nun ein Verbrecher oder nicht?,A1HPT6QDUQEWB5,"Ich habe schon zwei der Wolfson-Western gelesen. Da tauchten immer mal Andeutungen &uuml;ber die Vergangenheit von Al Wolfson auf und ich hab mich gefragt ... Irgendwie hatte ich die ganze Zeit den Verdacht, er ist eigentlich ein Verbrecher, der sich hinter dem Sheriff-Stern versteckt.Was (nicht nur) im Wilden Westen ja nicht ungew&ouml;hnlich ist.Und dies hier nun f&auml;ngt an mit: ""Ich habe einen Mann umgebracht ... und daf&uuml;r bezahlt: f&uuml;nf Dollar."" Klingt bisschen zynisch.Nein, das verrate ich nicht, was das bedeutet.Jedenfalls kl&auml;rt dieses Buch ""endlich"" ein St&uuml;ck von Wolfsons Vergangenheit auf. Im Nachhinein war es ganz reizvoll, dass ich es nicht zuerst gelesen habe.Lesen sollte man es aber auf jeden Fall."
2013-12-28,B005GI6XYS,4.0,A good read,A2CMF3BGONEGXX,"This book kept me entertained and was a good read.  The story line was great, and although could have been developed more, it was fun.  A mystery book that, although was about bad things, kept it light in most places and could still make me smile.  The inventive investigator was good at finding out what happened, keeping her little jobs on the side a secret and the casual way she went about interrogating people was fun."
2013-05-16,B005GLN2G2,5.0,Just WOW.,A3KI93AT8FAXI1,"Borealis is a beautiful, poignant and yet still scary book. I love Mr. Malfi's stories, but this one wins the prize! I want everybody to read this short. Thanks for another great tale."
2011-09-6,B005GQ87YE,3.0,Sugar Free Romantic Suspense,A2A118C3EOJLL6,"This book is romantic suspense light, or maybe extra light.  I read a lot of romantic suspense/military ops bks and found the first bk in this series to be light. The premise is good, but the story was too short and the hero/heroine are thrown together for whorl wind suspense and then on the last page they kiss and decide they want an HEA.  REALLY?  Decided to try bk 2 thinking the first bk was the wind up and this one might be on its way to the home run. Not so.. once again, the story jumps right in with the suspense with too few pages and then the last few lines are the kiss and HEA.  I'd rather have an equal balance of suspense with a romance. This series has likeable characters but would have potential with a better balance and a longer story. These books read more like a novella than an actual book."
2012-04-7,B005GQLJUS,4.0,A Lovely Romance,A1LNCVSKJLZ9VI,"I deeply enjoyed Susan Sizemore's fantasy romance, ""Memory of Morning"".When I began reading this book, I found the pace slow, but I'm very glad that I kept reading. Susan Sizemore's writing has a lovely, quiet pace that I found deeply enjoyable.  I enjoyed the gentle unfolding of the heroine and the rich layers of her world-building.Wonderful romance, fascinating world that I hope to have the chance to visit againVanessa"

2012-01-1,B005H8HIC8,4.0,Fall Into His Arms,A2Q5XZTCMDEQDT,"In the beginning I wanted to smack around the H/H a little bit, but they worked it out. Some hot lovin' and a little mystery.  It was a good read."
2013-10-29,B005HPYWUM,5.0,Snowbound/Karen Fenech,A35GROQZI0956Y,"Great story, characters, suspense and intrigue.  The second book of the protector series was equally as good as the first. Karen Fenech is a good writer and her plots are excellent.  Nothing slow orbiting about her books.  Cannot wait to read #3."
2011-08-25,B005HZZIU0,5.0,What an ending!,A21BMUDTTM3HBR,"I couldn't wait for this last book to come out.  It was worth the extra three days wait.  I haven't cried while reading a book in a while, and this one did it.  The ending wrapped up the series very well.  It didn't leave you thinking what was that.  I was really impressed with this series.  It is well worth the price and more."
2011-12-14,B005IL1XB6,5.0,"Incredible world-building, intriguing characters and a real sense of magic",A2NRBSD3QE26L4,"Characters with depth; a credible premise in a magical world filled with Djinns, Arifa and Siofra from folklore; all the richness of A Thousand and One Nights; and a real talent for description make ""A Thousand Glass Flowers"" a sweeping historical fantasy that will particularly enchant lovers of all things exotic.Focusing on the lives and desires of two protagonists--Lalita, a talented scribe sold into the Sultan's harem; and Finnian, an immortal with the ability to mesmer (perform magic)--this novel draws the reader into its intricate web. Although the characters are also featured in Batten's earlier series, readers can be assured that ""A Thousand Glass Flowers"" works well as a stand-alone offering, and is worthy of its glowing reviews."
2012-09-10,B005J61DQA,5.0,We're Just Two Lost Souls Swimming In A Fish Bowl,A34P3STMKD3HBX,"THE LAND OF LATER ON by Anthony Weller offers a new interpretation to the ages-old conundrum, ""What happens to us after we die?"" the literary style of the prose could be off-putting to some readers who need an action word in every clause.  However, the tension here is more broad than merely learning who has done what to whom and how badly it hurt -- though there is some of that.  Instead, the larger value here is the controlled experiment performed by the author through his main character and narrator, Kip.Kip is searching through the afterlife for Lucy, both now memories to this world.  She is the love of his life and that is the whole of what matters to him.  Weller's experiment, then, poses this: ""Does who we love and how we love them, matter?  And will it matter after this life has concluded?""The book is a rather knowing character study -- where the character is not really a particular individual but a relationship itself, spanning across decades of time and a multitude of distances throughout the mind and an after-life landscape as complicated and fraught with danger as is the land of the living.""The world exists in all its infinite detail,"" Weller writes as Kip, ""which, going through the motions, we ignore on a daily basis."" Each reader may come to their own interpretation of this novel.  For me it is a wrestle with the infinite detail not just within our world but within our relationships.  The tiny apartment of Kip and Lucy is just a microcosm in the vastness of literature, music, space and history, but become elevated by exploding it outward to examine in slowed motion. We are shown all the moving parts of their storied history together and, thus, understand Kip's very specific drive to keep it alive -- even after his own death.In THE LAND OF LATER ON Weller has built a complex world, replete with a heritage of literary greats and musical references that contribute to the realness of such an unreal place.  For me, a weight lifted after reading. I might not know what exactly happens following death but I know I'm not alone in the eternal wonderings of it. And there's an enormous value in sharing *that* relationship with all of humanity."

2011-11-15,B005JFBISE,1.0,No where near as good as the first book.,ABPSHGXLTE204,"I loved her first book ""My Fierce Highlander"" and couldn't wait to get the second... especially with all the good reviews.  But, this is not at all what I expected.  I honestly can't make myself finish the book (2/3rds left)...  I just can't take anymore sniveling from the female character (Angelique).  She's just exhausting... I honestly could not understand her at all... never once did she give Lachlan the benefit of the doubt.  I have no idea why he stuck around listening to all her accusations, her mistrust, and hurtful words.  He deserved way better!As for the plot twists... there were more than enough...  pretty much everyone was out to kill them or break them apart... it got to be pretty ridiculous... Like really????  6 + people plotting against them... not to mention all their minions... I was rolling my eyes by the time I stopped.I'm sorry I bought the book... wasn't worth the 5 dollars at all."
2013-10-15,B005JM9U14,5.0,"building fences, etc",A1SLMFWK0YMLAF,"I really enjoyed this book.  Although the plot at times was predictable, the characters seemed real.

2013-02-17,B005KIODI2,5.0,A short enjoyable read!,A32FGQC01CUA4V,"Love the characters of Nell and her brother who turn to a life of crime to help make ends meet. The characters are well presented an you find yourself wanting them to succeed in what they are doing without getting caught. The love story is fun and light hearted and the characters wrap up in a good way.As with most of these novellas this book is a light read, but that's why I find them so enjoyable. I love to read Kate's books in between larger books or on the side of larger books. Some editing errors but that's expected for this price.Completely enjoyable!"
2014-05-7,B005KSRURS,5.0,WELL WORTH READING!,A1DN7FG50N95LQ,"Never has one book packed so much between its covers or had such a huge impact on my future reading. Ms. Frost&#8217;s books are always a must read for me. With MAGIC GRAVES I&#8217;ve been introduces to the writings of Ilona Andrews and I am counting myself the luckiest reader in the world to have discover her. Since both Ms. Frost and Ms. Andrews have novellas and excerpts from some of their other work I&#8217;m going to take them one at a time. Just a note here before I do. Both novellas included in MAGIC GRAVES are important to their respective series and should not be missed.I&#8217;m going to begin with Ms. Frost&#8217;s contribution to this book. Her novella is titled ONE FOR THE MONEY. A classic Cat and Bones story filled with wit, danger and nooky. What should have been a simple assignment turns into one of the closest calls Cat encounters in her many adventures of flirting with death. Take a spoiled-rich college girl that needs protection, add Cat&#8217;s mom Justina holed up in the same house as Bones and you have a recipe for disaster. Thing is, the danger comes from an entirely unexpected source. Fantastic read!As an added bonus to ONE FOR THE MONEY there are two excerpts included. The first three chapters to HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS, a Cat and Bones tale, will hook you and not turn lose until you get your hands on the story. The second excerpt comes from the first novel in the Night Prince Series call ONCE BURNED. This series is going to be about Vlad Tepesh, better known as Dracula. Just don&#8217;t call him that, he hates the title. From the little bit of the story that is shared I can already tell this will be another series by Ms. Frost I&#8217;ll simply have to read. No getting around it.Now on to Ms. Andrews. Thank you to whichever book god that lead me to the discovery of her stories. If you have already read any of her books you will know that I am truly grateful to be able to add her to my list of must read authors. If you&#8217;ve been reading her Kate Daniels series and not read A QUESTIONABLE CLIENT you really should correct that mistake. If you&#8217;ve not been reading the series this will give you a tiny bite into her world and the legion of strange creatures, both human and very non-human, that inhabit her post-apocalyptic Atlanta. Kate is a mercenary with extraordinary skills that takes a bodyguard assignment. To say the client, Saiman, is strange and dangerous would be a monstrous understatement.  I cannot read any of the Kate Daniels books and not crack a smile or chuckle out loud. Can&#8217;t be done. I&#8217;m obsessed with her books.Ms. Andrews has included an excerpt from book three in the Edge Series, FATE&#8217;S EDGE. And yes, this will be one more series I will be starting. The other sneak peek was a rough draft from a novella she was working on at the time. MAGIC GRIEVES will be one more story involving Kate. For a rough draft it was great and as intriguing as all the rest of the books in the series. Looking forward to being able to add it to my library.I can easily give this my HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION to anyone over the age of 18."
2013-09-2,B005KV4JW4,3.0,cute short story,A3A91JFG676EPA,"I love the novels, and this story doesn't fail to entertain, but I'm not satisfied that it was long enough to be worth the $0.99 I paid for it. Yes, I know, only a dollar, but you expect more than four or five pages worth of reading for that nonetheless. I do anyway."
2012-01-30,B005LDP182,4.0,Interesting but not gripping,A2A41ZRVMO8WG2,"During one night Gwyneth of Blackthorne is trying to flee from her abusive uncle's home. However, she is discovered by Bran The Fair, whom she happens to know since when she was a little child. Bran is the illegitimate son of the noble man who killed her parents and cast her out. Some years later Gwyneth was married to Geoffrey, the legitimate son of the nobleman, however, Gwyneth never allowed the marriage to be consummated by the murderers of her family, which finally led to the annulment of the marriage. Anyway, Bran is on his way to his father's deathbed where he is really stunned because his father orders him to take over Blackthorne and marry Gwyneth. Bran is more than satisfied because finally he has a wife, land and title. However, Gwyneth isn't that happy about the developments. Firstly, she doesn't want to be married to another son of her family's murderer and secondly, she strongly believes that Blackthorne should be returned to its legal heir - and these aren't the only problems Bran has to face, since the villagers seem to be loyal to some ""rebels"" who hide in the woods and stir things.Bran and Gwyneth were likeable and very realistic main characters. Bran was presented as a visionary and leader who respected his fellow knights and the villagers. Gwyneth on the other hand had to face her difficult past, a new unwanted marriage and was continuously under the pressure of a very serious secret that could endanger her future with Bran. Her constant struggle to choose between growing love to Bran and the loyalty to her family was nicely put without becoming too tedious.The story line was simple, clearly and well-arranged and offered even some unexpected twists and turns. However, the author tried with her ""epic"" way of writing to stress the time period during which the story played. Not that I haven't experienced this before but in this book I had the impression that this ""phenomenon"" occurred more than it should which didn't really let me enjoy the book. I'm sure that this is completely irrelevant for native speakers but for me it was a serious drawback."

Her crushing on Rob and then somehow dating him later was so obvious that he was just using her. Then when their second date came and he ditched her, I thought that was awful! And she had to walk home with Benji just appearing out of nowhere and taking her to an amusement park was very peculiar. Liked how did he just found her out of nowhere when she was alone? Anyways, as soon as they got to the Ferris wheel and dropped and Benji saved them from being a pancake, I knew he was a vampire. I would LOVE to read the next book to know how their relationship goes after that and what would happen to them if another vampire came along and found out that Benji told mortal his secret."
2013-06-3,B005MPELOE,5.0,Good but short,A77RRHE6R55DT,Since I have read the darkness trilogy.  Kat was good with being a vampire and dealing with the Edison group.  I was happy that she had Neil to help with her first feeding instead of just on her own where she may have taken a life.
2012-07-11,B005NKA0LQ,5.0,My Fav,A3LIXS92FM24T1,I Loved Dior and Trinity OMG!!! This was a good hood love story and it kept me interested till the last page.Trinity was a ride or die chick for real and Dior was her King.I cant wait to read more work from the author.This book is worth buying..
2012-01-17,B005ORV3IM,5.0,Follow this alternate-history author,AB8SPOUZF4KDW,"This is an author you need to follow.  For fans of alternate histories, this is a must read series of books.  In Castro's Bomb, the author trasports you to the tumultuous time of the Cuban Missle Crisis.  Only this time, Guantanimo Bay Naval/Marine Base is invaded, sucessfully.  What follows is a fun ride for the reader.  I'd rather not give any plot twists away.Suffice to say, you'll enjoy the read.While many of the reviews on Amazon ""nit-pick"" every slight detail, and I can agree that when an author gets his facts and figures wrong on simple details, especially military hardware and weapons, it can interrupt the verisimilitude (willing suspension of disbelief) and ruin an otherwise good book.  This is especially an irritation to old soldiers such as myself.However, few authors today have the breadth of knowledge, or on Amazon, a team of editors to fact check this stuff, not that all editors catch it regardless.Conroy gets it right, more than not, and weaves a tale that is both interesting and fun to read, with just enough plausibilty to keep all but the most nit-picking skeptics and fault-finders at bay.Buy the book, get plenty of sleep before you start reading as once you start, you really want to just keep reading, and pretty soon, like me, you'll have bought everything this guys puts out.You'll be happy you did."

2013-05-30,B005U3HT4M,3.0,Decent space opera,A2UWPPU5GZLMQZ,"I mostly enjoyed the book, though having a second earth polity collapse under its own idiocy written by the same author (The Empire's Corps) isn't the most exciting idea for a story line. My big problem with the book is the terrible copy editing. I understand that self-published authors don't have access to copy editors, unless they pay for them themselves. However, this book was worse than usual. Some chapters had more than two obvious errors per page, mostly the kind of wrong words that pass spell check, but would be easily caught by even the most basic of copy edits. It was bad enough that it broke my suspension of disbelief."

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because her timeline seemed to be a bit off at times. I highly recommend this book!

2013-02-4,B005Y2MYNK,1.0,Bored housewife,A7AO0PBCKSW82,"I was turned off by this story and I had to reread it to figure out why. After thinking about it, I realized that I just did not care about the main character,Landry James because she doesn't care about anything but self gratification and sex. She is basically an amoral, bored housewife who doesn't love her husband, only the things he gives her, and seems to spend her days caring only for her grooming and looking for new sex partners. Even when she and her friend are threatened at a sex club, she's excited by it, not worried that her friend had a knife to the throat. In the end, she is recruited to be a sort of Mata Hari. She'll get paid by the government to have sex with men and get pillow talk information from them because she'd be doing it anyway, so she might as well do it for her country (and money). Landry did not appear to have any motives other than selfishness or to have any deep mental processes. I think I'll pass on her further ""sex agent"" adventures, I just don't care what happens to her.Heat factor hot."
2013-09-10,B005ZI2X4I,5.0,Wonderful!,A731QPENIZ4QQ,"I bought this book for my three year old son and as usual with a Peter Collier book he was totally mesmerised by the beautiful illustrations and great rhyming tale.Offered as a warning to adults against the decision not to permit the building of snowmen when the snow comes, this is a delightful read for children and adults alike.A well-deserved thumbs up!"

2013-08-31,B0062EJBM6,5.0,Help for this non-techie reviewer,A265DSBRM4KWH9,"I downloaded this book and just got around to reading it. I can't get Google Playstore on my new 7"" Polaroid tablet so I was looking for some basic  apps to at least approximate those on Google for me. And, lo and behold I got some suggestions and did download them to the tablet. I have a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2, a 10"", that is compatible with Google apps and it came with some apps also. I got the little  Polaroid so  that I could just drop it in  my purse and have e-mail  and my Kindle books wherever I go. Anyway, the 100 ways... has certainly given me much-needed help. While I didn't load dozens of apps, this book gave me the kind of help I sorely needed. I also learned how to use Dropbox and am excited to have it available. For anyone who also has a tablet non-compatible with the Google Playstore, I recommend the Amazon app store. You can just put in the name or description of the app you would like and the store will come up with some possible alternatives."

2011-11-29,B0064GU2AM,4.0,A female Percy Jackson,A2SPCMHMXS2QSF,"Finally--a female Percy Jackson!  I have been waiting and waiting and wondering when an enterprising author would hit upon the idea and I have finally found it.  Zoe is all the best of Percy--funny, spunky and prone to a lot of trouble which made for one great read.After wandering into a forbidden temple while on a trip with her archaeologist uncle and aunt, Zoe is transported to ancient Greece.  Really ancient Greece-1000 BC or so.  To find her way back, she must travel to the oracle (isn't there always an oracle) and follow said directions.  Of course, along the way, she must endure trials on Mt. Olympus, rescue various creatures from destruction and get in a catfight with a teenaged Hera.Did I mention she also meets and falls in love with a cute teenage boy who saves her on more than once occasion.  Maybe because he's Zeus and, like, the god of everything.  His friends and girlfriend Hera are not happy with the arrangement and throw even  more deadly obstacles in the path of the star-crossed lovers.There is so much to like about this book.  Right away, from the very first paragraph, I felt like I knew Zoe and she was talking straight to me.  That kind of connection isn't often found in books and I relished it, reading way past the time I usually give to myself and burning a few dinners in the process.  It has a great message in it for young girls and isn't just mindless drivel like many of the girly books out there.  This is one heroine a young girl could really sink her teeth into and learn a valuable message about to boot; namely, that, the trials and obstacles in life often teach us about what we are made up of and teach us what we want in life and what is really  important.  The perfect combination of romance and adventure.The book is a first in a trilogy so be prepared to keep reading--the first one ends in a cliffhanger that wasn't satisfying at all.  Now, I just have to wait for the next installment!"

2014-01-18,B0066X5ZTG,5.0,Great attention to detail in this fast moving story,AG7ZPVWR3W5DH,"As a lover of all things elfin, the second I laid eyes on the cover of this book, I wanted to read it.I found the characters all extremely well created and details were abundant throughout.  This is no small feat as our main character Zyre (she is an elf) travels to different worlds in her attempt to flee from a pending arranged marriage.I liked (a lot) that the author gives a bit of a background regarding characters and situations.  This starts from the beginning when pixies are being plied with gin in taverns.  Then she mentions that elves are masters at being able to hide in plain site.  Details such as these gave depth to the story and helped me understand various situations as they unfolded.  Moving throughout the magical realm was seamless due to the placement of the details.I liked the mix of fantasy, romance, action and suspense that flowed through the book as Zyre travels from her own world to the world of humans.  The addition of vampires adds a nice twist and the story continues to flow well with the addition of other characters such as the cat Zyre encounters once we are to the part about the vampire house.I liked this book for many reasons.  It is a fairly fast moving story and somehow the author managed to included great detail, yet not slog us down by doing so.I definitely recommend this book if you like fantasy reads especially about elves."
2014-07-7,B006794HOI,4.0,Kinda Cute and funny,A2520OGEZVC4FZ,"This was a good read though, there has got to be a time with Joel and Tom grow up.  They both make good husbands, surprisingly but they still act like little boys trying to best each other.  I still loved the Ruth Ann Nordin's Nebraska Historical Romans books."
2012-05-25,B00679LQIS,3.0,Interesting...,A1X81GFCRO2ACE,"The 'story' gets a little boring after a while, but typical in an 'old marriage'... men put up with a lot, just keeping their mouths shut; when women no longer want to, they walk."
2012-12-10,B00697UWA6,4.0,A good read,AR1KHL65URR3V,I fell into this book and was surprised that it turned out to be a good page turner.  I was much disappointed that it ended abruptly.
2012-06-13,B006AL4YC8,4.0,An homage to Atticus Finch,A14I311IIUMBWC,"with a lawyer who is truly fighting a battle that puts him at odds with the current tenor of the 'societies' norms.In this world, the ""Arcanes"" are recently revealed, and much of society reviles their existence, but for Hunter. A lawyer with a penchant for the underdog, and a niche practice where he defends and provides legal advice for the arrested and persecuted beings.Incredibly well written, with a nice nod to To Kill A Mockingbird, we see the overt separation and distrust and even irrational dislike of the arcanes, perhaps simply because they are different and the years of legends and exaggerated stories have created that ingrained fear.  And of course, there is election-time politics and grandstanding to deal with as well.What strikes me most about the story is the innate believable premise, that window into the current and real world through a highly stylized fictional genre.  The process, just lightly detailed, that highlights the 'say anything to be elected' that plays on the fears of the electorate with little to no fact and the people who eat it up. Sadly, not a situation confined to the fictional world.What was best about this book? That it was both well written and easy to read without being 'dumbed down' for it's readers.  Not everything is laid out to decide how you should think about any of the situations, but allows you to make decisions and choices.  Certainly much of this is the genre, as a fan of paranormal fiction we are already inclined to have our own thoughts about the supernaturals ( although Arcane is the politically correct phrasing )and perhaps that grants a certain sympathy toward the introduction of the topics, which John Abramowicz does with a nice flair.  I'd like to see more of Hunter, to see just what he makes of the life and law practice in the aftermath of this particular story."
2013-02-22,B006BGZJJ4,5.0,USB Cable,A1XQ6O22WT8CYY,Works great and was inexpensive replacement for my original cable which really never did fit correctly.  I personally think the original cable had some issues.
2013-04-25,B006C36UXK,4.0,good book,ATCT1CPOGKEI4,I find the sisters in this series very fun to read. I am constantly waiting for the next book to come out. Love finding out the twist and turns of the characters in this series.
2014-06-8,B006FEABQS,5.0,Absolutely wonderful,A2QGPLGYWNTU1X,"What more can I say that hasn't been said by other reviews? This book was fabulous and I thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish. I have some more books by this author and will now move them to the top of my TBR pile (huge as it is). I tend to give a lot of 5 star reviews - but if I thoroughly a story and it takes me away from everything while reading, then to me that is the sign of a good book."
2013-12-16,B006GEQ24W,5.0,Interesting and exciting futuristic novel,A1NUE0J00E3UEP,"Govicide: Comply is great science fiction novel, a futuristic thriller with interesting themes and symbols that will definitely not leave you indifferent: politics, authority, conspiracy, history, future, romance and many others. It provides an important massage, while it makes you think about many questions related to authority that we face and our possible future.I would not like to reveal you the story, but I can assure that it&#8217;s a great one! It has an exciting plot, interesting characters, surprises and also a great ending.The story is well written, it is exiting and interesting, just as you expect from any good fiction novel and most important, it really draws you in. There is a wide mix of genres, which makes the reading even more interesting. It&#8217;s a great reading and I would recommend it to any science fiction and thriller fan."

The plot was clever and made me want to keep reading to find out what would happen next.  Although this book takes place in the future, it felt as if it were a future that related to the present we inhabit.  The political undertones make one hope that the U.S. is not headed full bore in to the path it takes in the book.  I'm going to read more books by this author."

2012-08-30,B006H4GBTM,5.0,A Love Story That is More Than a Story of Romance,ABB4W7IN43YO9,"Gold Mountain by JoMarie Lodge is a love story, but it's more than a love story. Lodge delves into Chinese American cultural relations in 1906 San Francisco. She immerses the reader into the vast differences in the lives of the white population and the Chinese population through the lives of Ruth Greer and Li Hanlin while demonstrating how people themselves tend to be very similar regardless of culture. When Ruth meets Hanlin, she feels an immediate attraction that leads her to look for reasons to return to the Li household. She becomes an English tutor for the Li family much to her father's dismay and confusion. Ruth's father works hard to separate her from Hanlin as Hanlin fights his attraction to Ruth. Lodge's exploration of the culture of Chinatown is at once interesting, engaging, and discomforting. Lodge pulls the reader into a world filled with drugs, sex, and violence seen from multiple angles. Her writing depicts the world in which the characters live without being gratuitously graphic. The characters populating the pages of Gold Mountain are as diverse as the people who populated San Francisco in 1906. Tragedy, bigotry, misconceptions, betrayal, loyalty, and love, both romantic and familial, travel through the pages of Gold Mountain taking the reader on a journey of survival, triumph, loss, and renewal that rings as relevant today as it did during the 1906 time period in which it was set. Lodge's words inspire the reader to look beyond the exterior to the individual's heart and soul before passing judgment."
2012-03-26,B006H4LJDU,5.0,Great Read!,A3RWLLIBAYWXV0,"This was a quick read but a great one! The story started of taking you in one direction and you assumed it would have the same old predictable ending like a lot Urban Fiction. But the plot thickened LITERALLY! Envie was a bit naive about her friend Kima and that ended up being her downfall as we figured but the way it was her downfall left my jaw dropped! I was intrigued from start to finish. I wanted more details since it got so very juicy at the very end so it leaves me to wonder if there will be a sequel! If so, I am definitely looking forward to it!"
2012-03-21,B006H6AOK2,3.0,Pretty much what you probably expect,A39I3A6HUG5ZVO,"It was ok - predictable, but somewhat entertaining as far as the writing style, etc. Except for some very detailed sexual romps, and fantasies, this could be added to the fairy tales you read to your kids, like Cinderella.The Love at first sight, the antics to fool everyone, the constant misunderstanding about what the other one means, thinks or feels ............. nothing really new or exciting.  It's ok - just not memorable."
2011-12-7,B006HH09SS,4.0,More favorite short stories,AUA8E8NYKC35S,"One Buck Horror Four: in short, well worth one buck for two five-star short stories.The intro story, ""Hanal Pixan,"" by Erath Juarez is a story where five kids hear their grandpa telling them ghost stories in front of their bonfire and altar in preparation for the ""Day of the Dead,"" festival. For an intro story, this was really disappointing. There were a couple frightening moments, but the style of a story being told to them drained the impact of the frightening parts. Also, the ending seemed more like a twist for the sake of having a twist than leaving me in a terrified state - which is what I'm used to from One Buck Horror. I'll give it 3 stars.The second story, ""Theridia,"" by Mark Onspaugh, is about an older brother going to find out why his younger brother didn't go stake their claim at a silver mine like he said, but instead is staying in the town of Rusty Saw. He goes to find out why, and soon determines he needs to stay as well. Will he let his brother have what now draws them both to stay? This was a good story, 4 stars. Despite a first line I thought could have been cleared up a little, I'm glad I read on.Looks like an upward trend for the first three stories as the third is a 5 star tale. ""Walter's Friends,"" by Nick A. Zaino III is a well rounded story with the right ending. To save from spoilers, I'll just say I was impressed with the writing, the world-building, the twist on the genre, and the character arc from beginning to end. I'll keep my eye on Nick for future stories.The fourth story, ""Bayani's Promise,"" by M.R. Jordan, keeps the momentum with another 5 star tale. I particularly liked this one because it reminded me of my honeymoon in Cozumel, and how I sensed a whole other world beyond the tourist areas. This story captures what life would be like beyond the tourist centers when life is about pure survival. What awaits both in the dark and at home are some pretty horrifying revelations. This was well written and had enough twists and turns to keep me engaged and leave me satisfied.The last story, ""In the Eye of the Beholder,"" by Kristine Ong Muslim, is a 4 star with an interesting twist that left me disturbed. Classic One Buck Horror. It's not a 5 star because some of the details didn't line up in my mind. Saying anything else would ruin the story.Total Score: 4.2 StarsTo be honest, I can see how the second and last story could be a 5 star for someone else. This would push it up to a 4.6"

I enjoy snapping up your works for .99, but Rollins and Brown and others whom I enjoy are selling for 7.99 and 14.95.I am only halfway through Vector Borne, but enjoy it as much as Burial Ground. Seeing your background, I understand how you can go on with 'toothmarks on the third occipital lobe, dried blood drooling' for page after page, recommend condensing for those of us with weak stomachs. Your research into lost cultures adds considerable credibility to the story line.Your prose and presentation are polished, you are ready for the big time. Aside from a few minor glitches, 'of' instead of 'to' in places, the grandiloquence of your storytelling limns itself into the ebon recesses of my psyche. Uh, sorry about that."

2014-07-9,B006KDUPH4,3.0,Donovan's Angel,A3HEG0QCOK446R,Sweet and funny story.  Its part of a series though and I didn't wanna spend the money to read the rest of them.  You would think if they are going to be writing books in a series they would be inexpensive if you want your readers to read them all right?  3.99 is a bit much to me and some of the books were 3.99.  Enjoyed the story though for being free.  I looked up the rest and found out they were out of my price range so I had to pass.

He's seen a lot, he's done a lot and he's got a story to tell.  Not the story our dear interviewer is looking for, but it's one she won't forget!The telling of this thriller is as fast and concise as it is gripping and unique.  It's a really quick read that is hard to put down.  At a mere glimpse, you're fully introduced to characters you can easily cast in the movie version in your mind.  The author doesn't waste time pulling you into the scene and getting you almost comfortable in the company of a lunatic.  The writing style is easy to enjoy and I really love how the story, instead of being led by the interviewer, is led by the interviewee and allows you that much more creepy goodness!"

This novel is somewhat like Stephen King's &#34;Carrie&#34;.I found it to be very interesting. I think YA girls will like it very much. It has a good plot and I think it will make a reasonable person think about bullying, and why kids bully others. This is a dilemna that is way to common with young people these days. We need to do everything we can to stop bullies and anyone who uses their strength or power to harm or intimidate those who are weaker.

2013-12-16,B006MLKZWO,5.0,Excellent addition to series,A2FOQS9I8RI0V6,"4.5*Book source ~ PurchasedSarah Pringle was a school teacher until her nasty brother gets involved with the Kurjans. When one of them kills an employee at their pharmaceutical company right in front of her she thinks they are vampires, but the police don&#8217;t believe her and her brother has her committed to a mental institution for evaluation. When she manages to escape and put up a blog about the vampire she witnessed killing a woman this brings her to the attention of the actual vampires, the Dark Protectors. It&#8217;s time for damage control, so the vampire King of the Realm, Dage Kayrs, sends his best hunter, Max Petrovsky, to find Sarah and take care of the problem.Max is the biggest, baddest, fiercest hunter Dage has and most would say his heart is made of stone, but he doesn&#8217;t stand a chance against the four-year-old he needs to guard. Max discovers he actually has a heart when he has to spend a good amount of time guarding Janie, so it&#8217;s not such a huge surprise when he meets Sarah that there is room for her there, too. Max is an awesome alpha hero with kick ass fighting skills and a great match for Sarah who couldn&#8217;t really fight her way out of a wet paper bag though she is stubborn and full to the brim with perseverance. The chemistry between the two is steamy, the plot is good, the characters wonderful and there is humor sprinkled throughout. I&#8217;ve enjoyed each book in this series so far and this one, while short, doesn&#8217;t disappoint."
2012-06-23,B006N9WIIE,2.0,OK for a $2.99 book,A3U7DBAFW5XT7B,"OK:  It's not bad for a summer read.  Yes, there are a ton of ""borrowed"" concepts from other sci-fi writers that either aren't developed with any original thought or are simply treated as formulaic necessities.  There is also a level of cliche' that gets really old really fast - how many times am I going to read ""She filled out her uniform nicely?""  And while Smith avoids the gratuitous sex so many writers fall prey to, his inability to create a female character without really sophomoric stereotypes also gets old - some of his scenes read like a 10th grader's private dream of three-somes or harems.  If I had paid more than $3 bucks for it, I'd probably feel totally cheated but for summer reading that's pretty mindless, it's not bad.  It's also just not really good."

The bodies she assumes are those of individuals who are in some kind of difficulty. Apparently, she is quite good at adjusting to the problem and finding a solution and this is the reason for her continued wandering among the mortals.In her ministerial duties she is aided by Will, an ethereal `mentor' who provides a certain amount of basic material to aid in her endeavors. In this particular episode, Abby finds herself in a man's body necessitating some adjustments and the need to learn new simple manly routines.As in the first of the series, the story moves along at a nice pace with a simple but credible plot and acceptable characters. Young male readers may notice that the directions for tying a tie apply only if one is left handed and that one does not usually shave after putting on a tie. Generally, however, the male presentation is  well handled and once again, Kelly Green has provided a tale that young adults should enjoy.  Reviewed by John H.

2012-06-22,B006OOSWRO,3.0,Short and sweet.,A2MHCZISNWHQFR,"I bought the book for two reasons: it's free, and the reviews are great. I'm glad I checked it out. Though it's very short (I finished it in two hours), I still enjoyed it. The author claims he tried to do something fresh with the concept, but I didn't see anything new. A zombie story is a zombie story. The only fresh take I've ever seen on the concept is ""Xombies."" Those zombies don't eat people, and that's pretty cool. This is just a story about a man getting to his family (seen that a thousand times) during a zombie apocalypse. A fun read, but absolutely nothing new."

The zombie apocalypse continues to allow the crazy's to come out of the wood work, not sure how they manage but they do. Now it is up to Laura to keep the family together. She's powered by adrenaline, grief, Oxycontin and the fundamental instinct to protect her children. Wise believes that women characters are, more often that not, not portrayed as real women probably would be in these situations. I find it very refreshing when a strong willed stand alone female protagonists hit my ear, there should be more.

2012-06-20,B006PI0NRG,5.0,Epic fantasy and history woven together.,AD31RYVD1EJ2D,"I had a wonderful time reading ""The Bones of the Earth"" by Scott Bury.The story of young Javor is fascinating. It unfolds smoothly and beautifully, with its ring of authentic surroundings of ancient Europe's strange customs and believes. The Slavic mythology is rare in general fiction (vampires aside) and well researched novels on this subject are next to non-existent. So, aside from a good story, ""The Bones of the Earth"" is standing out on that score too.The opening chapter sucked me right in, promptly followed by an outpour of action. The quest of Javor is difficult and breathtaking. Without aspiring to this, the youth is turning into a warrior and the way the author presented his ""journey"" is realistic and believable. I kept turning pages, fascinated, wishing to know what will happen next.I hope Scott Bury will bring us more of these fascinating, but greatly overlooked, parts of history and culture, presented in more of his smoothly flowing, fast-pacing stories."

Thankyou very much!My checklist suggested that the story would be fascinating, quirky, ironical and just plain old interesting and yes, I am very happy to report that it lived up to its promises.  The ending while sudden has left me wanting more and I am in a quandary as to whether I should wait for the whole story to be published together (probably more satisfying) or just play the waiting game for short periods between each episode. The only thing I am sad about is the product description is probably more accurate for the whole story not just this book, as episode 1 does not include any mention of the CIA or Homeland Security.  I can only guess they make an appearance in later episodes.Happy to give four stars for I really liked it."
2014-05-29,B006RNBI6O,4.0,Riveting,A2383ST7WVN6AE,This book was a real page turner and had me staying up late to find out what was going to happen next.  I liked the characters and how they related to one another.  I just purchased the next book in the series and am ready to read it!

The author does a great job in description of characters, scenery, buildings, ect. without it being two paragraphs or more. This book has great mature content that doesnt make the book childish. This book has a huge cliffhanger ending that makes you really want to keep reading! Cant wait for the next volume! I enjoyed reading this book and will be recommending it."

They are so close to story lines it's not even funny, the only big difference is that this one is with wolves were as the other series is about vampires. Still a decent start to a new series will be interested how the other books are done. Hopefully a little better, because as the story went on it seemed to get more rushed in the telling ."

It was about Rebecca who had psychic skills and coerced to use her skills to save a possible assassination of potential Presidential candidate. Her love interest, Kelly, also possessed psychic powers and it sounded like he had loved her even in a previous life.

The dialogue enhances the book, but it is the ecstatically hot sex that moves Undone Rebel from a good sexy book to an outstanding erotic.

2012-02-15,B006Y8LLVY,4.0,Definitely Vittorio's Woman!!,A1BE3BUP5AU62J,"Story DescriptionSimon Vittorio was determined to make Lilly his woman from the moment he first laid eyes on her. But when a car accident leaves him paralyzed, he falls into a dark depression and loses all hope of sharing a life together. When Lilly is hired as his physical therapist, he is ashamed to have her see him so weak and helpless, and employs every trick in the book to drive her away.Regardless of Simon's fierce temper and sharp tongue, Lilly refuses to let him bully her into leaving. Not just because she believes she can help Simon walk again, but because she is hopelessly in love with himMy ThoughtsAlthough this book was downloaded on my Kindle as a free read, I was looking forward to reading it because of the story description.At the beginning of the story, you realize that Lilly has met Simon before his accident, but never had the opportunity to speak with him. She did feel an instant connection with him, but was shy and afraid that he would not be interested in her, because he was handsome and could have any woman that he wanted.She still feels an attraction, and hopes that she can keep a professional attitude.Although Simon, who is unable to see at the time Lilly arrives at his home as his physical therapist, he recognizes her as the woman that he met at the club, that he felt himself being drawn too, but was unable to speak with her because she ran out.He also still feels an attraction, but feels less of a man, and wants to get rid of her.This book was well written, however, I felt like the relationship with Lilly and Simon was still a bit rushed.  They went from avoidance of one another to in bed with another before the week was over.  I would have liked to see them take a little longer to come to terms with their feelings for one another.There is also a secondary relationship in this book, and I would have liked to read more on their back story and future.  Hopefully, they will get their own separate story (I won't spoil who this couple is).Overall, the book was a good read, and I would like to read more from this author."
2012-02-3,B006YHTV1M,4.0,"BUY, READ, ENJOY!",A1E3QC0C1ODF2N,"I debated with myself over buying this novella. I do not understand why there is not an approx page count on a lot of the Kindle items for sell. (Have been disappointed a few times in the length vs money spent.)However, I was not disappointed in this purchase. Other reviews have given a review of the story much better than I can so after my above rant, just let me say:  Buy, read, and enjoy, I did and it was well worth the price or even more.  I do not think you will be disappointed either."
2013-02-3,B006Z0KYEQ,5.0,Engrossing thriller,A1LO8T8LUIEKTQ,"When I first got this e-book, there were only a few reviews; all of them 5 stars.  Of course, I was immediately suspicious about that...must be friends, or people who got a free book, or paid reviewers.  Now that I've read it, I can say that I'm not the author's friend, nor did I get paid for this;  and yes indeedy, I have joined the 5 star club....FIVE STARS, absolutely!  This fulfills my definition of a ""thriller"" in that it goes into a chase for the bad guys that doesn't let up until the end.  What makes this book different is that the characters are not cardboard cliches; they are complex and flawed, and they each are drawn with such distinct individuality that brings the reader closer to them.  Getting towards the end, I would stop reading every few pages, hoping the ""good guys"" would win, yet afraid of what was going to happen.  This book completely absorbed me for a few days, and I was sad to get to that end. (Now waiting patiently for the author's next book.)"

2012-11-10,B0072Z3800,5.0,Nice book to have on my Kindle Fire.,A3L99QA1E6JWQ4,"I enjoyed reading this book. Although it did address some things I had prior knowledge of, I did still learn some new things from this book. After a neighbor and I got into a discussion about her eating Dandelion Greens awhile back I became curious about trying them myself. This book discusses Dandelions and provides detailed information about consumption, health benefits, and nutritional content that I found very helpful. By the way my neighbor is in her 70's and does not look a day over 50. She also eats plenty of fruits and vegetables from her garden but after reading information in this book about Dandelions I suspect that eating them may play a role in her health and vibrancy for her age. I also found the other supplement information helpful. I really like a lot of the recipes. As far as the sugar content one could use substitutes such as Stevia, raw honey, etc. All in all I would recommend this book and think it is worth the price."

2012-10-23,B00742JQJ8,4.0,Might Have Been Better as a Novella Instead of a Short Story,AU510CVD9XDG,"Without getting into spoilers, this was a intriguing story.  More of a Hitchcock Thriller than horror, but that takes nothing away from the story.  My only issue is that the lead character makes assumptions and accepts them too quickly. The story needed more proofs of what was really going on.  Not necessarily an explanation but enough data to actually come up with a theory.  I think if the author expanded the story a bit and delayed his epiphany it would have been a five.  Even with the above criticism, it is still a good read.edited for duplicate sentence."

2012-07-31,B00770DHGK,4.0,Inspiring relationship,A2JLK1SQ8O03EO,"I greatly enjoy gay-themed Regency stories, but confess to a certain amount of unease about this one, due to the fact that it's a bit darker in tone than many of the historical novels that I read. You could say that this book puts on display the seedy underbelly of the times in a way that Georgette Heyer never would.With themes involving laudanum addiction and child abuse, there's no doubt that this book touches on problems never mentioned in lighter historical fare. But at the same time the story is not all doom and gloom; not by a long shot. The sad and unhappy aspects of the plot are more than counterbalanced by the unfolding relationship between Michael and Wes. Here we have two very damaged individuals who find in each other a reason to go on. They bring out the best in each other, and their growing attraction, turning to love, gives them strength and enables them to fight their personal demons and become better people because of it. And isn't this an uplifting example of what the best romantic relationships may offer?There is some unpleasant content here, but the positive aspects of the tale were quite uplifting and rest assured that things end well for the pair. However, I did have a few questions at the end; now let's see, what can I say without giving away any key plot points....Michael and Wes end up in an ideal situation, but one that perhaps isn't perpetually sustainable given the constraints of the time period. I'd like to see how, as time passed by, they managed to continue to live as a couple while still fitting into society. It's true enough that there was a great deal of hypocrisy among the aristocracy in 19th century England. Wait, that's true of every society in every time period! But what I'm saying is that the upper class could get by with behavior that might flout the conventional societal moral norms of the time, as long as the individuals were discreet and didn't focus undue attention upon themselves. It really was possible for two men to have a serious committed romantic relationship in this society (even 200 years ago). But to do so they would have to have a logical and innocuous reason to spend a lot of time in each other's company, or live in the same house. And I wanted to know how the two protagonists pulled this off after the story concluded.Also, I have to wonder about the fate of the Westin family after the shattering events that engulfed them. (I should note this scandal was NOT due to anything that Wes did!) Could the family, no matter how well-connected and powerful, continue to take their place, and have an influence, in polite society? Or would they have to start afresh in some other country, perhaps on the continent or even America? I simply don't know how this would have played out in Regency England.But my questions didn't adversely affect my feelings about the story. This is a book that I grew to like even more after I had read it, and thought about it a bit. I suppose I was rather uncomfortable with a few of the plot twists as I was in the process of reading, and only upon reflection did my feelings shift a little. I'll recommend this one to those who enjoy Regencies with gay characters. I haven't read any of the author's other works as of yet, but I liked this one well enough that I'm certainly willing to try some of her other books."

2012-06-4,B0078XGUZQ,4.0,Blooded - Jessica McClain series novella,ABUMPJ5RJ4GJ1,"My soul, imagine being the only female born to an all male werewolf pack.  I thought growing up with 5 brothers was bad enough.  Poor Jessica!This novella is an introduction to the new Jessica McClain series by Amanda Carlson.  It nicely sets the stage for the full-length novel coming out in Fall 2012.  Overall, the novella gives us a good description of the main character, Jessica, and an understanding of how her upbringing and struggles made her who she is now.The author has given life to a fierce and uncompromising society of werewolves where Jessica McClain was not supposed to exist.  In this world, there are no females born of werewolf fathers. Until Jessica.  Most in the Pack feared her and some even thought she was the prophesied one spoken of in the `Cain Myth' (the true Daughter of Evil would eventually destroy the entire werewolf race). That fear was smoldering to a point where Jessica's life is at risk.At the very beginning of the novella, we are thrust into the violent world in which Jessica lives.  With Jessica constantly fighting for her life, the tone is somewhat dark. However, the author convincingly offsets the tension with Jessica's keen sense of humor.The pace rises and falls nicely where it's supposed to and it flows effortlessly from scene to scene.I admit I am a big fan of novellas. It's incredibly difficult to create a good backstory, develop characters and establish an interesting plot in such a limited amount of pages.  A lot of authors will end up overwhelming readers with too much detail or underwhelming them with too few.  It's hard to get the balance just right.  I think it's a true test of an author's skill to communicate all we need to know and successfully deliver a well-structured story.  Amanda Carlson is one of those skilled authors.What I particularly liked about this novella (and this series) is the author's ability to interlace a new take on werewolf culture with a strong social message about self-preservation and how far a person is willing to go to survive.If you enjoy urban fantasy series like Sabina Kane by Jaye Wells or Chicagoland Vampires by Chloe Neill, then I think you'll like this series.  The heroines of these series are similar in that their will to survive is what motivates them to do whatever it takes to overcome major conflicts/obstacles thrown in their way.________________________________________Just a bit more about the story...Considered an abomination and a genetic freak of nature, Jessica has had to fight pretty much every day of her life.  Even though she is the daughter of the Pack leader, even he couldn't protect her all of the time.  While the wolves listened and respected their leader, if fear and emotions got the better of them, they would most likely kill her regardless of the possibility of losing their lives.With the threats becoming more frequent and escalating in aggression, Jessica finally decides to take matters into her own hands.  She challenges a member of the Pack, albeit one she thinks she has a chance to beat, to a fight.  Mitch was only too happy to oblige.  Plan A for her was to beat him senseless and then the others would back off.  At least to give her some breathing room.Relying on her sparring skills learned from her brother, her wits and her knowledge of werewolf weaknesses, Jessica thinks she can win.  If her plan fails and the threats continue, she has a Plan B.  To leave home and go away to start a new life where no one would know her.  Her father is strongly opposed to letting her go, fearing she would be killed without his protection.  What he doesn't realize is that she is in just as much danger, if not more, by staying.________________________________________The Characterization...Jessica is a character that immediately brought out my protective side.  Yes, she's absolutely fearless and tough and can handle herself, but she is basically scratching to stay alive by staying at the Compound.  I hated seeing her get hurt and I wanted to jump right into that novel and help her in that fight.  She would only end up protecting me and saving my butt, but that's beside the point... The author still brilliantly made me feel that way.Even though this first novella is all about Jessica and developing her character, we were introduced to a few others who will probably play a part in novels to come. She was close to her twin brother, her brother's friend Nick, and there was also a very flirtatious Brit that would make life interesting if she sticks around.There are only a couple of things that led to my 4 Bad Boy rating instead of a 5.  I would have loved to hear a little more about what motivated the other characters.  For instance, why is Nick willing to go away with her if she goes?  How did that come about?  Why was her father so insanely stubborn about her not moving away?  Jessica must have had a mother but there was no mention of her.  What happened to her?  These questions may be answered later in the series so their absence in no way takes away from the fact that Blooded is still a fascinating novella and one this reviewer is very glad to have read.________________________________________Bottom LineIn my opinion, Amanda Carlson gives us a new take on werewolf culture.  Blooded is a well-structured novella that nicely sets up the story world and I was completely absorbed and rooting for Jessica from Page 1.  The story is action-packed with a pace and tone that makes sense for the story.  The tone can be a bit serious or intense at times, however, the author incorporates light-heartedness through Jessica's unique sense of humor.  I recommend reading it and can't wait for Book #1, Full Blooded, to be released in September.Happy Reading!!4 Stars - Really Enjoyed It!!!!"
2012-02-22,B007A4WT7Q,5.0,Loved it!,A14DA24GGS7PUG,"Eighteen year old Jamie has been on the run for four years, moving from one foster home to another trying to avoid being found by Sirus; the murderer of her family and entire pack, but he always seems to be just one step behind her, getting closer and closer leaving her unable to feel safe. There is a turf war starting and Jaime's bloodline is sought after, as the time gets nearer to her first `wolf moon' (coming of age) Jaime senses that Sirus isn't the only wolf on her trail.  Danger is all around her and Jaime knows now it's more important than ever that she gets her revenge and kills him before he does as he threatened and takes her as his `lifemate' to ensure his Alpha status over her old territory.I loved the fact that Jaime wasn't at any point a push over, she didn't swoon at Sirus' feet in an unnatural sudden turn from hate to love and just because `he' wanted her it didn't change the fact that; as her wolf instincts dictated, she would only end up mating with the strongest Alpha, the one who proved himself, the one who managed to catch her....even if that ended up being one of the others in the chase.This is the second book in the Wolves of Black River series. Both books have ended and we haven't been left with a cliff hanger in either, although characters from `Mark of the wolf' are in this book, they are both separate stories. This is the type of series I enjoy (I hate cliff hangers with a passion!)Blood of the wolf is fast paced and full of action with plenty of passion and lust. The lack of romance between our two main characters gave a realistic feel to their relationship and it was an interesting change to the norm for a `love' story.T.L Shreffler definitely has a writing style that I love to read and the ability to draw me into her world with an ease that I don't find often. Her descriptions of fight scenes had me holding my breath with tension and able to visualise every bite and every drop of blood spilt. She managed to find the balance that so many other writers don't achieve in their work, scenes were neither over written nor understated and I enjoyed every page. I was eager to reach the end to learn the outcome but at the same time I was sad for the story to be over.I am really looking forward to reading more work by this very talented new author."

2012-05-30,B007BEDR4Y,4.0,good but not as good as the first,AYIRSM2MDKEUU,"I liked it, but not as much as the first season. Ed is my favorite character, who is hardly in this the second season, I expect he'll be more prevalent in the upcoming episodes because well who's left. My only real complaint is why did I spend all this time reading about people not involved in the end game.  It feels sorta like George r r martin with the way some of the characters get killed off, which is annoying to me at least.  It is still interesting and Bororicio is hilarious, I didn't particularly like the ending but am still looking forward to where the authors are going with the story.  Overall still a very entertaining read and would recommend this series to others."

2013-08-22,B007C4IAKO,5.0,Great Series!!,A2QM11CAVEENBO,"This is the first trilogy of a great series of books! If you're a lover of science fiction these are a must have! I don't want to give too much away, but its the typical aliens invade earth plot, but It has some interesting, creative and original plot devices. The characters are all easy to relate to, and fully fleshed out. It's a fun series to follow and I enjoyed watching all of the characters grow and evolve throughout the series All in all I would recommend these to anyone!! Battle Earth: The First Trilogy is AMAZING!!! LOVE THIS SERIES!!!!!"
2012-12-30,B007CKQ2KS,5.0,Until The Sun Falls From The Sky by Kristen Ashley,A3AXMI34CKM714,"It's no secret that I'm a huge Kirsten Ashley fan. In fact I'm such a big fan of her's, that I want to actually live inside her head and just bask in the glory of having her amazing tales swirl past me every moment of each day.Yes... I'm a scary huge fan of her books and hey... my reason for that is absolutely justified. She's amazing in any single tale she tells... well except for Breathe, which I wasn't a huge fan of and even then... it wasn't the story, it was the female character that drove me nuts. But back the the fact that on my list... she has a 99.9% brilliant book rating and Until The Sun Falls From The Sky is no exception.All her book's I read in the past are based on everyday characters, like you and me (lol)... But this is the first of her books I've read that has a fantasy / paranormal twist to it and I was a little worried that it wouldn't have my perfect, adorable alpha males, I've come to EXPECT from Kristen Ashley... but ladies... it has all that and so much more... it has... drum-roll... Lucien... forget Christian Grey, Forget Gideon Cross, Forget Edward Cullen... forget about them all, this very minute and let me introduce you to Lucien... who is simply just called that... Lucien. Hot, Fierce, Seriously Masculine, a Big Beautifully Built Man and... a Vampire! Gasp! It doesn't get any better than that combination.I was having a such a dry spell from books that I honestly couldn't find a book that gripped me. I had begun to read 4 books and simply couldn't make my way through them and then... Until The Sun Falls From The Sky came up next on my Kindle and I was like ""Eh... let me give it a try because if nothing else... it's Kristen"" so I did and I'm so happy to say I wasn't broken... I just needed something amazing to read and oh boy did I have an ah-ma-zing time doing it.""I'm taking my mortal as my mate. You love me, I love you, we're connected, what we have is beautiful and that's all it'll ever be. For eternity. Until the end of days. Until the sun falls from the sky, all you and I will share is beauty.""The only reason I'm not giving it a perfectly bright 5 stars is only because I wanted to know more. In fact, it maybe would have been better if the book didn't spend to much time seriously working my emotions up all the way to the top and then just dropping it like a hot potato. It did that for a while before you finally got what you wanted from the get go. That was honestly frustrating but well worth the wait in the end.I'm really hoping that the next books in the series incorporate Leah and Lucien because there are many unanswered questions and situations that I will need another book about just the two of them brought out to explain.In essence... this books was so brilliant that I'm tempted to just start all over again. I seriously cannot wait to start the next part... which BTW I'm doing right now... bye!Read More Reviews On My Blog - Coffee, Books & Lipgloss"
2013-10-2,B007D3XHB6,5.0,A Reading the Paranormal Review,A1UH21GLZTYYR5,"Holy crumb, this book was emotionally wrenching. Is it just me or does the thought of two people lingering for TWO HUNDRED years without one another hurt? That Salathiel really did a number on poor Nayara and Ryan. Shattering the trust of your menage by attempting to destroy life as we know it isn't something that's easy to get past.Seriously, I'm still a little flaily. Nayara and Ryan have all this history together. Six hundred years as lovers and two hundred as lost souls. That's a lot of anniversaries. The twist of fate that gives vampires crystal clear memories makes it hard for them to get past what they had to do to right the wrongs Salathiel caused. Good thing they have a hard-headed human on their side who's willing to force them to see what they're doing to one another.And good thing that Stelios has a thing for both Nayara and Ryan. It makes menaging so much more fun when all three are into one another.This book gives us more layers to the vampire world, more naughty sexy times with three powerful people, and one bad guy who is a very real threat. Time travel, vampires, and menages. Oh, my!(Yes, I'm still totally on board with the idea of time traveling vampire menages. We need more books like this. MOAR!)-Kelly @ Reading the Paranormal"
2012-04-20,B007D8TLP2,4.0,Unsettling and enjoyable twisted together in one tale!,A2RNB80ES0QRQO,The title says it all.  What could be worse than the horrors a family hides from their friends and neighbors?  This short story is well written and disturbing to read.  The family is the heart of true horror and this story captures that truth in a most awesome way!
2012-11-6,B007D9UW22,5.0,Natural way to put out the fire,AYVQRBM2SO7B6,"This book is a simple read filled with very good info on how to treat heartburn. I like how the author gives you two options on treating this problem.One is through traditional medicines and some everyday use products that one can find in their fridge, like baking soda. Second he explains how one can use natural remedies such as licorice chewing gum, and ginger root to stop heartburn. Over all this e-book is very helpful and informative and it does specify that this problem is mainly the result of your diet. I recommend this book to anyone who has ever suffered heartburn or loves to eat spicy foods."

2012-03-6,B007EEF3TS,4.0,The Wright Platt Ending,A273D8IJXEBVSB,"As a fan of good stories, be they YA or whatever, I must say that this story left me yearning for the next episode just as the Yesterday's Gone stories always did. They are the authors' signature and it's what they do best.It did take me a while to get into Noella(the only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5), but once the scene went down in Keefer's, I was hooked. Very excited to see what evolves from Dante (whether you like the name or not...Edward isn't exactly a stellar name, but he certainly made it sparkle:)) and how he measures up to the idea that has built in my head already.ForNeverMore has already promised to pack a mean punch (especially with descriptions like ""He's LOVED her all his LIVES""). So...it's Tuesday and I'm ready for my serving of HOT and my next WTH ending!YA fan or not...you know you love cliffhangers and a good story:)"

I so pleased I got a hold of this book and never simply past on by. Its even suitable for Diabetics too . A whole package deal in here.Food can actully become a problem to us as well, that has developed over a season of time, while covering up deeper , unresolved issues and honestly I wasnt disappointed. Dr. Jay has a way of cutting to the core of  problems and then showing ways to resolve it. Its a challenge that Im definatley willing to give my best try, you should be willing to go ahead and read up on all he says too before saying, oh no! here we go again...... thanks Dr. Jay you got my attention here."

I almost did not buy this book, because of the other reviewer.  I would have missed meeting Gilbert and his caring mates.  Gilbert had a hard life and that is not something a person can just forget and move on from.  I really liked that the characters discussed their problems and tried to solve them together.  All in all a enjoyable read."

2012-06-15,B007GO364K,3.0,Just OK,A1B10YHJ3VQ1BJ,"This book was just OK.  Not that great but not bad either.  I finished the book, and mostly enjoyed it while I read it.  But really, when I was done, I had to admit I wouldn't miss the story or characters one bit.Now there were some good points.  For example, the author creates a civilization in which the tribe is the basic organizing social structure.  Not only are tribes the basis around which towns/cities are built, but they also dramatically affect the cultural norms by which the members live.  We see tribes that are matriarchal, tribes that are essentially hunter-gatherers, tribes that are religious based, etc., etc.  Overall, I found this to be an interesting feature; albeit unrealistic that all these tribes would live in very close proximity for a thousand years and have virtually no knowledge/understanding of each other.The story itself is fairly interesting:  it tells the story of the good guy main character, who of course is unknowingly more than he seems, as he rises to greatness leading the good tribes against all that is evil.  Along the way there is the obligatory meeting of his soul mate and resulting insta-love.  This romantic element, however, wasn't the focus of the book and didn't overwhelm the story.My main criticisms were:1) I thought the characters were two dimensional at best.  The main character is helped in his journey to greatness by 3 secondary characters.  None of these secondary characters were fully developed, in my opinion.  Now one character is meant to be somewhat mysterious, I get that.  Nevertheless, since this particular character is instrumental in the development of the main character, I really would have expected more insight into his background and motivations.  The main character's love interest as well didn't get fully fleshed out.  She, in particular, had an interesting experience during the book that could have been more fully told.2) My second problem had to do with the muddled theology in the book.  There are apparently evil spirits and what appear to be fallen angel-like creatures, there are apparently good-guy angel-like creatures, there appears to be a good god, and there appears to be a satan-like creature.  Now I used the word ""appears"" in all of those previous phrases because none of this is very well explained.  Since this ""war"" between the good god/angels and bad god/angels is the main impetus of the story, the muddled presentation of all of this was very unsatisfying.  In the end, for me, it dramatically increased my level of impatience with the story.3) I thought the combat descriptions were either confusingly written or the author doesn't really have a good feel for what this sort of medieval-level of war fighting would be like.  It got a little tiring reading about every other character wielding their sword/axe in circles and mowing down dozens of opponents at a time.  Yet that's the kind of battle description we repeatedly received.  No mention of a shield wall, formations, tactics, etc.  And I won't even bring up the author's idea of good tactics being that a city garrison, outnumbered 2 or 3 to one, particularly in cavalry, would choose to confront this overwhelmingly superior force outside the city walls on the open battlefield (OK, I lied and brought it up anyway).4) Lastly, I got tired of the main character being ""too good"".  He has no flaws.  He's good looking.  He is always good natured.  He is super intelligent.  He is always diplomatic.  He is the bravest one around.  His prowess in combat is unequalled.  Although he's just a farm boy, he gets the noble girl.  Add to all of that the magical blessings that make his armor impenetrable and the magic from his sword unstoppable and the main character, for me, became just another boring Mary Sue.Now even with all of those shortcomings I found in the book, the book was mostly entertaining.  I'm not sorry I bought it.  But when the sequel comes out, I won't be buying it."

Does this peak your curiosity?...In town checking on reports that one of their foremen was abusing power and ignoring responsibilities, Jared looked around at the late-night bar customers scouting for Stone Construction employees. Spotting some likely candidates, he moved to better listen in on their unguarded conversations. They might reveal important information he wouldn't get on the job site tomorrow.Distracted by a fight that seemed to be brewing among the men, Jared barely noticed the flannel shirt clad whirlwind who accepted the baseball bat handed over by the bartender.  The bat wielder headed for the crew.Will...oh.  James. Jared slowed his approach at the revelation that his foreman was apparently a woman.Willow James deftly disbanded the group, but not before receiving a punch for her efforts. Taking her split-lipped face back to the bartender where she returned the bat and paid for the property damage, she disappeared back into the night.Tomorrow looked to be the beginning of a potentially hellish week or two...Kathi S Barton combines romance, bits of humor, and danger in this story where Willow and Jared battle their attraction for each other as the tension and danger of illegal drugs and a murder complicate the situation. This author never ceases to delight her readers."
2013-09-5,B007HBH9L8,5.0,"...And Complete The Mission, Though I Alone Survive",A2LR03AY7BLCWS,"The first chapter of the free sample was enough, and I bought the book. Though a stand-alone novel, it is also a very satisfying companion piece to 'The Old Man and The Wasteland (TOMATW)'.  Superlatively well-written and well-edited, it is practically error-free and a genuine pleasure to read.The characters are well developed, and the story moves fast and held my interest throughout.  There are no continuity, internal consistency, or suspension of disbelief issues.  It's a real page-turner; it's a helluva of a good read.You won't be sorry.It is a tale of duty, honor, courage, loyalty, love, revenge, and perserverance set in the richly drawn, post apocalyptic world of 'TOMATW'.  It provides a broader look at that world, and provides more backstory on how that world came to be.The Boy is seventeen when we meet him; SSgt Presley - the sole survivor of a long-range reconnaisance squad - rescued him as a child, raised him as his son, and trained him to operate, survive, and thrive in the grim reality of world as it now is.Assisted by The Boy, SSgt Presley continued to carry out his orders and conduct his reconnaisance even though he knew it would mean his death by radiation poisoning.  We never get to meet SSgt Presley in life; rather we come to know him through The Boy's memories and recollections and applications of SSgt Presley's lessons.  Upon SSgt Presley's demise, The Boy's love for him motivates him to continue the mission.The Author hints that there might be more to come in the world of 'TOMATW'; I hope there is - I'll buy it."
2012-03-9,B007IE0BXC,5.0,The White Knight by Josh Lanyon,A1E481YU3ZPK6S,"The Dark Horse was the first book I read by Josh Lanyon... yes I know, I haven't read the Adrien Mysteries series, at least not from the beginning, and I know that is wonderful, too many people keep saying it to me, but at the time, I was more hooked by that story on a movie star and the detective who helps him against a crazy stalker. Probably I was expecting hot sex behind the scenes and the usual media scandals, maybe even the classical Hollywood scene of the red carpet where finally the actor admits his love for a man... and instead I found a couple in the aftermath of something huge, the stalker is already dead, the two heroes started a not simple relationship, and apparently Sean, the actor, is becoming crazy, if he wasn't yet crazy even before.In the previous book we discovered that Sean is not imagining things and that there is another stalker in his life, someone he would never suspect. Dan again becomes his hero, but at the same time he is his worst enemy: Dan is not accepting that Sean is playing the role of the perfect balanced man. Sean has problems, bigger ones, he is in denial; he faces them in his own way, forcing himself to accept things that his mind is trying to refusing, like sex with a man, and running away when faced with the true.The second book starts with Sean who is another time in danger, but this time he is far from Dan... he ran away, as usual, with the excuse to filming a movie in Galles. Even if before leaving he played the role of the lover who couldn't understand why Dan wasn't accepting, it's quite obvious that it was the perfect chance for Sean to not face again the truth; it was unthinkable for Dan to leave his work for more than three months, and Sean made everything possible to put Dan in front of an accomplished fact. Now in Galles Sean was victim of an accident, or maybe of an attempt murder, and he lost his recent memory; the only thing he remembers is that he loves Dan and he wants him near him, and Dan arrives, without questions or delaying.Sean is again all sweetness and words of undying love, but Dan this time doesn't buy it all; I like this double face of Dan, strong an unyielding in front of Sean, wanting from him to admit his mistakes and take measures for them, but at the same time protective and gentle, never leaving him alone. One of the fault I probably found in the previous book was that Sean and Dan's outside images were sometime stronger than their private side: this was maybe the reason why I felt the need to read something more on how they met and fell in love, and the reason for why they decided to live together. The second book fills completely that void, giving to Sean and Dan's feelings and reasons a main role, and letting the mystery in the background, almost nonexistent.During Sean's recovery, he replays in his mind two different timeline of his life with Dan: their first moment together, before the events that took place in book 1, and the aftermath of that book, when they tested their living together and Sean's inability to admit that he needed help. Don't get me wrong, it seems quite like Dan is the perfect knight in shining armor and Sean a shrinking violet who needs a shrink (pun intended); it's not exactly like that, Sean has only had very bad and negative experience with the doctor professional category and he needs time to trust them again. Dan on the other side is the perfect partner, supportive and attentive, with the right dose of protectiveness; maybe he should have more faith in Sean, and doesn't worry too much if the man goes 3 months away for work. But also Dan has to have some faults, a too perfect hero would be too much boring, so he is instead a knight in shining, and a bit cracked, armor, that is even better.Again the book is not what I was expecting (no big Hollywood scenes) but nevertheless a book that got me hooked till the end. And this time for me it's complete, not loose ends, the love story is full, developed and nicely tightened up."
2013-02-9,B007IJLGUY,5.0,Great little book with lots of helpful tips.,A3L99QA1E6JWQ4,The book has a lot of information and ideas in it. It was specific enough for me. It was well written and brings out good ideas to market your business or product online. It gives good information and ideas on how to show up better on search engines too. I think the amount of useful information along the price of this ebook makes this a great deal.  It has given me a lot of ideas on how to get more use out of Facebook for promoting my little business and has encouraged me to create a blog.I would definitely recommend this book to a friend. I found very practical and useful information that I was able to use. This one is a keeper and a nice addition to my Kindle library.
2012-09-1,B007JVCU3S,5.0,I can't wait for the next one!,A309V8TFSLVTPP,"I enjoyed this story and was always wanting to know what happened next.  I got held up in the middle of the book because of other things in my life making me not have time to read for awhile.  It was in no way a reflection on the book and it's pull to finish it.I loved the way the way new information kept cropping up little by little.  I enjoyed this way of story telling better than everything happening at once and the characters fighting their way out of it.  I think it built the suspense and think it is what compelled to keep reading and wanting to know more.There were some sad parts, but I think these are things that make a great story.  There were some characters and things they did that made me want to scream, but again it is things like this that make a great story.That being said, I did notice a few editing errors, or parts in which the grammar wasn't exactly the same as how I would have learned it in the US.  However, I know that the author lives in Canada, so this may be the reason for some of the slight differences.  These weren't enough to detract from the story, I just changed it in my head as I read it, so that it made sense to me.I don't really want to sit here and pick apart every thing I liked and disliked individually because I don't want to leave any spoilers in this review.  I just urge others to read it because you won't regret it!!!I also can't wait for the next one.  Remember how I said the author introduces new story pieces little by little.  He left one new piece that keeps me craving to know more right at the very end of this one!"

2012-05-22,B007K1EGAM,5.0,Couldn't Put it Down,A36VWER1YMGHMT,"If you like your medieval romances spiced with a little sword and sorcery, you'll love Vijaya Schartz's ""Princess of Bretagne."" Set in the dark ages as Christianity spreads across Europe in conflict with the old ways and Vikings raid the coasts, the book is in ways reminiscent of Marion Zimmer Bradley's ""The Mists of Avalon"" with its Lost Isle and women of mystery and power. Well written and factual, the book weaves history with fantasy and magic into a story that I could not put down. Schartz's characters are well drawn and complex, a splendid cast of heroes and villains. And it ends on a note of uncertainty that had me eagerly awaiting its continuation in the next in the series."
2013-01-27,B007KM9SS6,3.0,Not for readers under 18,A3DE5WP5XV9Q4F,I have to say that I did not like this bundle as well as her others. The premise of being basically sold into slavery by some unscrupulous person in your life just doesn't sit well with me. But I did like that all of the stories ended on a happy note.
2014-01-28,B007KTEF9Q,3.0,Kiwi HEA,A1ACIK34MC3R7W,The author manages to step above what could have been a very run of the mill billionaire formula romance by letting the H/h have some truely relatable conflicts.  Having an alcoholic parent is no joke.  Dallas would do almost anything not repeat those negative behaviors.  Cassandra's pain due to her losses is palpable and explains most of her behavior.  Pain that deep is not generally negated by feelings of lust at first sight.  Had the author refrained from this hackneyed ploy I would have gladly given a higher rating.  Writing style very good.  Straight romance not usually my genre can't really recommend.  But if it is yours you'll love it.
2012-05-6,B007LEI9YW,5.0,Yum!,AX615ENPZRMEH,I am enjoying trying out new pies and my family is loving it.  Great deal for me.  I love my kindle and the books I can get for everything under the sun.  Love the cookbook!
2014-07-2,B007LPVXIA,3.0,"The Possibilities of Amy was a fun, quick story that puts us inside the head ...",A39070TA5C1GJD,"The Possibilities of Amy was a fun, quick story that puts us inside the head of David, a typical teenage boy, as he obsesses over his newest crush, Amy, the new girl in town.I thought the author did an excellent job getting inside David's head.  She was able to portray his worries and fears over trying to work himself up to talk to his crush.  I felt David's character was very realistic, and even though it was quite short, we were able to see him mature from the beginning to the end of the story.I would have loved to have a bit more of an ending.  I felt that the story kind of dropped off and we were left with a lot of questions.  But, I love all the possibilities of Amy.I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."
2012-04-21,B007LS0JQE,5.0,Wonderful beginning!,A1UYQW8VCD4VUV,"Help Wanted is the short story that launches this author's Fantasy Heights series, and as such I thought it was very well done.  Amanda is a jilted bride, newly unemployed and looking to escape the sudden mess and humiliation that her life has become.  When she happens upon a postcard advertising for help at a fantasy sex club, she jumps at the chance to 'become someone else' for a while.  And what unfolds in this sizzling hot short is her trial period with the people (both guests and co-workers) at Fantasy Heights.This was extremely well written, with only a very few typos (I think I saw two, but then got so sucked up into the story that either there weren't any more or I just didn't see them).  I liked the characters, particularly Thomas (what is it about strong, sexually confident and maybe even just a little bit dominant men?).  I will definitely be looking for the rest in the series.  I would recommend this book to anyone who's ever done a little roleplaying in the bedroom or who's looking for a sensual, sizzling hot read.  This book's got you covered!"
2012-03-21,B007M5U0KQ,5.0,What a Wonderful Book!,A3B8M1H2TOWU7C,"I purchased this book for my granddaughter, who has just started taking ballet lessons, and we read it together.It took me back to when I when I took ballet lessons as a little girl and I was able to share my experiences with my granddaughter as we went through the book.It's a delightful story and very well written.I now plan to check out the other books by this author."
2012-03-23,B007MHK248,5.0,Not just for YAs,A2N1N7JLMA3Q70,"Although this book is primarily aimed at the ""young adult"" and teen audience, i enjoyed this first installment tremendously. The plot is well thought out and moves at a great pace, that keeps the reader interested. The characters develop throughout the book and the reader soon gets pulled into the emotional affairs. This is a promising new talented author and i hope to have a chance to read the sequel to this. My daughter read the book after me and she cannot wait for the next part of this moving and intriguing story."
2014-04-5,B007ND93EQ,3.0,MUST HAVES FOR THE SUCCESSFUL ENTREPRENEUR,A17UY69IGPSTTK,"Alicia Morga talks about the 20 most important lessons she learned on her way up the entrepreneurial ladder in a short but informative book.  Her advice is you have to TALK THE WALK AND WALK THE TALK.  After all, your business is you, isn&#8217;t it?  In other words, if your business is based on certain guiding principles and you don&#8217;t PRACTICE WHAT YOU PREACH, can you honestly expect success?  I don&#8217;t think so.  It could have been a little longer."
2012-08-7,B007NJD1AM,4.0,They live among us,AH70A62F0Z6K7,"In The Mall Fairies: Exile, Conda Douglas has sketched out a world where the fairies live among humans, seen through the eyes of a teen fairy named Swoop. Like many teens, she is trying to find her place in her society, while skirting the rules.  Her story is paralleled by that of a human girl Grace, who has a scheme to run away to go to art school to escape the family drama of her grandmother's drinking and her own guilt about her grandfather's death.  While the fairies must keep their existence secret from humans, Grace's grandmother knows about them, but of course, no one believes her. When the time comes that Swoop needs her help to save a friend's life, Grace needs to capture a fairy to prove that her grandmother is not crazy.I was impressed by the realism of the fairy society, which treats fairies as small people who can fly with the use of a special ointment, which is now running out, and that no one knows how to make. Clearly, fairies have not always lived in the mall, and the book hints at their previous history, raising questions to be explored in series.The human situation is well described too, though in broader strokes, as we already know what it's like to be human.  Like many first-in-the-series novels, this one lets us fly through the fairy world, following as Swoop takes ever-increasing risks. Both girls make unfortunate choices, and the repercussions  make their original goals seem childish. It is an excellent coming of age story unfolding across the edges of two worlds.I received a free copy of this book for review."
2012-12-8,B007NUVFN6,4.0,"Feasted On: Ritter Werewolves Series, Book 1",AJVQTGMBF8PL1,"4 out of 5 stars! This is a story about an unusual meeting and beginning of a romance between two soul mates. I thoroughly enjoyed getting to know Max and Janet. They were a fun, speed-loving couple.The only things I'm curious about are what happened to them once the story ended (meaning I wish there was an epilogue) and how did Max get all of his money? Was his family rich? It's a question that's been plaguing me ever since I finished the novella.I recommend this novella to anyone who likes paranormal and werewolf romances!Review By: From Me to You ...

2013-02-20,B007P0OLSA,5.0,Hot Steampunk Zombies!,A3C6VBQ17B8EYG,"This journey into the Steamwork Chronicles, book two is a passage into a lust ridden zombie plague that morphs into something a lot more dire. First you go crazy sexually and then the blood lust comes. When the book opened up, I was sucked right into the vortex of feeling. Author Cari Silverwood can turn a phrase and if you don't have a whole lot of lust in your heart after reading this book then you must be one of the undead yourself. lol.When the main character is paired with a frankenstruct male, she fights the inner urges that make her lust for him so completely. Sensuous, delightful and in turns frightening, this world is not for the faint of heart.The dialogue is effortless, the BDSM elements will rock your world and the fear that comes with a zombie plague adds a new level of ferocity that drives this plot forward at a fevered pace. I loved this book!5/5"
2012-08-10,B007PKOQC6,5.0,"Awesome in ""Black""",AH2N51PLM06H5,"The old priest arose to do his duty to the Great Mother. He would not neglect her. The villagers demanded a sacrifice. No matter how much he tried to teach them of The Great Mother's love, they would not give up their barbaric practices. When he reached the temple, he thought vandals had desecrated it, only to find it was worse than that - a sacrifice, it was his granddaughter. The Mother anointed him with his granddaughters ashes and told him it was time and proceeded to destroy the temple.When he awoke, it was to find the villagers gone, only blood left behind. It was a new day, a prophet was born he thought as he walked away from the village.Tommy's girlfriend had dumped him and hooked up with Eric, a ghoul with ragged hair, greasy skin and clothes that looked like they were from Goodwill. Tommy and Eric had a couple of run-ins, but Tommy told him he really didn't want Alyson back so he didn't need to be jealous. Eric wouldn't let it go.Tommy and his friends went to the movies and when they came out, Eric and some skin head friends of his were waiting for them. As Bruce and Tommy managed to overpower the skinheads, Eric just stood and watched. When he heard the police sirens coming, he took off.Tommy had taken the brunt of the fight. He had grabbed the knife being held on Coda with his bare hand. As the doctor was stitching it up, Coda had come in asked why he would do something like that for someone he didn't even know. His response had been, there wasn't anything else he could do. Tommy told Coda about his grandfather, a Taoist monk, who taught him martial arts and how he taught Bruce and some others and she was more than welcome to join them.Alyson came to Tommy after Eric had given her a box to keep for him. She had opened it and what she had seen inside frightened her. She told them about Eric's dark side and how he was into magic. She thought the book was a grimoire and it gave her the creeps. Tommy thought they should go see an old friend of theirs, Mike Ferguson, who might be able to help them figure out what the book was all about. They warned him not to let Eric find out he had it.When Tommy and Alyson went back to Mike to see what he found out, Mike had a crazy look on his face. Mike was asking Alyson if Eric had any odd cuts or wounds, when they heard pounding at the doors. They exploded inward. The group was around the table which was surrounded by a blue line, a ward of protection. Eric appeared looking like a monster, with shapes carved all over his face,  even his teeth. He broke through the barrier and grabbed Mike demanding the book. When Eric grabbed Tommy, it was all he could do to remain conscious until something hit Eric and dropped him to the floor. Bruce stood there with a piece of railing in his hand. Alyson threw the book to Eric. As Eric said to tell them he was coming, he slit his own throat.Mike, along with his goth girls were at Eric's grave. When Tommy saw Mike, he told him to  enjoy what time he had left. What did he mean by that? The book Eric had was the worst, it dealt with calling the Nephilim. The prophecies had said Eric would return as the Prince of Nephilim. One of the rituals involved eating a fetus cut from the womb.As Mike began telling them about his delve into magic, he had to show them examples and do a lot of explaining. Will Eric return as the Prince of Nephilim? What will he do it he does return? Would he destroy them or the whole world?As the Peris, Mike's goth girls, told the history of the First of the Host and the Great Creation, it made me think of the Charmed Ones, a TV program currently in re-runs. They mention the grimoire, the hollow, demons, vampires, ghouls...........The characters:Bruce and Tommy were good fighters, but they only used violence when necessary. Bruce was more of a goof off and Tommy was more serious, mystical even. Tommy was such a good guy. He knew he could take violence to a new level, but he tried really hard to control it. Bruce could go from a foul-mouthed, trash talking screw up to a sweet big-hearted teddy bear with Kung-fu. He did a great job of hiding his most intimate feelings.Coda was a beautiful, loving, ""good girl"". It was hard for her to go after what was right for her because she was always trying to do the right thing by others.Eric was a rotten person even before he turned himself evil. He thought all humanity was shit.Alyson didn't care about anyone but herself. She had given Tommy his first kiss, she was Tommy's first sexual experience, his first love and she betrayed him.Dan was a spineless, rich boy who didn't have many deep feelings. He had that rich way of assuming certain things would happen.Dude - I am speechless - WOW - awesome. Amazing doesn't even cover it. Knocked my f___ing socks off. I'm pissed at having to wait for the next one. I gotta have it and I want it now. I wrote those words as soon as I passed the last period of the book. I was very surprised that I liked it so much. I like reading this type of book, but I'm not usually so engrossed and excited by the story. After I was about halfway through I began to eat it up, as if I had been starving and the food was the words. Ate the words like M & M's, my favorite candy. Even when the book was at it's darkest, it could raise a chuckle out of me. The writing was great and it was hard for me to put it down. It surpassed a five-star review. I thought the cover was very interesting and the color combination caught my eye. The cover and title are things that influence me and I like when they pertain to the story. The story was definitely black and dark. The blood and gore I like usually comes in the form of a murder mystery, but the carnage in this book had me unable to put it down until I found a spot in the story where the action slowed down a little bit and I could take a breath. This is a must read on your list.Black -- Canto I of The Nephilim Codex"
2013-06-7,B007PPJOGO,5.0,Awesome!!!!!,A2RW7L94BMOXL8,This book was SOOOOO GOOOD  I can't wat to finish the series! If your looking for great Sex scenes this is not the book for you but if your looking for a Love Story than you need to read this book. I read this thru the week so only got to read it in the evening after work but I could not wait till the work day was over to get back to the book. I actually skipped a day of work to read it lol. So I would recommend this to any True Romantic.Plus the first one is FREE great deal.
2012-11-18,B007PPJOGO,5.0,Can't wait to read the next in the series,A251G9O3M734KL,This is a wonderful story. I really enjoyed reading the story of these two falling in love. I look forward to reading more by this author.

Once you start In The Arms Of A Stranger you will not want to put it down! You will fall in love with the characters instantly.

2013-04-12,B007R6S3RM,4.0,Good Dystopian Series,A259Y5DEWPPBN2,"This is a short dystopian novella that is fast paced and ends in a cliff hanger, as described. The book is hard to describe without really spoiling anything. The basic story is Nadia being separated from her sister and attempting to get out of her current situation so they can be reunited. It is set in the future of a privileged society and everyone else is scrapping to get their tiny piece of it. It doesn't give a lot of back story so you don't really know how she came to be in this situation or too much detail about the place that she currently is. It was fast paced and a quick read that keeps you coming back for more. I really enjoyed it. I was looking for a quick read and have been in a reading slump so this was a nice a spark to get me back reading. I have already read the second in the series and the story builds as you continue on. I bought the rest of the books in the series so I hope they continue to peak my interest"
2013-01-19,B007RGCX5A,5.0,Another gripping 'Auto' instalment,A3BUFKH4MARWCD,"This is the second book I have read in David Wailing's 'Auto' series (which can be read in any order) and it is a short but highly enjoyable read.The author has created an all too believable future for his series and, on one level, it is a purely entertaining piece of fiction, but on another, it is a stark warning for what happens when technology spirals out of control.We are with the lead character all the way and feel her fear as her Auto, a digital assistant, pairs her up with a complete stranger and creates an uncontrollable relationship. It is page-turning stuff and it speaks volumes that, as a reader who does not normally seek out this genre, I am eagerly looking to read another book in the series."
2012-04-24,B007RZ2N7Y,1.0,Ludicrous,A216M0I9NTSAJU,"This is beyond puerile. It has no plot, it just rambles about an impossible character, supposedly a world renowned surgeon who kills or sexually assaults people for fun or in revenge for personal slights. He breaks into people's homes while they are absent and assumes their identity, again, just to amuse himself. Even the sex misses, it is not erotic, just a mention that something sexual happened. There is no character development, the characters are all flat cardboard figures, the dialogue is improbable, the scenes implausible. It includes conjoined ""Siamese"" twins who are hitmen and spend their time arguing about their sex life, one is gay, the other hetero. They apparently are so inept that they need to discuss beforehand how they will go about doing something like turning around. If it was comedy this might work, but it isn't comedy, there is nothing funny about it. This book is rubbish, not worth reading. It would not pass muster as a comic book, it certainly fails as a novel. There is something extremely suspicious about the number of high rated reviews - I don't believe that they are genuine."
2013-09-22,B007S7LKFM,5.0,Always a winner,A3K88OGL8T2GBK,"Gosh Terri Reid, you never disappoint me. These Mary O'Reilly books are the best. I just wish that they would go on and on. I'm sorry to say it's not going to be the same without Mike no longer in the book, but I""'ll be looking forward to meeting Bradley's daughter. You are and always a winner."

The main man is hotter than his job, and can place his boots in my bed anytime. Phew.I quite often find myself falling for the leading man in a book, after all, that's one of the things that we love about this genre isn't it? That and a touch of magic here and there?The story was well cunningly rought, and I love some of the twists and turns it took. It was even a little dark in places.All in all quite a good read. Enjoyed it, and it definitely put a smile on my dial!"

2012-09-29,B007TPI9Q6,5.0,Very Enjoyable,AE8PO29YNG438,I enjoyed this short story as well. It was very tautly written and contained interesting Native American beliefs and practices. It kept my interest to the end.

It was interesting and a great way to spend an afternoon.I think it is enough to say that I enjoyed a book without having to write so many words to get my Kindle to submit.  It is hard for me to see the keyboard and I hit too many letters and it takes a while to delete and start over - my eyesight is not as good as when I was younger.  However, I do enjoy most of the books that I have downloaded and I usually really really enjoy them!  Thank you for making them available to readers."
2012-10-30,B007WIXSK2,5.0,"Interesting times, interesting stories",A2RXNTFJ4318I8,"The stories of the four women in Whorticulture can be read as stand-alone stories but are linked together by the times in which they live and the men in their lives. Handled badly, this could be jarring but the lyricism of the writing in Whorticulture ensures this isn't the case.Each story focuses on a relationship, not a love story but more of a power struggle between each woman and the man in her life. In those times, of course the man often held the upper hand but these are strong women who fight in their own ways to preserve the things they value within the limitations of their society.While each story is beautifully written and told in a voice that feels authentic for the period, I enjoyed Seraphine's Bouquet the most. The narration in this section weaves a lot of colloquial humor through her story. While the subject matter is often grim, the book is superbly crafted and a joy to read."

This is one of the most entertaining and unique books I've read in a very long time.  I'm a huge fan of Greek Mythology, and a Huge fan of Fantasy... this combines those subjects beautifully throw in some Sci-Fi, and you are continually turning page after page wondering what is going to happen next!The characters in this book are amazing, Orlin the cat is a brilliant touch that adds so much to the story.  Add in the amazing world he has created that is as well done as any book I've ever read.  This is one talented author folks... imaginative and brilliant are words that simply do not do him justice. This plot is so well developed, and there is so much angst going on, you have to remind yourself to stop holding your breath!You will absolutely not be disappointed with this book.  I can't recommend highly enough."

2012-08-9,B007XJGATQ,5.0,Chronic Pain,A2HAE620LLSB7I,"This book is a collection of poems Perez wrote as she was ""introduced to pain, was married to pain, divorced pain, and remarried a few years later."" Perez reminds us, ""It is not easy to live with pain, but it is possible.""Perez shares her inmost heart.  Her pain-filled cries go out to a God she knows is there even when He seems not to be.  Even when she finds herself drawn back in to relationships and feelings that move her away from a place of safety, she remembers the God who has sealed her to himself.These poems take the reader through betrayal, sorrow and a marvelous comfort as she is pulled from and through what most troubles the soul. In her words are not only brutality and evil, but love and forgiveness.Perez is a former marine and a disabled veteran. She lives in, through and beyond her chronic pain, in ways that will take you to your knees."

It had suspense, humor, a little romance, & I actually learned some new trivia about not only diamonds, but other colored gems!  Kim, the main character, would probably chastise me for this statement, but I love colored gems & colored diamonds even more!  However, she would be pleased to know that I have not use my school book money or rent money to purchase them.  If you read the book you'll understand.  I can't wait for the second installment to see what new things happen in the life of Kim & her grandfather, Max.Pick this book up, it is a great summer read."

Fierce guards and huge wolves are assigned the sole duty to protect her as they travel.  They meet renegades who demand a toll.  The guards are planning to pay the renegades, but Daeton jumps off her horse & runs up to the renegades, ignoring her guards, yelling that they won't pay them & they'd better let them pass ""or else"".  She instructs the guards & wolves to rally around her & the renegades run off.  So, Daeton ignored the guards, (who were trained to know how to handle dangerous situations) and does whatever she feels like doing, which puts everyone's life in danger.  Instead of the guards and everyone being angry, they all compliment her on how brave she is.  Surely, there is no braver female in the realm.The story was riddled with similar immature actions that we were supposed to admire.  I had trouble reconciling the author's audience.  I understand that the heroine was 18, so maybe it is targeted at a teenage audience, but the writing style seemed more geared toward 13 & 16 year olds.The sex scenes were more of the same writing style.  They lacked depth and interest.To be fair, it was only 99 cents. Just don't expect more than your money's worth.  In fact, at the time of this review the first book of this series ""A Curve of Claw"" was free.  Try reading it, or something free by this author, to see whether you like her style."

One for recipes, and another to talk more generally about what a new food is, where it comes from, and how to make recipes of my own. But Green Smoothies talks in depth AND gives great recipes! It's a permanent part of my kitchen library, and a central tool for small gatherings and impromptu meetings."

2013-02-28,B0082CIMCQ,2.0,Great story but lame title for the book,A2F0T0R3C82ZB1,"This was  good story and it could have evolved even more.  I'd say the title is QUITE disappointing.  I've never seen it, but I'm assuming there's actually a murder ON the orient express. That said, it's not the case with this book.I could sympathize with the main character, the story is about a woman who is practically the sole care giver for her mother, though her father helps out as well. . . that part could have been developed more, what she did, why she gave up her career for it, etc.The resolution was just too wrapped up too quickly and with too neat of a bow for me.Nice story, but disappointed overall in the crime, the details, and the resolution."
2013-06-1,B0082VAR20,3.0,"Diary of a Nursing Sister on the Western Front, 1914-1915",A2SZAEY94NY1UX,"Told from the very interesting perspective of a Nursing Sister very close to the front lines during The Great War. We first meet her as she is taking a ship to Havre along with troops and other medical personel. She tells of a rather festive atmosphere on board. When she reaches Havre she is keen to start her duties.The unknown Nurse is posted to a Hospital Train which travels to the front lines to triage the wounded and to give medical aid. She is later assigned to a Field Hospital before the Diary ends very abruptly.The writing is simplistic and straightforward, the nurse includes commentary about the weather, billets, food and the people.It almost reads as a travelogue.When she is posted to the Hospital Train and tells in a no nonsense manner of the conditions aboard Train, the writing is almost visceral.  The Nurse speaks of the mud, rain filled trenches, the constant bombardment, the casualties, the comradeship, the sacrifices, the sheer numbers of the men who fought.Other reviewers have spoken of the lack of medical procedures/diseases etc revealed, but for a diary I felt it was almost impersonal, a clinical account of events which must have been simply horrific and overwhelming.She writes of being on the train on night duty and having to care for at least 120 very sick men. No nurse to patient ratios in those days or conditions.It is the day to day struggle to care for her patients, even the enemy of occasions that I found to be quite compelling reading. It is the absolute stoicism that hits you with this very personal insight into life on the Western Front and the indefatigable spirit of the Nursing Sister."
2013-06-25,B0083WTVT8,4.0,Now hooked on Manhattan Ten,A8DBC1RO8128K,"Rating 4 Stars - Loved ItI am a huge fan of Superhero movies like X-Men, The Avengers, Fantastic Four and was excited to find a Paranormal series with yummy Superheroes.Temptress is a fun, quick read with a smidge of romance. While Temptress is trying to give ThinkTank his powers back by kissing him every time and having to spend time together until his powers are back they are slowly falling for each other. The action, nice build up to their romance worked well for me. There was not an actual love scene but a different kind of sexy fore play scene that got me hot and bothered. Loved that they were both Superheroes but deep down just ordinary people dealing with everyday life and loved that they got to see not only their superhero side but their inner side as well.The best part of the novel is that The Manhattan Ten is known in the world with no secret identity. Only got a little bit of here and there on the rest of the Manhattan Ten crew but it was enough to get me interested in them more. Love that they all have their own voice and different personalities. Now hooked on Manhattan Ten, had to buy Panther's story in Ivory (Manhattan Ten #2) to see how he got to his Bachelor Party. The first two novels are out of order (reason on authors blog) but that did not take away from Temptress and Tanks story.Originally posted at Wickedly Delicious Book Blog"
2012-07-4,B0083XG72Q,4.0,New start,A9IK5K9R5VCAN,"This review is also posted on Risque ReviewsDonna McDonald's Next Time I Sing is a wonderful story about three women who feel the need to start something new after they have been burned in love. This is a touching story, with Chloe feeling insecure because she's not California thin, blonde or tanned. As Chloe starts flirting with Jasper, with her friends' approval, she realizes life still has a lot to offer. Love is among those things. As her confidence grows, so does her boldness. Not to mention, it is refreshing to read about mature women who still are ready to give love a go. The truth is that it is also very reassuring to read about them acting the way they probably did in college but with just a touch more confidence and poise than they had back then. The friendship between the three women--Chloe, Emma, and Taylor--is true also. The friends want to help each other to regain their footing in life again. So, this is Chloe's story.Chloe has to deal with finding a new job, even if Jasper manages to persuade her to start by being the hotel's singer. Her beautiful voice and full body bring in happy patrons every night she is performing, and soon, she and Jasper take their new relationship to the next level. They have to fight against two exes. Jasper's former wife wants to keep him for booty calls. Chloe's ex-husband shows up unexpectedly to re-kindle their marriage. When love comes knocking,Chloe is brave enough to go for it, and the ensuing hot sex and romantic moments are so sweet that I really look forward to the next book.'The only thing I didn't really like in the story is that Chloe's friends call her a closet slut because she liked dating different men while she was in college. I have never liked the fact that girls or women are depicted as sluts just because they like sex, and I hope this will not be a part of the Next Time Around series. I think romance readers will really enjoy this quick light read well worth the pages it's printed upon!'"

2013-06-12,B0084B132Q,5.0,Black Beauty- Autobiography of a Horse,A1ZE77YJP8BKEJ,"Black Beauty-Autobiography of a Horse by Anna Sewell. A great book that I highly recommend for all ages. This is for the horse lovers,those who no little of horses,and for children. The wording can be difficult to understand at times. This is because this book was written in the 1800`s and the setting is in England with the English wording. But mostly fairly easy to understand. I cried, I laughed, i rooted for the horses,and applauded when things went well in the horses` favor. This book is great for teaching children to respect and care for animals. To consider their feelings. To put themselves in their place. Even though, I had taught my son from a young age to respect and care for animals, I downloaded this book to his Kindle to get a horses view from""the horses mouth"" and to have a better understanding of them and all our other animal companions on our planet."
2012-09-18,B0084F4N3I,5.0,Retribution... Will Love Conquer All!,AIIK1Z94HK7A6,In this EPIC conclusion to The Redemption Series I had the honor and privilege to read an ARC copy of Retribution and HOLY BABY JESUS did I not want this series to end. I loved it so much and this is one of those series that re-read multiple times.In Retribution it picks up right where Ransom left off. Dayton and Marcas are still bound but there is something new to them. They have discovered love. They are in love and want to be with each other and it goes against everything known to man for a demon and angel to be together. Dayton has proven that she loves Marcas and will do whatever it takes to be with him. She has defeated his mother who was The Demon Queen and Satan is upset and pays Dayton a little visit.Marcas will do whatever it takes to be with Dayton so when his father and brother start to work against him he has to fight harder. When his brother Damon kidnaps Dayton he will fight like hell to get her back in his arms. Dayton and Marcas know that there is a war brewing and if they can't get it together soon it will come to fruition and all of mankind will be lost.In this epic battle where good VS evil is in a show down you do not want to miss what happens. Can love conquer all? Can love survive Satan? Can love crack the evil that lurks in the dark? R.K. I need another series like this because I am so going to miss Dayton and Marcas and Damon and all the drama that comes with them. Thank you for a great series!
2012-06-5,B0085H8AWU,5.0,Great short story,A3RTJQ09K59422,"I have been wanting to read this novel since I read ""Fairy Tale Flirts!""; I love Lisa Scott's Flirts! novels.  In ""My Fake Fiance"", Samantha Cooper is invited to her frenemy, Carrie Lamont's wedding.  Feeling desperate about her nonexistent love life, she and her roommate, Micki, devise a plan to create a fake fierce and find the perfect guy to play the part.  Justin Banks, the heartthrob who agrees to play the part, uses the situation to his advantage by telling his ill mother he has a girlfriend.  This story was absolutely adorable!  I love that it it told from Sam and Justin's point of view.  I also loved how sweet and caring Justin's character was; their fake relationship was literally the icing on the cake...it developed fast, and it was like they instantly clicked.  I can't wait to read the rest of the stories in the Wedding Flirts! collection."
2012-06-5,B0085O2OSO,4.0,Insightful Minds Review,A12GBZM9SDCITA,"Original Review Posted at - (...)This book was first brought to my attention on Twitter! Then I got an email about the Blog Tour for this and here we are! :) I must say, I was in no way disappointed with this book. I completely fell in love with the characters and the direction the story took!Sofia has had one hard life so far. She witnessed the death of her father, along with getting a glimpse of the ""thing"" that killed him. She basically became an adult at the age of 10, due to her mother basically living in the bottom of an alcohol bottle. Her school life wasn't much better than her home life. She was teased for any and everything. Then again, it had been this way for as long as she can remember.Then Jason shows up in town and wouldn't you know it, he's in her class. After years of being ignored and made fun of, she couldn't understand why Jason was so adamant about being her friend. After some insane convincing on his part, she finally caved and embraced the friendship. The more time she spent with Jason, the more she thought she could feel herself falling for him. Along with friendship; this was an entirely new feeling for her.Insert Jason's bad boy brother, Robbie into the picture. What is Sophia to do when Robbie shows up? Not understanding the hostility between the brothers, she sets out to figure out just what is going on. Nothing prepared her for the shock of the truth she discovered. With Jason attempting to convince her that not only is Robbie is an evil ""non human"", but he is also the ""thing"" that killed her father. Yet something seems... off about all of this. With a new found mission, Sophia sets off to figure out the truth. What she finds out not only confuses her, but makes her realize that her heart just might lie with the other brother.Then Jason goes and chances the game completely. Same players, new script. Two brothers, one girl and many secrets. Insert Awesomeness Here!I freaking loved this book. I wish there was another word for love. I'm sure there is, but I am also sure it's not the best word to describe just what kind of love I am talking about! Sophia is one epically written heroine. She is alpha all the way. You know, the kick ass, take names later kinda :) Which is freaking amazing, because I cannot stand weak & wimpy heroines. The ending got me though! I cannot wait to read more about this!"
2013-02-12,B0085P68SU,4.0,Oceans Between Us,A233MEDLCPDSX6,Pretty sweet book. Wasn't  sure what to think of it at first. The middle was kind of slow but a very sweet ending.

2012-06-8,B0087ZEX3A,5.0,Delish!,A35T6S15S5AWMC,"What can I say? I just bought this cook book and I am already in love with it! The book contains twenty-six great seafood dishes, nine side dishes, and tells you what what combination they are best served in. Even if you are new to cooking fish, don't worry. This book clearly explains the best ways to chose which fish to buy and the proper way to grill or barbecue it.The first thing I made was fish fillets with a pepper dew dip that was an immediate hit with my family, the dip is fantastic and would go well with just about anything, and I know my family will be want more every time they come over from now on. Just from reading the book it is apparent that these are real home recipes that the author has been preparing for a long time. Two thumbs up!"
2012-06-30,B0088342Q4,4.0,Vampire Underground in No Need of Rescue,A3EM21KS93W4ZK,"Vampire Underground in No Need of a RescueVampire Underground: Rescue, by Anthea Kage, can only be described as a speeding erotic paranormal mystery.  It is by no means a romance novel, and the hero of the piece, and main character, Tess; would probably cringe at her tale being thought of as such.  From the opening of the book, one is caught up in her world of secrecy, espionage, and freedom fighting to the point of reading until the book is finished.The characters, what there are of them, are well developed, but vague enough to leave room for the reader's mind to explore some interesting possibilities.  Like all stories, there are good and not so good characters, but it is vividly clear which is which.  Tess, Kage's main drive behind the force of the novel, is a strong presence with iron composure, a heart of gold, and a healthy hunger for the opposite sex once she allows her inner emotional animal out of its cage.  The author's descriptive capability is fine-tuned.  Whether focusing on characters, landscape, or plot, one has a clear view of his or her surrounding and the people involved in the action.The plot is original, creative, and simply a fun read, but at times falls victim to an over abundance of sexual content when a little would have gone a very long way.  The language during such times echoes the base-level animalistic sexual exploits of the main character and her bedroom interests.  The plain truth is that if one chooses the work simply to bath in sexual exploits, he or she will be disappointed, because there is an actual storyline, and it is a good one.  However, as for myself, I would have preferred a bit more detail in the story line, and a bit less detail in the erotic scenes.  I always have been one to favor a guitar's softer undertones, rather than blatant drum solo.  Happily, in the harmony of this tale, there was enough of a guitar's emotion in the underpinning to soften the pounding of the drums a bit."

I was so impacted by the excerpt that I came to amazon and looked up the rest of his books. I can say that he has a new fan. First of all, I loved his characters and the descriptions make you feel as though you are in the room with them.  Secondly the things that these characters does so well is make you think of people that you know just like them. Thirdly, his ends have a kick you in the face twist. In other words it leaves you saying, I was not looking for that to happen"". Sonya and her husband Eric are a little bit special.Sonya is having difficulty getting pregnant and Eric is head over heels for them to have children. His head-over heelness causes some serious issues in the marriage, but we don't realize the full magnitude of the problem until it all goes south. It goes south QUICKLY and very badly. The ending was  priceless. I was not expecting that at all.The secondary characters are amazing Milton, Linda and crazy Mamma Nelly need their own story.When Nelly and Eric had it out in the drive way I thought I would die laughing. I loved it, great story, great book!!!!!!!!!!!!"

It explains what you can expect and why it is so rewarding for the right people.Dana explains very clearly why the nursing occupation will continue to have exceptional growth for many years to come and why it is important to make yourself standout both in person and on paper.I particularly liked the description of who the best nurses are and why they are the best.Do you have what it takes? This book answers that question... clearly!Note - My daughter is currently in nursing school in Baltimore and I can't wait for her to read this."

When forced to accompany a noble woman to her Uncle's home, the party is attacked by the Corscan soldiers. The Corscans do not let any enemy live during an attack and the only way to avoid death for a female is to be chosen as a prisoner bride by one of the soldiers.  When Elara is chosen by a Corscan soldier the story really begins.  I really, really liked the book up until Elara becomes separated in the Capital City of Corscan and my complaint after that point is the story seemed to be compressed and hurried.  While the rest of the story contained good character development and interactions, the very last rushed through a long time period and rushed through the climatic encounter between the two characters (I also was not convinced Elara would run away since she had been so stubborn and brave throughout the rest of the book, but it is a minor point).  I have not read anything like this story.  I enjoyed it and recommend it."
2013-08-22,B008DDW4OQ,4.0,I'd be counting MY Lucky Stars!!!,A2EWV79XJ1B45H,"Well, Kristen has done it yet again.  A fairy tale type of book that isn't too mushy to enjoy!  As always, in my reviews, I won't give too much detail from the book because I STRONGLY feel it will either give something away or a BOOK ""LONG"" REVIEW is just such a waste of EVERYONE'S time!  (I mean really!  :)  Just my opinion.)With that said, I really like how Kristen can weave characters to the point of being able to either relate to them in some way or actually picture them as real people.  Now the only thing I didn't like about this book, as I am finding out with Kristen's earlier books, she has a little bit too much detail on things that are not all that important.  Other than that, this was another winner in my....well...book.  (HA HA HA) sorry.As you know, if you read the Blurb about the book, you have a female character who is dating a guy and ends up with his brother.  Now as bad as that sounds, it really isn't.  The guy she ""starts"" with is NOT who you think and the one she ends up with?  Well, let's just say WOW.  There are quite a few things that are going on during their time together and other characters in the story help the plot along.  You will be surprised by some of the things, or antics, a couple of other characters do and act like and you will laugh you butt off on the actions and behavior of the others.  This story is filled with love, suspense, doubt, humor, ghosts and so much more.I highly recommend this read.  Plus, a bonus, this is a stand alone book so there is no Cliff Hanger, no waiting months, years for another one and so on.  So, pick this one up/down load it whatever you need to do and get ready to really enjoy yourself with one heck of a great read!"

Karen Mead has created a world that was interesting to immerse myself in for a bit, eve though I am ages above what I assume is the target demographic, heh. I felt like there were a few parallels to Kim Harrison's The Hollows series, but not so many that this screamed rip-off to me. If anything it made me more interested in what will happen in the next book and I have already purchased it. I plan to keep this author and this series in mind for the future."
2013-07-25,B008EGEOW2,5.0,The Island,AQVGSI84SR40K,Exceptionally well developed although I don't really care for the series aspect of it.  I enjoyed the writing and the story line.
2014-01-25,B008F9K47M,4.0,Love Means... Renewal by Andrew Grey,A1E481YU3ZPK6S,"Sometime is nice to have an insight on what is happening after the happily ever after; not that you want for the couple to break up or similar, but that little window in their future is usually nice and warming. For Eli and Geoff is exactly like that.I admit I haven&#8217;t read all the series, so I didn&#8217;t know Eli and Geoff adopted a little kid, Jackie. It was a nice surprise to see them as daddies, and Jackie seems really a cute kid, very loving and loved as well. Even if Eli, currently, is very busy, and also tired, he always finds time to give love and comfort to Jackie, even when this means losing a little of intimacy with Geoff. But Geoff is not resenting it, he loves Jackie as much as Eli.This is only a novella, there isn&#8217;t nothing new happening in their lives, but it&#8217;s a way to have a confirmation that their love is strong, and not limited to the two of them, but able to include in their circle of love the extended family they created, including family, friends and co-workers."

2013-06-4,B008GUV1H2,2.0,Not worth the money,A3NF30GVZXZJZL,"I realize this is a novella, but....why is an author of this caliber wasting her time doing these? There is not enough time to develop characters or to put much into it in the way of plot or scenes. Scenes! Where are the scenes?? All we get is a few orders and a spanking. I know the heroine is new at D/s, but gee! And this is for $3.00. I would rather pay more and get a fully developed book where there is time to develop a good story about a Dom leading a new sub into D/s. With all the tensions of a military life, it could be quite an interesting book. I'M NOT BUYING ANY MORE NOVELLAS! It's the word equivalent of a 10 minute quickie at lunchtime. Not worth it unless you're really desperate."

2013-09-30,B008HX72DU,5.0,Great Home Workout Guide,A2JZCZYHNQHSCP,I was impressed to see the instructional photos for starters. No guessing how to do an exercise by having to read a bunch of text. People don't realize how easy it is to workout home and feel they need a full gym before they can make any improvements. This book dispels this myth.As a weight loss coach and author ofWeight Loss Domination Diet Your Guide To Losing 45 Pounds In 12 Weeks (How To Lose Weight Your Way)I always have clients asking me about what type of exercises they can do at home to help lose weight. Now I have a great resource to send them to.If you need some simple at home workouts I would recommend checking out this book.
2013-12-3,B008HYPD58,5.0,Great take on a Greek myth!,A2INLIJLUR30TI,"Let it be known that I'm pretty sure I have never disliked Greek myth or retelling. Persephone is a modern retelling of just that, the story of Persephone and Hades and how she became the Queen of the Underworld, however give me a chance to tell you why I think you will love this story too. This isn't your ancient story about a grumpy old God who is just bitter that he doesn't rule Olympus. In fact at this point Olympus has fallen and I don't mean some B movie involving Gerard Butler, a lot of the gods died long before Persephone was born and even longer before she knows who she is really becoming.Surprised by her mother Demeter that she is, in fact, a goddess and going to be coming into her powers as she reaches the age of adulthood, you can imagine the roller coaster of emotions that she has to deal with and then she gets attacked, only to be saved by the Lord of Darkness himself, Hades. The only way to do that, however, is to marry her and make her the Queen. Goddess, powers, attack and now queen, happy birthday to you, Persephone. All of this can understandably by a little overwhelming for a 17 year old but she actually takes it very well, which surprisingly felt alright reading it. I guess that's what made me like her so much, the fact that she found things out, processed them like a normal person and then accepted what was going on and found a way to deal. That isn't easy to do with a character and in this case it is successful. She is a goddess but Persephone feels like you and me. She isn't over the top or unapproachable and that's what made this story great. However, aking a great lead and mixing them with an awesome ensemble makes a story even better.Hades for me was the greatest part of the other characters. He is so different than other recreations I have read of him that he was interesting from the start. As we get to know him more, however, is where he really shines. Really all of the Underworld characters where great from Cassandra, Thanatos and Charon to even just the structure of the place itself made for a great place for the main characters to interact and definitely helped the story. It had lots of action and fun just like some popular series like Percy Jackson but this brought an element of both romance and realness to the Gods themselves that it made it a complete package for me. I am really looking forward to book 2!"
2013-07-13,B008IT6RK2,5.0,I really liked the short stories in this book,A2M1QYOWLBGRHT,I really liked the short stories in this book.Thank you so very much for writing the short stories in this book.
2012-11-9,B008IU9SSE,3.0,Left Me Confused,A2E9HDZXQORZLA,"It started with a kiss. Claire Montoya is a woman who fought her way out of a hardscrabble life and kept right on fighting through her enlistment and into a commission. She's a woman who follows only those rules she deems valid. Evan Loehr is a West Point grad, a by-the-book poster boy for the elite military man. He lives for and by all the rules, no questions, no evasions.From the moment they kissed they knew, absolutely knew, how incendiary their attraction was. And how completely unsuited they were for each other.Their professional relationship has grown more and more contentious as the years passed. Claire and Evan do not get along. Neither has forgotten that one moment of passion three years ago, but now that they're working together, they can't afford to dwell on it. It's a pity that knowing that and living it are two very different things.Colorado in winter is Claire's version of hell, but dealing with Army bureaucracy while trying to train a company for Iraqi deployment is definitely one of the lower levels. Nothing about the Army's focus for this training session makes sense to Claire, and nothing she says or does sways Evan in the least. It's enough to drive her out of her mind. It's enough to scare her senseless, too, because poorly trained soldiers are dead soldiers.If Claire takes matters into her own hands, she'll be forced to wage a personal war on the one man in all of Colorado who could keep her warm during the snowy nights, because for all his many, many...many faults, the fact is that Captain Evan Loehr is both a hell of a soldier and a hell of a man. She's left with no good options and a troubling bottom line: if she risks her career she could potentially save lives, but she'll definitely lose her heart.~*~I'm so confused. It's been a few months since I read series (and Scott's authorial) debut,Because of You, but I haven't forgotten that the expectations and assumptions I'd made about that book prior to reading it affected my impression of it. It was a much weightier, emotionally intense read than I was expecting, so I prepared myself for this one. Expected angst. Had tissues standing by. I was ready.Yeah, well, Scott threw me again. This time, though, I feel a little lost. On the bright side, I liked the characters well enough, and I was much fonder of Evan than I was of Shane in the first book. There wasn't an overload of angsty emotional landmines in the characters' personal lives or relationship, either. Some might consider that a bad thing, but I was happy about it. The first book was just too heavy for me, especially as I was expecting a sexy, light read (the cover of that book did me no favors in that regard).Problem is, for all that I liked the characters in this book, they weren't the characters I was expecting, nor was the storyline what I'd thought it was going to be. The first book left several plot threads dangling and posed a very grim glimpse into the lives of two secondary characters whose marriage was crumbling. At the conclusion of that book, I figured that was going to be a storyline that was carried over to serve as a cohesive element in the series.I was wrong, because unless I'm mistaken or have forgotten something, there was not one single character crossover between book one and two and no story threads that were picked up and continued from there into this one. There was, however, an opening sequence that was startlingly similar to the beginning of the previous book, and not in a good way. Small details were changed, but the entire dynamic was far too similar and put this book on a shaky foundation for me from the start.You will get no argument from me about the fact that Scott can write. She paints a cohesive, detailed picture of military life that is intriguing and disturbing at turns, and as often frustrating and perplexing as humbling and amazing. The psychology of career military personnel is captured perfectly as her stories unfold. The Army itself is portrayed as having a few...idiosyncrasies that are completely realistic and utterly believable. And more than a little scary.I do wish there had been less emphasis placed on the scheduling snafu as the main conflict in this book. I absolutely believe it's an accurate representation of similar real-life situations, but it was belabored throughout the first half of the book to the point that character discussion and arguments over the issue became repetitive, and as a main plot conflict I felt it lacked complexity and depth.The issue with Claire's best friend's alcoholism was also emphasized a little too much for me. Initially I was bothered because the character seemed a little too similar to a secondary character in the first book, but as his drinking problem became a larger issue, that became less of a point. It astounded me that so little was done to address what was a massive problem, especially for a soldier facing time in the sandbox. So many rules were broken to protect him that I couldn't fathom the ""friendship"" justification.Not only was his character hugely unsympathetic to me through most of the book, but more troubling was my dissatisfaction with Claire's hypocritical reactions to his alcohol abuse. I would think that a man that messed up is no less deadly to himself and surrounding soldiers than one who is poorly trained. It didn't speak well of her character that she hadn't addressed that fact at any point.As far as romantic arcs go, the one between Claire and Evan was handled well. It felt more like what I consider a traditional romance than the arc in the previous book. Sometimes Claire's prickly personality annoyed me, and sometimes Evan's frustratingly rigid stance made me want to kick his shin, but overall, their relationship was satisfying, sexy, and entertaining. It was probably the highlight of the read for me.I don't know what to make of this series at this point. I'm disappointed that the threads left dangling in the first book weren't picked up, and because they weren't, I don't know that they ever will be. That cast a pall over both reads for me. If the series continues along with each book as disconnected as the first two, and the emotional tone of the series continues to vacillate so wildly with such unpredictability, then it won't matter how pleasant the main characters' romance is or how realistic the portrayal of military life, I will be disinclined to soldier along with it.Disclosure: An ARC of this book was provided to me by Loveswept publisher Random House Publishing Group via NetGalley.

2013-02-25,B008IXE5DO,4.0,Witty romp through urban angst,A1DG765BZAZZQ,"Using very witty dialogue betwixt the characters, the author exposes a gaggle of urban neuroses as experienced by a rather depressed young chap who can't seem to make a proper choice.  I found myself wanting to reach through the pixels on my reader to shake the protagonist by the lapels.  Mr Higgins has a great ear and ability to infuse the conversations of the supporting characters with wit and biting humor.  A fun read overall."

One of my favorite movies is ""Cutthroat Island"", but even viewing that & ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" did not prepare me for these books!  The author did an excellent job of making me feel that I personally knew each of the characters in these books!!!  I hope there is a third book coming soon...will be anxiously awaiting one!!"

Character development is excellent, and Mike Kraus writes in a way that really pulls you into the story. The serial format works well and has a way of leaving you on the edge of your seat to see what happens next. Final Dawn is certainly a page turner.If you have not yet read episode 1 you need to grab that one first. And if you have read episode 1 and thought it ended with a shocking cliffhanger you are in for a treat at the end of episode 2.Now I need to grab episode 3. Looks like I will have some more reading to do this evening."
2013-04-18,B008V2B1XY,4.0,"Interesting characters, complex monsters, and almost fairy-tale like themes",AVRN2OVEEGX16,"A tale of elves, vampires, dragons, and more, Dark Children of Naor is a collection of three tales that take us from the frozen wastes of the north, to the vineyards and courts of the south, all in a land called Naor. What Justyna Plichta-Jendzio has crafted here is a work of classic/traditional fantasy that weaves together interesting characters, complex monsters, and almost fairy-tale like themes.It's also a tale of strong women - monsters, hunters, and heroes alike - who surpass their traditional roles by putting a new spin on them. In the first tale, a beautiful young woman must do battle with the exterminators sent to hunt her down, while fighting against the darkness of her very nature. It's a very traditional vampire story with an edge . . . literally. The second tale turns the tables, making a woman the hunter, hot on the trail (no pun intended) of the dragon who decimated her family. She's a great character, but it's the mythology of the dragons - the velangs - that really intrigued me.The third tale is the longest of the lot, and the one that really takes us into the mythology and philosophy of Justyna's world. It's also the story with the most depth in terms of setting, introducing us to the highs and lows of society - the rich, the poor, the nobles, and the slaves. While the first two stories were largely straightforward, with a nice twist at the end, this is a tale that's built on betrayals. The introduction of more spiritual themes, of angels and demons, is an odd expansion of the traditional fantasy genre, but one that works.All told, these are strong stories, with interesting characters, that are well-told. I would have liked to see a bit of framing around them, something to either link them together or establish them within the larger worldview, but that's a minor quibble. I enjoyed my time in Naor, and would definitely be up for a return visit."

I love the way it is written and it had a steady pace. They were short, but good. Some books you don't need them to be 300 pages to tell a good story.

2012-12-7,B0092MPUNY,3.0,A good story with a very interesting storyline,A3IT9Z7O9IK7BM,"For me, this is one of those books that could have gone either way in the rating department. Although it had all the elements I love to have in a story, I can't help but think that there was something missing. I loved the concept the author, Libby Drew, brought forward - how a normal man goes from everyday life, to a life where his only purpose is to save people. Jase's journey through this ordeal was a trying one. Imagine not knowing your name, your age, or having no idea what you are supposed to do and running from place to place saving strangers. I could not blame him for how he felt - confused, tired and at times thinking about ending it all. It wasn't until he meets a man who helps him understand his mission better that he finally gets to see a blip of light at the end of the tunnel.So he goes about his mission, looking forward to that long-awaited number 40. And all hell breaks loose. He meets Lucas and Macy, his last soul to save. After some very interesting events, the three of them find themselves on the run. And here is where Lucas and Jase really connect with each other and form a bond with Macy too. I loved the dynamic between them because it felt believable. Lucas was adorable. His humor and sarcasm alone won me over. And Macy, well, she broke my heart. She was a trooper throughout it all.Then she is kidnapped and Jase's mission is compromised or so he thought. This is where the story dragged me down. I understand Lucas and Jase had to look at all the angles, but it felt too slow for my taste. I found myself skimming through it and going right to the dialog. In the end I didn't need all that narrative to know who was behind it all. I won't get into it much because I really don't want to give anything away. I'll just say that the author had me wondering what the hell was happening up to this point and within a couple of pages into Lucas and Jase's investigation I had it all figured out.Now the resolution to the plot as a whole was another story. It wasn't a bad resolution to the plot at all and I was not expecting it in the least, but it felt...lacking? I don't know if that's even the right word. But I was expecting something with a bit more punch. But maybe it's just me.All that said, I do have to say that the author really made the most out of the characters and their situation. They were funny and adorable and I liked them right away. She also went about Lucas and Jase's connection the right way. Anything more and their story would have been unbelievable to me and anything less would have made me lose my interest. I enjoyed their constant banter, their tender moments and how they grew throughout the story. I found the ending to be a bit abrupt but I liked it nonetheless.All in all, a good story with a very interesting storyline, a very intriguing mystery and great characters with some chemistry thrown in to the mix make it more enjoyable."
2013-08-21,B0092QBP8Y,4.0,Interesting novella,AXBPOMEELERLZ,"Radiant is a quick read, a short novella chronologically set between Hallowed and Boundless, the next book in the series.  The majority of this one is centered on Angela, a character that I have been wanting more of.  She has more angel blood than Clara, but often seems to be less of an angel.  It didn't really progress the main story line of Clara, but it definitely explained a lot about Angela and why she is the way she is.There has always been a bit of an oddness about Angela, something that just seemed suspicious.  This novella didn't change that feeling for me, but instead deepened it.  I am not quite sure on which side she falls and she keeps me guessing!  I am betting that is frustrating a lot of fans, but I like the mystery it provides the story as a series.I think you could probably read Boundless without having read this and not miss anything essential.  But there is one pivotal scene in Radiant that is later referenced in Boundless.  But it is explained and described well enough in the book that it is completely understandable, even if you hadn't read this novella.Things to love about Radiant...--The focus on Angela.  We learn a lot about her.  She may still be mysterious, but she also seems a lot more human in this novella.  Ironic, I know, since she is an angel!My recommendation:  Not absolutely essential to the series, but worth the read!"

Knowing twists are coming keep me on my toes at all times.A Textbook Case features the standard cast of characters in the Lincoln Rhyme series via a short story format that obviously requires them to solve the case in even a quicker fashion since the pages are limited.  The story jumps right into the first crime and the investigation for evidence which is standard for a Rhyme/Sachs book is off and running.  There is a distinctiveness to this series whereby if the names were removed, I'd immediately would still know the author and the series.I am not a huge fan of short stories and I try to rate them on being shorts.  While this book was a mini extension of the series, I didn't feel the wow factor that I have received many times with a book from this series.  The twists were there but either I predicted them or didn't think they were 'twisty' enough.Figuring out a Jeffery Deaver book has become very difficult over the years.  He really hides the clue that still makes it a fair game to figure out the perp.  Same for this book.Great price for a decent length short story from one of the best in the business!"
2013-07-2,B00937EXPO,5.0,Foundation in Cooking,A33CHZ92ABKY97,"The basics for food storage and the equipment and tools which the author uses herself form an significant part of this book. A comprehensive list of foods and recommended length of refrigerator or freezer storage is extremely helpful. Great stress is laid on the necessity for freshness and purity of ingredients, not only for taste purpose but also for safe nutritional value.  This book lays a foundation for a cooking series covering the topics in detail."

2014-02-11,B0093MGNV6,4.0,Lies Catch Up to You and In the End Can Be the Best Thing That Ever Happened For Ben,A3MT311233OHMQ,"I have come to enjoy this storyline I shall call 'marrying under the influence'.  Truly, Vegas is a dangerous place to be if you can't hold your liquor after you've picked up a date for the night.  At least that's my observation after reading three romance novels with that being the case.This is one that if I had paid close attention to the gist of the story before I picked it up; I probably wouldn't have read it.  I'm not big on cheating and this whole story is a result of a guy lying and cheating.  It turned out that I wasn't as upset by the cheating as I usually am because of what else was going on in the story and its lighter tone.  I'm not saying the ends justify the means, but in this case, everyone was much happier as a result of the things his misdemeanors set in motion so I went with it and ended up enjoying the story.Ben wakes up in his hotel room after a very debauched night on the town in Vegas and looks around with a feeling of dread on top of the hangover.  As he moves about practically tripping over the used condoms and empty bottles, he realizes that not only did he cheat on his girlfriend, but he cheated on her with a man.His best bud and co-conspirator, Lucas, tells him they'll keep it a secret and Genevieve need never know.  Lucas thinks Genevieve isn't the woman for Ben and tells him so all the time.  Ben secretly agrees on one level, but he also likes her enough to feel awful about things.  He and Lucas return to NYC to their jobs for the architect firm owned by Ben's dad and hopefully back to normal.  Ben tries to pretend.  Everything reminds him of Mason, the man he was with, including when he is intimate with Genevieve.  This drives him to guiltily propose to Genevieve.  He should be happy, but it feels all hollow and wrong.  He wants to love Genevieve and she makes his dad happy and he likes her too though he admits to himself that they tend to do just fine going their separate ways with her fashion design work and his job at the firm.  She doesn't stir him to passion anymore than he seems to stir her.  She redesigned his apartment suite and seems to want to do the same thing with his life.  They've just been drifting until now.Life gets a bit more complicated when he no sooner discovers the receipt for his marriage to Mason then Mason is standing on his doorstep.  Ben wants to get rid of him even as he is secretly still attracted.  Mason discovers about Genevieve and blackmails Ben into letting him stay.  He will keep quiet about their marriage and pretend to be Ben's brother if Ben will let him stay long enough to find a dancing job on Broadway.  Ben has no choice if he doesn't want his lies to catch up with him.  Gen and Mason bristle around each other and Ben feels the discomfort of being stuck in the middle.  He grows more and more confused about what he wants with Genevieve and with life in general since he never wanted to be an architect.  Genevieve goes off to Paris for a fashion show leaving the two men alone for a week.  Ben tries to deny his feelings and attraction for Mason, but the longer they spend together it gets harder to avoid and deny.  A crisis comes that wakes him up and forces him to stop lying, but he might have put it off for too long now that Mason took him at his word and is gone.I had some real issues with this story- primarily the cheating and lying, but these were balanced out with some stuff I liked too.  Ben is the narrator and he was not a favorite of mine particularly from the beginning.  There wasn't a great deal to like or respect.  Let's just say he had a ton of growing to do, but fortunately he does end up growing.  He got himself into the mess he was in and when I say that I mean that he sat back and let his dad dictate his career to him because he wanted to please his dad, then he let Genevieve dictate how things were going to be in their relationship and private life and then he got so drunk that he married a stranger in Vegas.  He just seemed to be helpless about stuff, but then having Mason around seemed to give him a little more impetus to change.  Not as much as I would have liked because he tended to avoid further communication and confrontation with his dad and Genevieve that got things sticky again.  I didn't care for Genevieve and she had her own issues, but Ben didn't handle things well with her either.  He was Mason's hero and Mason loved him, but he just wasn't hero material to me much of the time.Now that being said, I did enjoy watching Ben grow a bit and experience a true relationship for the first time with Mason.  Mason wouldn't let Ben get away with his fallback behaviors of denying and lying.  He forced Ben to be his true self and analyze his life.  Mason is a gentle soul, but he is not afraid to go out and grab hold to what he wants and what would make him happy.  He doesn't think well of himself, but Ben was good about seeing Mason's worth and making it clear that he did.  Ben's always had things handed to him on a silver platter, but now he has someone who needs him and needs him to take care of them.  He likes that feeling and was starting to move in a good direction by the end of the book.  They really are good for each other.I enjoyed that side story with Ben's friend Lucas too.  Lucas gave it to Ben straight and that cyber dating he did with Laura just cracked me up.So in the end, I was pleased with the overall story and would recommend it to those who enjoy lighter M/M Contemporary Romance."
2013-05-25,B0094FZZGG,3.0,Too Many of the same,A34VIO4RJJAXBN,"This book is good, but there's too many variations of just a few recipes. It would have been a much better book had she added more recipes instead of just variations of a couple of recipes."
2014-05-17,B0094Z4NIC,2.0,I couldn't waste any more time,AAG2N9TJTFNM2,"I skipped to the end when I was at the 40% mark, I just didn't want to waste any more time on this book. It follows the chick lit formula and has swearing and sex and was just not for me."
2013-08-4,B00957XZFG,3.0,Good read,A12CN239SWGFO4,"I love old houses, romance, kids and cats. I recommend this book yo anyone else with similar likes in a story. It could have done with a little more mystery and suspense but was still a sweet story."
2013-08-17,B0095BV5FO,5.0,Good Book,A25IY18DI5XNYK,"This is one of those easy to read books that are entertaining and challenging. Even though it was easy to see Lucas was a crook from the beginning, the way he was dealt with and the final solution was good. I wish Emily wasn't so shield wishey washey about everything though. She seems to be in such a hurry to think the worst of everyone. It seems that friends should at least get a chance to prove themselves before paranoia makes everyone suspect. But even so it was a good book and I am getting the next book in the series as soon as I finish this review."
2012-12-17,B0095IATR2,5.0,The start of events,A1EA7VXIUZBYIK,"An ancient language, uniquely different army soldiers, mysterious sounds and happenings. And more.Welcome to a city of screams, and a great set-up for James Rollins' future book, The Blood Gospel.I could definitely tell James was involved in this story since some of the characters were pretty much like his own Sigma Force heroes (especially like Gray and Monk). Since I've never read anything by Rebecca Cantrell, I can't draw any conclusions, just guesses.Here's the gist: a group of scientists go into an area with a deep history, go blackout (missing). A group of soldiers is sent to find the scientists and find something far worse. A strange girl is found and weird things start to happen.The start was really great, the historical background (which comes with Rollins' territory in his research for his books) was immense and deeply satisfying for one who has an interest in obscure history (like me), the occassional quirky dialogue did, at times, get me to snort-laugh (especially the weight jokes one fat soldier throws around about himself), and the mystique of the dead language mentioned, the mystery of the little girl, and what happens in the cave at the end of the story, along with the questions the main character thinks about at the very end, it's all a great start to pique interests to what already seems to promise to be a complex and intriguing series."
2012-09-30,B0095ZIODQ,4.0,Yummy!,A3RKG7R8ODW0K5,"I love beef, and I love my slow cooker, so I was anxious to get this book. I was not disappointed. The author offers a nice variety of recipes, and the only difficult part is choosing which one to try first! I look forward to trying out more of them."
2013-11-26,B0097BB930,5.0,AWESOME,A1JRRDS066HDXP,AWESOME read  can't wait to read the rest of the series inthis collection of books from this author WOW WOw
2012-10-8,B0097DKI4E,5.0,Let Me Serve you,A2BOMXBW2YF10L,I loved this IR story about Leighton and Charlie. Charlie was sexy and great alpha male. Leighton was weak in the beginning but she be came stronger with each page. Things like this do happen to women. I liked how they got together. It is not always about hot sex on page 3. I recommend this book to all you ladies.
2013-01-23,B0097DW1JO,3.0,90 Days Probation,A3AEUC1KPG4YBX,"The beginning of this book, about a young woman with a ""too nice"" complex, was choppy and seemed to rush, which almost caused me to not read it entirely. The topic of rising in the midst of domestic violence almost got lost within some parts of the book. But overall, it was a decent read."
2013-11-22,B0097GFOS6,5.0,KEEPS YOU GUESSING,A32AYZRCF0P8YR,"THIS WAS A MORE THAN GOOD READ. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE OF J&B SERIES. I WILL BE LOOKING FOR MORE FROM THIS AUTHOR. I LIKE MYSTERIES THAT KEEP ME GUESSING, AND I SURE DID NOT SEE THE &#34;WHO DONE IT&#34; IN THIS ONE."
2012-10-7,B0097LJ8FG,5.0,A great read!,A3NZGJILXK8907,"I really enjoyed this book. I loved the romance and the comedic elements were adorable. Baz was such an endearing hero and I was so happy that he got his happy ending. The setting was great too. A must read for anyone who likes a bit of suspense, diverse characters and a good romance that tickles the funny bone."
2013-03-25,B0097LTX8S,4.0,Dallas BIllionaires,A2EDQH1P9V8WZ3,I loved this story. I would have liked to read more about their wedding and their children. A few more about their life.
2013-02-23,B0097SVF1Y,4.0,Feeling Texty?,A2428MCHNII361,"I remember those when the texting first began to get really popular and ever so often a friend would sent a really cheeky text but by time you decide to forward it to the person you liked, he or she would have gotten the same text from several people. It was difficult then to really flirt with someone using text messages.If sending a chain message did not get you down then perhaps hitting the send button only to realize that you have sent the message to the wrong person, more than likely would. Texting can be dangerous but there in lies the lure. Anything that has an element of danger to it is sure to get your curiosity peaked.Now we are in the age of the social media revolution with a million ways of talking to someone without actually doing it face to face. I have had the very amusing experience of having someone text me while we were sitting at the same table having a conversation with a few other companions. At first I thought it was a bit ridiculous but then it got interesting when my mate sent me a very sensual message that I did not know quite how to respond to at the time.I was 'text' challenged and I have been that way for quite some time, so finding this book was very interesting for me. It's a bit late because I would have liked to have had it when I was dating but not now that I am married it makes for good fun. I think sending my husband spicy text that ought to get him heated while he is at work is sure to get me some serious action when he gets home. With all that built up tension, I am certain that he will be like a volcano, ready to erupt when he walks through the door.This book was of great help for composing those steamy texts to tease my husband and I am sure it will help anyone desirous of doing the same with their partners. It's 'Sexting' and whether you send it from the phone, facebook, twitter or some other social site that you and your made subscribes to, you better prepare for the end result which will more than likely culminate with you staring at the ceiling and your mate looking you intently in the eyes. The rest I will leave up to your imagination.Every bit of humor that was intentionally included was very much appreciated. Sandra gives you 20 ways of keeping things interesting. My favorite has to be Lunch Hour Sexting, simply because it's usually all the time I have during the work day to be frisky with my huzzy.If you are already a pro at this then I don't think you will be amazed with the content of this book. But if you are a novice like me and a terrible 'Sexter' then you stand to gain a lot from reading this book."
2012-12-15,B00984N9L6,4.0,NEW COMMUNICATION,AV2PDQNTBTPWH,"Here he comes again! Stephen Williams goes through communication matter once again, and this time he does it with a guide for men.Infact he hopes to help them ""picking-up"" women.If you are a woman, you will surely enjoy reading ""Funny Pick-up Lines"", discovering men's weaknesses and fears.I guess that Williams wrote this book to help men who don't know how to approach women in different cirrcumstances and places; reading the chapters, reader will discover new ways to solve his communication problem: you will realise that Williams has a great sense of humor, which men can use with ladies.Well, in some cases women could think this method doesn't work, but let's laugh at this!Humor is very important for Williams, so it should be for everyone, helping people face seemingly difficult situations.I had fun reading Williams' tips and advice, because I thought that many men should start feeling more comfortable with themselves, learning how to increase their self-esteem, in particular relating to women.Yes, because as we have always seen in most Stephen Williams' books, according to him, communication is the most important part of human relationhships of every kind, a part of love relationships: so, once again, through ""Funny Pick-up Lines"", he suggests readers to start living differently, knowing and approaching women in a funny way.It almost seems that you're on the scene, witnessing women's reactions to men's humorous way to approach them.So, if you need to know further about this nice and funny subject, buy a copy of Stephen Williams' ""Funny Pick-up Lines""!"
2012-09-17,B009AHT1HC,5.0,A chilling horror novella,A23MQW2Q7T46JB,"It was suppose to be a fun winter night touring the back roads with old friends, but a tree blocks the trail and the old truck breaks down. There's no light, warmth, or cell phone reception. Cassie, Mary, Denise, and James decide to walk the few miles back to the main road. The cold and darkness adds friction to an already disgruntled group, and Cassie's scary story doesn't help ease the tension. There's also something stalking them in the woods. Perhaps Cassie's story holds more truth than they want to believe.Cherie Reich has managed to pack vivid detail and nail-biting suspense in this short horror tale. I can still feel the cold and hear the strange cracks from the woods. It seemed like a normal night for the young folk, but I fast on the edge of my seat, and I couldn't relax even when I reached the end. The most unique part of this story is that the reader is allowed to see through all the characters' eyes. Each of the four characters have their own sections and it's like peeling back layers of an onion. More is revealed about the dynamics of the group and each individual's inner most feelings. Cherie does a marvelous job with characterization. This is the perfect story for a cold, dark night when you're bundled up in bed. You'll need a big blanket when those chilly goose bumps crawl up your arms!"
2013-01-6,B009BII0XQ,4.0,Another good one,A2SFTC96J32E5H,"It's amazing how much your emotions go up and down in this book. I was angry with Matt at first then I was back to being in love with him and then I'd repeat with Shannon. I love the whole best friends scenario. I think everyone has had a best friend that they have felt like this with and it's just nice to see it come true. I hated it took so long for them to figure out how they felt, but then again if you're friends and in a situation like this it'll take time.Ancelli, you could write 5 more stories all about friends and I can guarantee you that I will read them. Nice job. Loved it."
2012-12-6,B009CQT09A,2.0,Not worth the money but not horrible,A3C8LCRG0BGFFX,"I felt the book was boring and predictable it would've been ok had it been 99 cents, but for 2.99 I felt it was not worth it.  It wasn't a horrible story, the idea was ok but I found myself skimming and STILL being able to predict outcomes, there weren't any real surprises and if i were u i'd save my money, mayb check out some of R.L. Mathewson's books, they're hilarious."
2013-02-20,B009DADXR0,3.0,Not bad,A7FLSHSCHY99C,I found that there were too many recipes with products I've never heard of. They weren't  recipes I would use very often as well.
2012-09-21,B009DVJ3O6,5.0,Great recipes!,A1V2DAMGMHPQNZ,"This book has some really great recipes! Anyone who loves chicken and is looking to spice things up while keeping it healthy, should buy this book. There are several stir fry recipes that are absolutely wonderful, as well as some BBQ recipes and soup recipes. I would highly recommend this book."
2012-10-21,B009E7TX08,5.0,worthy successor to the ingenarii,A170L669BMNTFI,"My first 5 star rating in a long time. Kestrel is part elf, part human, caught in a developing elf-human conflict as war and evil envelops the land. Chosen as champion by both human gods and elf gods, Kestrel is thrown into the conflict without a clear sense of direction. Maybe a basic plot but Jeff Quyle's style elevates the story to a 4 or 5 star level, depending on personal interest. If you haven't read Quyle's Ingenarii series yet, start it now and if you liked the ingenarii, you'll love this."
2013-03-6,B009ECEKVK,3.0,Good for beginner introvert reading?,A1T7N165U2HJAC,"I found this book fairly helpful but have known I've been an introvert for a very long time. This book would help people who don't know for sure if they are an introvert but notice a difference in their personality.  Amber Keyes explains different techniques you can use in order to fit in with the extroverts and get your job done. And for being a great boss, well that takes skills you can learn from management courses. If you are not good at getting into other peoples faces and visa versa then become your own boss somehow or work at another level.  At times in the book she  practically gives you step by step directions on what to do in certain situations.  This may come in handy one day if you can remember them, but given her line of work, explaining what she does to get through the day would not help anyone unless they had the same job.  I have read a few books on being an introvert and I have come to the conclusion that there is no special way to know the situations you will get into that makes you feel uncomfortable whether an introvert or extrovert. Just be yourself and don't be so hell bent to fit in everywhere. There are a lot of extroverts that are introverts and at the end of their day I'm sure they are mentally exhausted. I truly don't want to have to stay on my P's & Q's to make sure all is well with my relationship to the world and the people in it. I believe the only advantage to being an introvert is that you have more creativity and you give your thoughts to more than just how many friends you can collect on Face Book. Science and technology are ruled by introverts. So I say don't categorize yourself into one group or the other because YOU are YOU.  As the book suggested, you may need to hone your skills for small talk in order to be polite but hopefully it may turn into a small, interesting talk, you never know. It's been known to happen."
2013-07-30,B009EEOWOS,4.0,Book of Ruth,A3CIIU9YNK53VK,Thanks for sharing this story with the children. My son enjoyed learning more about Ruth through this book to go along with the learning he has done through church.
2013-03-18,B009FHONVG,5.0,Outstanding!,A3OMSDR1PLQCHX,"When I first opened the book ""Open House"" by Krystal Shannon and saw the name ""Aphrodite"" I knew it was going to be amazing! Aphrodite is the goddess of love and in this book we see as she watches over two humans and their love story.  Rebecca and Robert were two humans who met at an open house only to realize that they have known each other since high school.Now, I totally can't say anything else about it because I don't want to spoil it but when Aphrodite's plan for love becomes a game with Ares, the god of war, things become heated. You totally need to read this book on your own to see just how amazing and awesome it is. Having Aphrodite and Ares together, fighting over the souls and both working their magic over these humans lives makes the book so much more interesting.  The human characters as so well developed that you can easily fall in love with them and then become angry when Ares interferes. Oh I just adore this book!It isn't just your standard love story. It's a love story with an incredible twist since everything can be changed when dealing with the gods. I highly recommend this story for anyone who loves romance. There are two wonderful romance stories happening at once and it is just amazing how it is laid out. It is extremely addicting and well done that I couldn't put it down until I finished it.  I've never seen anything like it before and I've already got the next one to read!  I give this story five wonderfully deserved stars."
2014-04-6,B009FHSYSY,5.0,AMAZING!!!!!!!!,A1J2HFAH8EXK50,Wow I have so many emotions flowing through me I can't even think straight. This book is just WOW the characters are unbelievably written. I was on pins and needles through most of it. Yelling at Emma to tell Jackson what Claire had said so long ago. This book is definitely worth reading. It's a pretty long one too which I totally enjoy. Read this book you'll thoroughly enjoy it.
2013-06-15,B009G9LJKG,2.0,Hmmmm...SPOILERS!!!!,AVGYENZU56KBR,"Ummm...he slept with your aunt!!!!! Why would you want to be with someone who could not see past her BS exterior to the cold and heartless woman underneath. He just wanted a pretty face and slept with the aunt for a while before the heroine came along. He still was around the aunt even though he had feelings for the heroine and I am not sure if he was still sleeping with the aunt after he first started hanging out with the heroine!!!! It was not specific with that detail. He felt that it would embarrass the aunt if he just left her and seemed to shun her in public so he still was around her at balls and stuff but that confused and hurt the heroine...you know, the girl you are supposed to be in love with??? It was an annoying book."

How intriguing!Since I'm a lover of Fantasy, I began to read and found I couldn't put it down.What fun!This is a great imaginative adventure. The characters are delightful, the story witty and well thought-out.I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys the thrill of an imaginative read filled with danger, triumph and courage. There's someone in here for every reader, come see who you identify with! :)"

2013-08-21,B009HX98X6,5.0,The Circle of Ceridwen,A1FUJQKBNQ3ASO,I love the way Octavia writes. It is an interesting story line and yet she manages to explain different way that people probably lived in other times and countries. Her descriptions are precise and interesting at the same time. She fully explains each of her characters in a way that is interesting and not overly long..Can't wait to start reading  Ceridwen of Kilton which is book two of this series. I even got a personal email from this fascinating woman.Thank you for a great read!

2013-02-3,B009KGAF9Q,5.0,Loved it!!!,A26RYJ8KBHMH5Q,This was a great book from the 1st page.  Ebony was just to darn trifling and Ivory was to naive.  I really liked Jah's character and i felt bad that things had to end the way they did.  I felt so sorry for poor Calvin Jr. having to deal with such a heartless mother day to day.  Overall this was a wonderful read!! Job well done Jade Jones!!
2012-12-7,B009L2X8KM,5.0,Great Prequel,AUO23N5SQWOVE,"The only disappointment about this book is that it is not long enough, Good to read about Gus again, buy this and it will introduce the reader to Augustus Berry ""A Good Man"""
2012-11-20,B009MBUW8I,2.0,Good concept but failed execution,A3RTEP0OMSWW5B,"I am always a little hesitant to write a review that is less than complimentary of a book. I am not in the business of bashing authors because I don't personally like their book. And, I want to be supportive of independent and relatively unknown authors. That being said, when I read a book like this, I feel that it is my job as a reviewer to set aside the possible hurt feelings of the author and tell my readers my honest opinion.I so wanted to like this book. The premise sounded interesting: A girl begins to see some kind of supernatural being (fairies or sprites) after a near death experience. She falls in love with one of them despite the danger involved for both of them. Forbidden love, a hot fairie guy, danger - what's not to like, right? Wrong...First, the writing. There were a lot of awkward sentences, some misused idioms, overuse of certain phrases, words that were technically correct but not ""current"" and sentences that just plain did not make sense. Now, this could be the case for one of 2 reasons:One, the author is originally from Poland and is not a native English speaker - thus the problems listed above. If this is the case I would recommend that she find a native English speaker or editor to help her polish this up. Two, the main character is originally from Russia and would therefore likely speak in broken English. The book was written in first person present tense so the entire book is right from her mind/mouth. If this is the reason for the above problems, I understand wanting to keep the character authentic, but the language really detracted from my enjoyment of the book. I would recommend that the book not be written in first-person from Ania's point of view.Second, the plot. There were a ton of inconsistencies and holes in this plot that made me go ""Huh? Whaaaat?"" For example, Gabriel (the Sprite love interest) states on more than one occasion that it is against the rules for them to be together and that the penalty for them speaking is death. However, he also states on more than one occasion that this has never ever happened before, in all the centuries that they have existed. If this is true, why would such a rule even exist? In the last couple of pages there's an event that seems like a heck of a coincidence. I won't say more as I don't want to spoil anything but suffice it to say that the particular scene was inconsistent and seemed like it was added in almost as an afterthought to make the storyline work.Third, I really hated Ania. She is the main character so I suppose one would expect to feel some kind of connection there but I just did not like the girl. She was completely immature and a major drama queen. She has an overbearing mother, but her mother obviously cares about her. It's not an abusive relationship or anything. At one point in the book Ania cuts all ties with her and states that she is ""just another woman named Natasha that I once knew."" That seems quite extreme to me. Also, she sees Gabriel a couple of times and even admits (more than once) how arrogant he is. Yet, after the first time he kisses her she is ""in love!"" Ridiculous! She knows absolutely nothing about this guy (or Sprite, as the case may be), his culture, his family, etc.. but she's in love with him! She is also the QUEEN of mixed messages. She sends him away and then is angry when he's not there. He leaves for a trip and she's angry that he's gone. She was whiny, immature, overly dramatic and generally unlikeable.I gave an extra star for the overall idea of the book. I think if the writing were smoother and the plot and details fleshed out a little more this could be great. The idea of fairies as guardians instead of angels was intriguing to me. The very small glimpses I got of their society was intriguing to me. I can see the potential here and give the author credit for putting an original spin on the idea of fairies and angels.Overall, there were more negatives than positives for me personally. I was unable to overlook a lot of the awkward writing and plot inconsistencies. However, if you are looking for something a little different and like a good love story with a little bit of a mystery thrown in, you may enjoy this one.Note: I received a copy of this book for free from the author in exchange for my honest review.  All opinions are 100% my own."
2013-04-4,B009MZQP0I,5.0,Great read!,A4PNKH1PMPWS7,"Again, another great book by Mara Jacobs. I thought Debbie Macomber, Sherryl Woods, Robyn Carr and JD Robb couldn't be beat but Ms. Jacobs comes close."
2013-05-23,B009OGC8A6,5.0,A great read,A13YE4OX9U4O6M,I loved the humor and the situations that she got caught up in.  Enjoyable and fun read.  Would like to read more of Ms. Bennett's books.

2013-01-18,B009OX9V2W,4.0,The stories revolve around the common theme of a necklace found in various compromising situations - usually murder.,A3T3FN8389AUN3,"Note: I received a free copy of this book in return for my honest review.This anthology is marked as scary short stories, but I would classify the book more as a blend of sci-fi, mystery, and thriller. There is even some eyebrow raising humor mixed in there. The stories revolve around the common theme of a necklace found in various compromising situations - usually murder.I finished the anthology in a few sittings. About 99% of the stories were interesting to read and kept my attention. Having a variety of different authors and their styles one after the other made the book easy to read.My favorite story was &#34;The Needing&#34; by PJ Friel. I was instantly wrapped up in the story and loved the twisted, very wrong, but very right in a very wrong way (haha!), ending.One of the stories I simply skipped through because due to the violent, abusive nature of the repulsive main character (&#34;The Trophy Wife&#34; by Killion Slade). That is just my personal preference though; others might like the more horror, gory stories.I recommend this anthology for anyone who likes a mixed bag of writers and leans toward mystery or thriller novels."

2013-12-22,B009RBKTSG,5.0,A nice quick holiday read,A3P0G4HZN26M40,"Resa (Teresa) Madere has recently been dumped by her husband and is struggling to pay her mortgage. She heads home to Dogtown just before Christmas to help her Uncle Emile in the family sausage-making business. Dogtown is a small town whose residents belong to either the Madere or Caillou families. Its major attraction is the strange dog-like mascot, the rougarou, located in the center of town. Resa's sentiments about her home town can be summed up as follows: &#34;Dogtown was like quicksand; unless one kept moving, getting stuck was inevitable, followed by sinking and suffocation.&#34;Coincidentally, Resa's old school friend Chan (Chandler) Caillou has just moved back to Dogtown to take over his family's alligator wrangling business. He states, &#34;It was my responsibility, you know? Sometimes we're born into a situation and we have to decide if we're gonna be a part of it or if we're gonna put an end to it.&#34; According to both their families, Resa and Chan are destined to be married. Resa has never felt that way about Chan, but now that he's all grown up, she's not so sure. When Chan asks Resa out to the community dance, the town's tongues start wagging.What secret are both families hiding and how does it affect Resa and Chan? The future of both families is in her hands, and Resa has a decision to make.This is a magical tale not so much about Christmas but about love, family, and new beginnings. A nice quick holiday read.I received this book for the purpose of providing an honest review."

This guide does a great job of going over Pinterest from beginning to end and giving you the details you will need to succeed.  If you are new to Pinterest, or even if you have been on Pinterest for awhile, this is a great guide and will help increase your knowledge of this new social media giant."

2012-11-4,B009XFD60E,4.0,so good,A2UQGX6YMQ5BAL,This is a great book it gives a all around conclusion to all of the characters to both series. I was very impressed with how the author stayed true to what he wrote in the other series about how these characters felt and continued it on. This is about Jake still being in love with his college sweetheart and finally getting a second chance one that he is not willing to loose with his ex who claims to be pregnant with his child. I will not give away the ending it is just great to see it all come together for a heart filled ending.
2013-02-21,B009XGD2DY,3.0,Captivating,A1DPQ62TTCIG8L,"Interesting cast of characters in a book with unusual twists. Confusing at some points, but still an interesting story format"
2013-02-23,B009Y6OKPC,5.0,Good Read for all SciFi fans,A29EEQGMQI7DM6,"Any SciFi fan should enjoy reading this book.  The female lead character is very likable, intelligent and funny.  Linda Kay also make mistakes, however never the same one twice. The military structure in this world is unique to me.  Do not think the constant questioning of superior officers would be allowed in today's military.  Also, different than other Scifi military books this character's goal is to be a Starship Engineer and not a Ship's Captain."
2014-03-6,B009Y72FS0,5.0,Enforcers Redemption,A1O34DQL998ST7,Yet another great book by a great author.

It's the best one in the series, full of action and romance.  I read it straight through not wanting to put it down.  We learn so much in this book that explains what has transpired  in previous books.  Reading the series, I kept wanting Amy and Luc's story to take front and center, this story doesn't disappoint.  Ms. Evans hints at more to come and I can't wait."

This story is one that any mother can appreciate but it is a bit brutal.  I just love how she is developing herself and coming to terms with her life.  Her children are just awesome, so understanding and mature.  Cannot wait to see what happens next to this amazing character."

I felt like the author wrote her series just for me.  Even though the male characters with all their hotness would have probably kept me reading this book, it was the author&#8217;s brilliance that kept me captivated. The attention to detail was exceptional, I felt like I was on a journey with each of the characters mind, body and soul. This book pulls you in and won&#8217;t let go. There are a lot of powerful lessons in this book the balance of good and evil, choosing the right path and conquering all obstacles. This is a great series a book full of emotions, psychic abilities, passion and angst that will keep you wanting more.. Love this series&#8230; All I have to say is you have a Fan for Life&#8230; CongratulationsFive stars guaranteed, don&#8217;t hesitate just one click you will not be disappointed."
2012-11-3,B009Z643KS,5.0,Add this to your library,A3B3A0DBVLVWSN,"This is such a sweet book.  The stories and pictures are charming, fun and educational.  They are upbeat, positive and wonderful.  I found it to be everything you would want in a child's book.  Each story is well written but more importantly it is a story, the kind of tale that your child will ask you to repeat to them each year. And, your child will probably even have a favorite.  Add to this that the book has games and jokes and you have the perfect book!"
2013-02-23,B00A0NOF7G,5.0,This book was good enough to make me buy the next one,A1CZE84Z3882CS,"I enjoyed every moment reading this book.  Lexie gives you a twist and turn and some wonderment and the grannies are beginning to be really good sleuths via their ipads and internet.  It's hard to put these down.  Summer is coming.  Buy them all and read them by the pool or on the beach.  You won't be sorry....and NO, I don't know the author.  I'm putting this as a 5 star because I really liked the books."
2014-04-4,B00A0NOF7G,4.0,Very nice,AP0MMULH95T9W,I enjoyed this cozy mystery from beginning to end. Lexi and Jack make a nice couple.I recommend this book to everyone who enjoys a romantic mystery.

I've never been disappointed by one of Tim's books and Dead Seth was no different.  It's a highly emotional read.  He's created a character that is just so horrible, in Kathy Seth.  He's confused our senses with Jack Seth.  But most of all, Dead Seth, leaves me wondering what's next for Kiera Hudson?  What exactly does Tim have up his sleeve?  My guess is that none of his fans will see what's coming next, and we'll all be blown away by Dead Water.  I can't wait!"
2013-05-1,B00A1SR4QO,4.0,Handy reference book,A2IWR0FHJ2L3PH,"I received a free copy of this book in exchange for my honest opinion of it.  There is nothing new here for those writers who have researched on their own how to build a writer's online platform and promote themselves via social media.  However, what is incredibly helpful in this book is the day by day step by step instructions on exactly what to do and how to do it.  It's like being on a special diet where you don't have to think about what you'll be cooking for each meal, or even what ingredients are required -- the menu is provided.The author does hit the nail on the head for building a platform and marketing yourself on social media but never is it mentioned that some people are simply no good at marketing themselves no matter how well laid out and explained the plan is.I do hope that authors do not go into this blindly and without thought to their particular strengths and weaknesses.  There is no shame in not being a good marketer.  That's why writers write and marketers market.However, all that said, I still believe this is quite a worthwhile book for those who want to try or can do both."
2013-02-23,B00A2GQTIO,3.0,3 wonderful short stories,A24IGF4YDDLJZ9,This was actually a very good book. 3 nice length short stories. When a woman is fed up is a perfect title. I will recommend.
2013-03-30,B00A3YAQQQ,4.0,Great lists in this book,A6ABGNG7FILN5,"The information is good, but the lists are great. I was probably more pleased by those quick summary lists than anything else. My only complaint is that, like many books on this subject, zero information for prepping in areas prone to forest fires."
2012-11-14,B00A5XJE7M,5.0,yes!,AM2F0HV0U8IL7,Every book I read by this author just keeps getting better. I have read all of her books and I have enjoyed everyone. You will not go wrong reading this author. Thank you Susan for a great read.

2014-03-25,B00A6IF69Q,2.0,Up & down,A1G6KI79L72Z7B,I like this book very much but when I was at the end the book was too rich for my blood so it left me hanging not in a good way so no I would not rea ment it to any one ! I did like the first part ! But it sure was confusing at the end !
2013-02-28,B00A6RBHU4,4.0,Really good!!!,A3RZ8LFIVW35FZ,"Thank you to Xpresso Book tours (and the author) for providing an ecopy of this book...Cover: So unique!!! I love it!!!Title: Again, I simply love it... Especially I after I read what the word means...Allai:She was very easy to like... She was unlike any other heroines, she knows how to stand up for herself... She was not a damsel in distress waiting for her prince to come and save her... But of course there was a part where she got vulnerable because of the splintering of her spell... And she even had the guts to face Rhaize!!! In short, I really like her a lot...Drake:What I really like about him is that he always tells the truth to Allai... Even though he knows that it might hurt her, he will still say it... But he had a very sad past... I think this is the cause why he sounded way too mature for his age... It's like his mind is already centuries old but his body belongs to a teenager... I also feel sad for him because he lost his chance to feel safe and loved when he was a child... I really hate his father!!! He's the cause of all Drake's hardships in life...Story:I loved how Allai and Drake's love story unfold... They may have been separated for years but it's like they know that they will be together... Their love story was neither overwhelming nor lacking (is that the right term? Sorry!)... For me, it was just right, it might be fast paced but considering they knew each other from the past then the pace was fine...The only problem I had with the story was that I didn't feel any climax at all... There was not a time when my heart pounded because I was scared for the characters... Overall, the story was for me...And the epilogue!!! Grr!!! Why do epilogues have to be cliffhangers?!Can't wait for book two!!!"
2013-12-22,B00A7CFJAM,2.0,Good little short novella.,A2IFHFZ9YJBWCM,Predictable. Very little turbulence in the plot but both the mai players had lots of drama in their lives previous to meeting.  It should encourage single parents to keep hoping for a soul mate somewhere in the future.
2014-01-5,B00A850WT6,4.0,Easy peasy,A1LY6MKZ6KGBVD,"I loved this little book. I grabbed it yesterday whilst it was on free promotion and am pleased that I did.The recipes are extremely easy to follow... and aside from some of the ingredients not being available where I live (like the tins of enchilada sauce) I am looking forward to getting stuck in. That is the only reason I didn't give it 4 stars. Perhaps in a revision, they could consider putting in some basic spice mix recipes, and enchilada sauce mix recipes for those of us that don't have the great supermarkets that the US does. If they did that - I'd happily revise my review to 5 stars.It doesn't talk too much about spices - but that's ok... I'll just bang some in to my taste... as the book suggests.What I really did like, was that it contained quite a few recipes I hadn't stumbled across before.  This isn't a book about how to make fajitas, enchiladas and chili con carne - it's much more than that.I'd recommend it to people who like cooking the usual Mexican fayre at home... and are interested in adding a few more recipes to their repertoire."

I just felt that it was a little lacking,  everything went almost too smoothly in the book. The beginning and ending were great, it was the middle of the book where I felt that more development was needed. All in all I enjoyed the premise of the book, just felt it was lacking in delivery. If you are looking for a light, fluffy, quick read then this is the book for you."
2012-12-9,B00A9HW4KS,5.0,Useful Information and Practical Strategies,AQY890ZGY49VO,I was very pleased to discover the Metabolism Diet by D. T. Jiminez. After having little success with many different diets I have found the problem not to be the diet but my metabolism. This book provides not only the basics but a lot of well-researched information that is especially helpful to those of us in the over 40 age group. I found this book to be full of information as well is a good deal of helpful advice. I am convinced that this is the last diet book I will ever need.

Becoming a prostitute by using his magical abilities, he has amassed a sizable fortune, opened a successful brothel for those with eclectic tastes, and making a name for himself, but upon hearing that Anisa has married one of his most depraved clients, his heart tells him to save her from the mistake she has made, before it&#8217;s too late.Why should she trust him? Why should she believe him? What are her feelings towards him after he deserted her all those years ago? Will their romance be rekindled? What if she discovers what he has become?Dark Secrets by Shona Husk feels like an alternate world kind of read, steampunkish, with a touch of historical western romance. Her writing is tense, taut and brings forth a world where the talents and lives of her characters become completely viable and believable. If Shona Husk creates a villain, there is no doubt about it-that character is bad, through and through."
2013-04-5,B00AA3PA52,4.0,Fireworks Between the H/H Lead to a Fiery Romance,A2BRAUQW0M47DQ,"Take Me Home, Cowboy shows us that opposites do in fact attract as city girl Ally butts heads with rancher Matt from the moment they meet.  Ally's used to being the apple of her father's eye but Matt now holds a special spot in her father's heart as he admires his work ethic and ability to rebuild his life after a tragedy.Ally's initial reaction to Matt is one of suspicion that grows as she overhears many conflicting comments from him that bring out the worst in her.  She appears a bit elitist at first as she resents Matt's being so close to her father.  She's jealous and thinks he's out to hurt her father which soon proves false as a tragic accident has Matt coming to the rescue.  It's hard for her to get past the thoughts in her head which leads to a regrettable decision to run which is not at all thought out.  Her impulsiveness again shows her in a bad light and these fits of immaturity exasperated me.On the other hand Matt comes off as playful.  He's not offended by her snobbiness and gives just as good as he gets.  He's had a traumatic past that he doesn't want to rehash, he just wants to move on from it. He doesn't know why he's drawn to Ally, he just is.  They're very different people but something about the ranch brings them closer together as shows Ally in a much better light, it's a softer side not hardened by the big city.I never found their romance to be completely believable, but it is hot. Their verbal sparring leads to some very sexy interludes.  There's a fantasy feel to this story as it's a quick read with lots glossed over. The ending is especially quick and a bit over the top as yet another roadblock is put in the way of the HEA.  Ms. Ames has created a fun read full of fireworks that is every women's fantasy.  Here's to any future delights courtesy of Ms. Ames....."
2013-12-5,B00AA46Y06,5.0,Nice quick love story.,A2EJB1SYOTWK5V,It was a quick read but I did enjoyed it. Cute love story about a man who thought he was not good enough.

2013-09-11,B00AA4JIWC,2.0,so cliched,A1LSE3NINHIQI9,"There were only two decent books in this series, Ladle rat rotten hut, and Mary Mary quite contrary. But seeing as though he said the full series would not be like these two books I will not be purchasing them. And a FYI, Corvettes do NOT have back doors nor a back seat!"
2013-12-21,B00AA54AHO,5.0,Loved this series!!!,A30NWGP7BLGNSB,I am almost sad that I have finished this book because I am now done with the series. I highly recommend this series..it's a great read!
2012-12-27,B00AAODH6K,5.0,Going-home story found me in tears,A2MPVBXYAI4IQF,"In Angela S. Stone's novel, Boots on the Ground, two gay police officers from Canada are voluntarily serving in Afghanistan to help construct a civilian police force. The story begins when they become the only survivors of a horrific insurgent IED attack on the convoy in which they are traveling, near the end of the terms of their service.They end up together with a missing-in-action British nurse, Karen, in a labyrinth of caves, as the guests--or captives?--of ""friendly"" Afghans who are well aware they can't openly oppose the insurgents who control the area.So it's a torturous attempt by Karen, Ash, an Edmonton police officer, and Jason, a Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer stationed in New Brunswick, to go home. If only Ash and Jason can get their damaged cell phones to work again.And, to up the ante, Ash and Jason are married--but not to each other. Matthew, a nurse, is Ash's husband. David, a fellow RCMP officer, is Jason's.The story provides the reader with a great deal of the lives of Ash and Jason in Canada before they began their adventure together in Afghanistan. It also keeps us in touch with Matthew and David and all their families as Ash and Jason go from missing to presumed dead.Boots on the Ground brings to the reader's attention a matter I hadn't previously focused on. All the military and police authorities involved, as well as the families and friends of Ash and Jason and their husbands, make every effort to mislead the media into believing the two men are straight. If two openly gay men fell into the hands of the insurgents, they would be killed. In fact, Ash and Jason pass themselves off as straight men to the Afghans they live with because those ""friendly"" Afghans would also kill them if they thought they were gay.To say I became emotionally involved in this story is to state the obvious. Going home, Odysseus and Dorothy would no doubt agree, is one of the most heart-rending stories of them all. But getting home alive and well is no guarantee.And so, quite a few more times than once, this reader found himself in tears.Thank you, Angela, for this novel.(As first reviewed on Rainbow Book Reviews.

2013-09-9,B00AB1ZGX4,5.0,Another Winner from Tim Stevens,A265DSBRM4KWH9,"I read the first book, Ratcatcher, but couldn't download the second from the Cloud to read, so  I just substituted the Severance Kill, the third.  At first I was disappointed to find the protagonist was not the same as in the first book, but I got over it. Loved it, love spy novels.  How in heavens name do you have time to write and be a practicing physician too?! Whatever, just keep 'em comin', Tim. I recommend  this  book to all those who love action-filled spy novels."
2013-01-29,B00AB68SEI,3.0,Disappointing,A1E9B3KUDAU8MS,"I had high hopes for this book.  I liked that the subject matter was one not normally discussed in a romance novel so I was looking forward to seeing how the story progressed while Tae and Max were dealing with that roadblock.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed.It started off great.  I liked Tae, especially when she first met Max and convinced him to show her his deformed hand so that he wouldn't have to hide it from her anymore.  That was pretty awesome - it was also the highlight of the book.  It all went downhill from there. Because Max was able to finally show Tae his hand, that gave her the right to barge in on him while he was in the shower so she could see the rest of his injuries?  When they've only just met and HE'S HER BOSS??  Seriously?  Way too far over the top.  And then, the minute she does that, they are in love.  Give me a break.  I almost stopped reading at this point but was curious to see what happened next.Minor spoilers:  What happened next is that Tae, who was a housekeeper with no computer skills (couldn't even type) magically becomes Super Corporate Woman and fixes Max's business, when he couldn't.  She tells him the best way to proceed to correct a design flaw in a big project, she uncovers corporate espionage, overhauls his company's pay scales and improves the morale of 1000 employees.  All in a couple of weeks.  Yet she's too dumb to realize she might be pregnant.  Grrrrr.I will say that what I did like about it (and the only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 2) was that Max wasn't magically ""fixed"" in the end.  I appreciated the realism in that aspect but the rest of it was just crazy unbelievable.Proofreading and editing issues but not too overly distracting.  Adult language and explicit sexual content."
2013-04-13,B00ADEJ8WY,4.0,"Liked what was there, now I need the ending!",A3L96E35JI17VA,"Needs the other half! It stopped in the middle of the story. A tough topic that got me interested, then it was done. (Read the book that has both parts, so much better!)"
2013-01-26,B00ADSAWBQ,4.0,Fast entertaining read,A9O1T5I38I3CC,"This is a fun story.  It is set in modern times with a twist of fantasy, and is an enjoyable work from an up and coming author.  The beginning really captured my interest and there was enough action to maintain it.  The end does set itself up for a sequel.  It is on the shorter side, which makes it a fast read.  It's clean enough for a broad audience. I'm looking forward to seeing more of these characters."
2013-04-6,B00ADTIBRM,5.0,I have read this,A2AXZEFP334X86,it is a very fasinating book that I never knew about the Queen ....it is a good book to find out ...
2012-12-14,B00AEA847W,5.0,Really liked this story & will now read others in series,ALJO98LZGRC3P,"Descriptions were well done and as I have not read any other books of the series, this story seems to stand alone and makes me want to read about the other characters."
2013-01-13,B00AEDDPNC,4.0,Seductive Start,A19UT0OPQCDR8,"I've enjoyed other works from Lauren Jameson (under the name Lauren Hawkeye), so when I'm offered the opportunity to review new stories, I'm always game.Surrender to Temptation is a series of novellas, about Devon Reid. Devon is a woman who seems shy, reserved, and has self-esteem issues. That is certainly not helped when she discovers her boyfriend is cheating on her. When she learns this, Devon just leaves, escaping to a town she loved as a child. Almost immediately, Devon is approached by a gorgeous, mysterious, extremely forward man. After a strange, erotic encounter, she can't get him out of her mind. And he keeps turning up, turning her on, and giving cryptic mixed signals. When he becomes her boss, Devon and Zach take the employee/employer relationship to a whole new level.Okay, so I liked this. Devon was an ""Everywoman"", a girl many of us can relate to. She's not a bombshell, she doesn't have sexy comebacks, she's just real. I'm not sure how I feel about Zach yet. His hot-and-cold nature didn't exactly get me hot and bothered, but his sexual nature and the way he was able to rev Devon up certainly did.Overall, I'm intrigued and curious as to what happens in Part Two."
2013-04-12,B00AFCBFD4,4.0,Great read!,A3MQK86KI8IJN5,"In Rapture was a great read, I loved it!Malinda was an amazing and couragious character. To go through what she did, and then to be thrown into a situation that she could not deny, was heartbreaking. She knew that this was her destined path as a woman of Lena, so she took it all in stride and made the best it. I also felt bad for Grant, his past haunted him and made his present life miserable, but that all changes when Malinda come into his life.It's funny when two people, clearly in love with one another, fight their feelings because they're scared. Malinda and Grant where quite stubborn ,lol, but all with  good reason. I'm sure we can all agree when I say, It's definitely hard sometimes to get over the hurt of the past, but Grant takes it to the point where he clearly needs a slap in the head, lol.It wouldn't be a great story if it didn't have a little action and drama with a  HEA, and let's not forget about Grant's hotness,  but you'll have to read it to find out, lol.  I can't wait for the next one in this series!Enjoy!!"
2012-12-28,B00AFZ2JRM,4.0,Xmas Present,A11N6ZJPEMVHYJ,"A beautiful love story which develops out of a twenty-four year friendship.  What an awesome present for Christmas.  Best friends Libby and Tyler finally admit their feelings for each other, when Tyler comes home to visit a couple of days before Christmas.  All the pent-up sexual desire they feel toward each other  finally combust into one  long sexy ride."
2013-04-1,B00AGZEHYO,4.0,Good read,A2GXEDV0FZ4DBJ,Very interesting characters and plot.  Makes readers aware of the Delphi history and again the fight between good (Gnostic) and evil (Catholic church) going back centuries.  Very well written also.
2013-01-6,B00AGZEHYO,5.0,The Delphi Agenda,A3DQE82CEKZYTR,"A challenging mystery, fast paced page turner, and great characters. Comparisons are odious, but if you liked The DaVinci Code, The Delphi Agenda will satisfy you more. The historical references alone are an exciting education"
2014-02-14,B00AHE23SQ,4.0,Dry and a little confusing,ALNWM8DHMER32,"While this is a &#34;good&#34; story it is not a great story its only saving grace is its habbit of unexpected twists turns, and slightly erotic daliances between to two main characters."
2013-05-26,B00AHEW69M,3.0,Holiday Kisses,ABOQ30JIUNJIT,"Lots of short stories which is fine, but all of them were pretty much the same.  Lots of sex so if you don't like that don't read it.  A little too much for me and I'm not a prude."

2013-02-25,B00AHPRLV4,5.0,My 8 years old Son loved it,A257FUERMAZZCK,"Though the story is weaved around a girl, when I read this story to my son before he went to bed, he loved it. This is a good story with a clean, straightforward plot. The narration is really good and it creates curiosity and suspense.It is a good book. I highly recommend it"
2013-02-20,B00AI0LWMW,3.0,Issues unresolved; Needs another book,A25P93OL9EJWUT,"This is book 2 of Arcada. So, I had high expections for this book. The front cover isn't my favorite. I am disppointed in this book. The writing can be confusing and some of the details weren't clear enough for me. I hope there will be another book that continues on this same story line. If so, I might like this book more. Unlike Blacque/Bleu(book one) which can be read as stand alone, this book isn't, in my opinion. It introduces the main couple for this story and their background. It introduces the major issue that keeps them from being together, which is resolved. My issue is that the author brings up other issues that aren't resolved. I'll include them later on as a 'spoiler'. So, you have been warned.Travis is the younger brother of Lukas Blaque. They share same father, who is the alpha of the local pack. His father is the most dominate wolf in the pack. His mother is the local Omega. She is the 'weakest' werewolf in the pack and the other females tend to treat her like trash and walk all over her. She prefers to avoid confrontation. She is also their healer. Travis looks like his mother, not very masculine. He feels he takes after his mother not his father. He doesn't realize he is more dominate. He thinks he is one of the weakest werewolfs because of his mother and doesn't want people to walk over him.Travis is very self conscious about how people view him. He is attracted to both men and women, though he is denial about his attraction towards men. He feels that his pack will find him 'weak' because of it. He does not think he is maculine looking/dominate as his gay brother, Lukas. One night he goes out to the local hangout to drink and act a fool towards everyone. He is a bit childish. While he is there, he sees a very attractive man. He feels drawn to him, but is in denial about it. Travis ends up ticking off the wrong guys who decide to 'teach' him a lesson.Dylan, isn't human. He is bounded by a contract with a evil person. His contract is almost up though and he is happy because of it. His last person he needs to find and bring to his boss alive, is in Arcada. He has been trying for a while to find a way into Arcada. He is at the local hangout(right outside of Arcada) when he sets his eyes on a very attractive, fiesty, young werewolf. He feels drawn to him, though he trys to fight it. When Travis is in trouble, Acradia sends Dylan to the rescue.Dylan ends up taking Travis to his hotel room because there is to much snow. As they spend time together, they bond. Dylan is sad when Travis leaves to go home. When Travis meets yet more drama on the way home, Dylan risks his life to save Travis. By saving Travis's life, Dylan ends up in Arcada. Travis is very up front and decides to accept Dylan and lets everyone know about it. How far will Dylan go to keep his new love, Travis, safe. How far will Travis go to keep Dylan by his side?*KINDA SPOILER*  Rogue, crazy-in-the-head werewolves attack Travis and his brother on the way back to Arcada. Dylan, along with Travis's pack, end up coming in and saving them. Dylan is injuried badly and it takes weeks for him to recover. Even though, he is finally in Arcada, we don't focus to much on him finding his last target, but more on his bonding with Travis. They are meant for each other. They both fall in love with each other. The pack asks for Dylan's help with the three rogue werewolves they had brought back. Deacon is one of the rogue werewolves. With Dylan and Arcada's help, he gets more control over his mind and reality.They find out that Deacon's alpha hooked up with some demon who wants Arcada. It is this demon that is the reason they are all crazy in the head. Travis's 'uncle' James, who's gay, is best friends with his mother, Melody. When Melody walks in the room, where Deacon is held prisoner, James and him go at it. They were challenging each other over Melody, as a mate. Travis gets pissy towards Deacon also, because Deacon had attacked Melody. Melody and Deacon feel a somewhat attraction towards each other. Deacon believes that Melody is 'the one'.Dylan's hometown is like Arcada. He is able to talk to Arcada, very few have the ability too. As long as he stays in Arcada, he is safe from his Master/boss. If he forfeits his last hunt, he will be forever be bound to his Master. His Master was able to find his way into Dylan's hometown and he fears will do the same to Arcada. When he realizes what he plans to do with this last hunt, he forfeits and sarcrifice's himself. Dylan leaves town to confront his Master. His Master isn't to happy and orders Dylan to protect him no matter what. Dylan's Master teams up with the other demon(who wants Arcada) and sets a horrible fire that reaches Arcada.Travis, along with is friend(who is also the last hunt) leaves Arcada to save Dylan. They end up saving Dylan, but Travis almost dies. They end up killing Dylan's Master, setting him free. They all rush back to Arcada. With the help of Deacon, who happens to be a ER doctor, they end up saving Travis's life. The people of Arcada are able to put out the fire set by the other demon.Dylan and Travis can finally be together. Dylan who is a forest fae, who is also a guardian. As he and Travis travel around trying to bring the burnt forest back to life, he thinks of a way to bring his hometown to him. He ends up planting some seeds and tells Travis that once it grows back, he'll be able to travel back to his hometown to see his family, he lost so many years ago.So, here are my issues. First, what is going on with James? Why did he act as if Melody was his mate; he is gay, right? What happens between Melody and Deacon? What happened to the attack from the other demon? Did we defeat the other demon/villian? Are we still fighting against him/her? Where we able to save Deacon's alpha and pack? Where Dylan and Travis finally able to travel to Dylan's hometown? How much time has really passed in his hometown since he left, since time flows differnt there? His is family still alive?? If so, how does his family react to having a male werewolf has his mate? He was married with kids before. Plus, Dylan is the next heir of his hometown. Remember he has passed his line onto Travis also, so technically Travis is a Prince now too. Though, his fae kin might be a bit more understanding since Travis is part fae(remember we find out his grandfather was fae). Will Dylan's hometown expect him to still be the Prince? So many questions, no answers. I really hope she continues with this story, because I want answers! Please!!!If they were answered, I'd be a very happy and would give a higher rating to this book."
2014-04-22,B00AI8VLRA,3.0,Couldn't finish it.,A30PHXVJI5YZWA,"It starts out with a great premise that hooks the reader. But it bogs down with borrowing P.L. Travers character 'Mary Poppins&#34;. When the story line asserts that Mr. Banks, another Travers character, has been placed in a mental institution, I gave up. I've never been a fan of new writers riding on the shirt tails of established authors. It doesn't seem fair (or legal) to warp beloved characters in order to sell their work.Hayes can write well enough. She needs to stick with her own plots and characters and not borrow from others."
2013-12-21,B00AIAR4UG,4.0,"Comfortable, interesting read",A32NPQ4Z6ARXZL,"Mild humour, interesting story told first person.

One of those books that will entertain you and make you feel better for having read it."
2013-12-22,B00AK4SWUQ,4.0,For and a half stars,A1FEUV91GPIRSC,A sweet love story. I wanted to keep reading to find out how Brook and Travis would finally get together.
2013-01-18,B00AKNH28U,5.0,so so good,A2UQGX6YMQ5BAL,I am a huge fan of this author and this series had me coming back for every new book in it. I thought this book was an amazing addition to the original series where we find the couple still in love 10 years later but is everything as perfect as it seems on the surface? I would recommend to anyone this book but would advise that you read the series first because there are things that are revealed in the beginning of this book that will not make sense and will spoil the others. This book is so good though
2014-02-9,B00ALYQPRM,4.0,Good read.,A39529JJJEEDP5,"Not a professional writer, but the book is readable. Touching to read how a young woman (with a young family) deals with a potentially life-threatening disease. I admire her courage in signing up for the clinical trial and sticking to the terms, even though it meant undergoing chemo.  Frankly, I'm not sure I would have the guts!"

I am never disappointed, This book is a cross over between the Heist Society series and the Gallagher Girl Series. Our loving criminals work together with one of our young super spy to conquer evil.This really is an exceptional book and its free which is a bonus, so i recommend reading the book. you would love it. you may appreciate it more if you read the first two books of the heist society series.."
2013-01-15,B00AMU765K,4.0,Way too short....,A3PUXRP07EQCTB,The science was way off but all in all it was a fun read just way too short for my tastes.
2013-01-30,B00AN8ZPWW,5.0,You can't make this stuff up!,A2KJR14CE39W50,"Fascinating look at a truly dysfunctional trio of idiots whose actions resulted in murder.While it takes a while to develop the character profiles of all those involved , it is definitely worth it!If it weren't true, this would be the stuff of a freakish black comedy with tragic consequences.Well written, humerous at times, without downplaying the tragic results this has had on the survivors.I thoroughly loved it."
2013-03-31,B00AND5YIM,1.0,There goes my Sunday!,A64NGKLPWCG32,"Ahmm ....Do you know when your reading a book and you just wanna skip a few parts because you wanna solve a mystery or see a decision and can't wait for the suspense? ... well, her it is without the suspense, titled Marco's Redemption.Well that was a whirlwind of I don't know what ... I know i'm suppose to feel an emotion right now but I am truly and honestly blank -_- *crickets*Re-written and without all the omissions, this story had potential. As it is now, it's a draft. I am starting to wonder if my copy was an unfinished manuscript because no way that could be a story!The time span kept getting bigger to the end, there are sooooooo much unanswered questions and unfinished business that it's tilting my head. I can't wrap my mind around who Marco Donati is and all I can come up with is that he has serious mental and trust issues.Natalie is a case all by herself .... she tries to not be everything that she is, from naive to just plain silly!There is no depth at all, I got a tiny bit of information about Natalie and I know not a single memorable or intimate thing about Marco except for when he lost his virginity.The characters were not developed at all and to tell you the truth, I don't know if the story even had a climax, because it struck the same tone throughout. A grade schooler could submit this as a paper, minus the sex scenes.Event that also, held no steam at all ... didn't even get a damn nipple stiff! Like get something right!There were hints all over, but nothing was covered and every damn thing was left vague. I still have so many questions and wanna know so much more. I don't even know what he wanted redemption from and if he got it. Things happened so fast that I was surprised to see that I had reach the end, and had to be skipping back to see if maybe I accidentally missed out some pages.I have completed the book and still don't know what the hell happened in between the scene at the bank and the ending. I wanted to check the time to see if time froze or something, because this book made no sense whatsoever with regards to timelines, situations and decisions.And the messed up thing is, based on how the book began, I expected so much and thought that we would receive so much from it, but then they got together and it was s*** from there!Everything happened in a jumble with no explanation and before I know it *spoiler alert* she's married with  has four and a half kids ... like WTF tho! *end of spoiler alert*This was such a promising story, with a disappointing deliverance.There goes my Sunday!"

2013-10-10,B00ANFW7KS,5.0,very well put together,AEEUM7KZ70FEY,Very well put together.  Loved the passion and hummanity that our hero shared with the survivor's.  He gave hope. Shelter and something to live for. Not just to survive but to live. I hope I'd be on his crew. Boat people
2013-01-16,B00ANPDM16,5.0,Two thumbs up!,A1QOQJGKYAEMJ4,"This was such an amazing powerful and beautiful love story. Actually to tell the truth it was 3 beautiful love stories all wrapped into one moral of the story which is love can be hard and forgiveness is a must. I love the way Natalie left a journal for Lisa, gosh to have something like that to read over and over again just to know how proud my parents were of me, how I came about, everything about my life with my parents. it would be worth more than anything in this world. What a wonderful idea! The lessons and love put into the journal are breathtaking. I cannot speak more highly of Mrs Fostino's writing style and this book, completely amazing! :)"
2013-07-14,B00ANT5UY4,3.0,Could have been better...,A33UUSX8ECQTRQ,"WARNING: MINOR SPOILERSThis book seriously got on my nerves. How many ways can one screw up a relationship? Let us count the ways...1) Staying in a relationship with a someone who is not ""the right one"".2) Making assumptions about what others want and not asking.3) Not sharing your feelings or communicating in any way about said feelings.4) Running from your fears.5) Settling for less than because being with the right person is too hard.6) Not accepting that other peoples lives change and sometimes they have no choice in that matter.7) NOT COMMUNICATING...AGAIN!Oh the angst!Ok, so this was one giant bundle of mistakes. If Only is an apt title. It drove me insane. I know some people liked it but I just couldn't buy into it and I kept waiting for this angst to work itself out only to be frustrated again.Callie was so cute and sweet and I loved her. She had it all a hot motocross boyfriend and wonderful relationship and love. But she had no idea what ""love"" really was. Not until a fateful day when she crossed paths with Joe.Joe is a an enigma. He is a super-sweet good boy in a bad boy persona. Yes, he loves women. No, he doesn't want a relationship. But...if the right girl came along, maybe, just maybe he would change his mind. I wanted to like Joe. He was HOT and he was a tattoo artist. I just wanted to smack him upside the head.This book made me want to pull my hair out!I found myself skimming past seemingly unrelated and unimportant parts to got to the good parts. They were few and far between for me. I am so sorry to those of you who loved this book. It was just ok for me. There were LOTS of details that could have been skipped, they did not add to the story, only detracted from it. The lack of communication and naivete of both main characters made me feel like they were thirteen and not twenty-somethings.I got that they grew and grew up but still...come on.3 stars for me."

2013-07-9,B00AOP6V7C,4.0,Destiny of Coins,A12K5Y2SEANYW0,"The Judas chronicles once again scores, with all the previous stories having set a high bar, this one doesn`t disappoint. Keeping the action and suspense at a really good pace can`t be easy, but, as you will see it can be done."
2012-12-22,B00AOT0UIE,5.0,4.5 stars.  Such a wonderful holiday romance; however.............,AUL7MG79RGZTK,"This was a really great holiday romance, like really great!  I'm not going to sum it up because the book description does a really good job with that.  I absolutely loved this couple (sucker for a man in uniform, even a former one), and the story flowed so well!  It was 90 something pages; however, it didn't feel like a short story.  It should have been a 5 star book, truly, but once again, Ms. Burke dropped the ball at the end.Please note that I am a big fan of this author - I have 12 of her books in my collection; however, she is quickly becoming the John Grisham of interracial romance novels for me:--(.  To explain, I am a HUGE fan of John Grisham and will read anything he writes; however, his endings are a bit of a letdown for me.  The same can be said of the recent stories that I have read by this author,  however, unlike the perdurable loyalty I have for Grisham (because I don't really expect to go away with a warm, fuzzy feeling after reading a legal thriller anyway), the same cannot be said in this case.  I am tired of having great romance stories ruined by a not so great ending.  Yes, it's important to give the couple their HEA, but it's just as important to tie up lose ends.  Please don't make something an important part of the story if you have no intentions of concluding it.  Seriously, just don't start it if you're not going to bring it to conclusion because it just irks me to no end to be left hanging.I  would definitely recommend this story because it is a great holiday romance.  However, since I think the ending is just as important as the beginning and because this  author has let me down a few too many times, my collection may stop at 12."
2013-11-25,B00AOT3UDG,4.0,hot!,AR6EJGTUWR24B,I read the 2nd book first and this one was just as hot! I was a little confused at the beginning between Rickie and Erica and who they were. The book was still a sizzling intro into the BDSM world.
2013-11-1,B00AOU0D1C,3.0,Sexy and fun,A3OHH7RZJ5N1KF,"Could have been longer. I love Liliana Hart, I just wish this story had had a bit more development of the characters or more interaction both in the bedroom and outside.It's not her best work, but it's a good addition to the collection if you like her romance stories."
2012-12-19,B00AP1OS8E,5.0,An Incredible Sequel,A15IF7NAB1Y196,"After finishing the first book in two days, I was waiting for this sequel for what seemed like years (really only a few months).  Then I got Book Two and despite trying to ration myself, I still finished it in three days.  Bruce and Mike are back, and badder than ever.  I won't give any spoilers but the action in the first half of the book was mindblowing, while the second half was a little slower as the clan was busy with other projects and concerns.  Some of the secondary characters, Stephanie for instance, get more of a chance to shine in this book and we get to learn more about them.  Bruce, as in the first book, is still a larger-than-life character and we get more details about his days as a Ranger as well as find out more about ""the wave"".  Hopefully, Book Three is already in the works."
2014-03-5,B00APJOTLC,5.0,Addicted to this series,A8KRPQFQPLZKI,"Very cute, cozy mystery. Nothing too stressful, light easy read. If you have read the whole series, it makes sense how excited Summer is about being married, but it was a little weird anyway. But overall, way worth the time!"
2013-09-4,B00APOA59W,4.0,Bit Shorter Than the First Two Idiot Review Books,AIO247KHD2O40,"I got this one in a trilogy collection calledThe Complete Idiot Reviews (A Laugh Out Loud Comedy Box Set)so it came together with the books Village Idiot Reviews and Office Idiot Reviews. That may well be a cheaper way for you to obtain the first three books too rather than buying them individually.  This Idiot Government Reviews start at 70% of that Kindle book so it is a little bit shorter than the first two.  Although it still had its moments, I wouldn't say it was a good as the first two either nor as memorable.  Possibly as it was a little predictable due to the character traits, and there weren't as many characters (or reviewers of products) as in the other books. The fact it's about politicians also means it's a bit limited to where it can go humour wise too I guess.  But as I said it has its moments, like a politician who got caught drying himself down below with a hairdryer by the paparazzi, or the paper airplane attack by one who has a seat in parliament outside of the camera's eye.  The book is written as a series of reviews by the different characters of actual products here on Amazon that they've bought to help them through the day, to embarrass their enemies or with their political ambitions."

Is one's of those books that you can easily read over and over and enjoy it each time as you seem to catch something different in it when you reread it.  It's one of my top ten favorite series.

2014-03-3,B00AT4NPTA,4.0,Entertaining and well-written,A160QNRWBEXKDM,"This is an elegantly written romance, complete with a damaged heroine and a man who is not all he seems to be.Melanie Grey is not only physically scarred, she is also fleeing the nightmares of her recent past, which is why this lady of noble birth dons a disguise of sorts and takes the position of housekeeper at Gavington, a property in Northumberland.Adam, Lord Jarrow, master of Gavington, is a broody sort, still apparently struggling with grief after the death of his wife six years previously. At least that is the excuse for his continued isolation on his country estate, but as Melanie gets to know her new master she has reason to believe he may have other reasons for shunning company.With an engaging cast of characters and a fun &#8211; if somewhat predictable &#8211; plot, Dark Whiskey Road is an easy, entertaining read. Good dialogue, well-crafted prose and a good eye for those historical details that give the reader the illusion of being elsewhere, combine into making this a book I can definitely recommend!"

2013-05-10,B00AVQKI96,5.0,"Her place in time, a true warriors time.  A keeper",AJKQE92ZKWBAO,"After reading the wonderful reviews I decided it was time to check this author & story out.  I was not disappointed at all.  I spent most of the day reading this which is unusual for a book of this length, I couldn't put it down.The story goes like this briefly:  A specially trained operative on the run in modern day U.S.A. takes a chance to escape our world to time-travel to an long ago era of her family's ancestral origins.  While unsure what she would find, she keeps to her code taught to her & she does find acceptance, love & so much more.  In this place she fits in as a woman warrior (think valkrye) around 9th century Vikings & she thrives. There were not many times a woman like that would be accepted ""as is"" in the entire history of our planet.  It really sets this story apart and I loved it!  Adventure, humor, mystery, beauty and romance are the basics but told in such depth you will feel as if you are there experiencing it with her or even with others.  It is that good.I encourage anyone to read this who wants more from the historical/action romances ""smut"" that is not commonly written today which is more sex than story. There is so much more to life & this book has it!  Sure there is romance but it's only apart of this epic tale.  This novel stands apart & is a shining example of an excellent novel & is also well written.  It is worth the money!  I would have paid more if I was familiar with the author.  The h/h are amazing characters with many sub characters you will like as well. I'm so pleased that I'm heading straight to the next one to read.  Great job Miss Jackson, keep writing as you do & keep them coming.  You are very talented."
2013-03-13,B00AVRUKM0,3.0,"Review: The Eslites, by CM Doporto",A1AR6ZVHOTLVK5,"There was an interesting concept to this story. Though, I think that it's a concept better fleshed out in a longer piece. I'm a fan of short stories, but I feel that this one was in need of a little world building at the very least.While reading questions continued to pop into my head about just what kind of events lead to this alien race coming into control in the way they did. Also, the use of the term ""state of the art"" occurred often, but there was nothing to base that off of. This was obviously a futuristic story, but what is state of the art when it comes to a world that's already going to be state of the art to the reader of today?I also had questions arise near the end (which I won't get into due to them spoiling things). The characters knew more than I did as a reader, and I think that it limited my understanding of why some themes were brought up in the end.All in all, with me still having questions and also zipping right through this one, I think I'll be looking forward to book 2, ""The Coming,"" when it is released."

2014-02-6,B00AX1ZBKU,3.0,Cute story.,A3IQ0P3M39IY8U,"It was a really cute story, just too short. Because it was really short, there wasn't enough time to build any real character development. I am happy though that the author did give us a short epilogue at the end, rather than just giving us a abrupt ending like most short stories tend to do. And it was written very well, too.All in all; I still think this was worth the read. I know I would still recommend it to everyone."

2014-01-5,B00AXN813M,5.0,Dystopia is the Opposite of Utopia: Memory of Mankind is Fragile,A3TE5OTAQOXS65,"When I was asked to read & review this book, my first impulse was to make sure I was clear about what the term, ""dystopia"" refers to. (quote) ""A dystopia is the opposite of a utopia. It appears in many artistic works, particularly in stories set in the future. They are often characterized by dehumanization, totalitarian governments...or other characteristics associated with a cataclysmic decline in society."" (end of quote)- Wikipedia""Electronic Gags"" by Kudakwashe Muzira fits the above definition perfectly. It is set in a totalitarian USA governed by a military dictator. The protagonist is a biologist named Freddie, who is a rebel. He is the only person to safely get away from a police raid on a secret rebel meeting. Michael, his best friend, is put on death row. Freddie will try to save his friend and his country.With this plot, you will be reminded of Orwell's 1984. In the real world, you will be reminded of Mandela's fight against apartheid in South Africa, King's struggle for civil rights in the USA, and Ghandi's nonviolent resistance in India, which led to its independence from England.Suffice it to say that the memory of mankind is fragile. Consequently, there will always be a place for books such as this one, which helps mankind to remember past mistakes, and hopefully, avoid repeating them. If this book helps us to do that, then it is a fitting tribute to the memory of Mandela, King and Ghandi. Highly recommended.Reviewed by Thomas Jerome BakerAuthor ofHow to Coach A Debate Team*****Many thanks to the author for providing me with a digital copy of this book in exchange for a fair and unbiased review.*****"

I noticed several incorrect statements here, possible just because of the choice of wording, but still...among others,Lincoln was not the 1856 Republican Vice Presidential candidate, nor the only president with a beard, and slaves in the Union were not already free when Lincoln freed those in slave states through the Emancipation Proclamation."
2013-03-25,B00B0FSH9A,3.0,Paranormal twist to Bible stories to form a unique new tale,A1RN75YVR2O8MQ,"3.5 starsThe Mark of Abel takes some of the stories from the bible and puts a paranormal twist to it. It is told from two Pov's, and we spend most of the time in the present day and visit some of the memories of the past.Luke has been driven by a prophecy and Janie, the artist may be that link. Only she doesn't know this other world exists and that her dreams are something more. Together they face not only the dangers in their lives, but their inner demons as well.Luke I really loved..... Even though he is the real Lucifer, he is just misunderstood. One passage I really enjoyed was when he said this -""`Guess what. I'm really Lucifer, the Bright Star of the Morning. The Devil. Forget what you've heard about me. It's all bad PR. I really should get someone to handle it better, but whatever he says is going to be twisted, so why bother?'""He has obviously been around for a long time and he lost his faith in God way back in the beginning, but he is not the baddie we were taught to believe. He is loyal and sweet and often puts those who are important to him on a pedestal, he really is an awesome guy... and yummy too!!I found it hard to relate to Janie, I am no artist and when I look at art and paintings, I really don't understand it. What I did understand is the passion that she has - we just have different passions. However, her art comes from the nightmares that she has constantly had since the deaths of her parents and they flow onto the canvas.I enjoyed the twist of the bible in this story and how the author was able to turn the stories that I learnt growing up to form her own story. In TMOA we briefly meet a lot of characters from the bible but together their stories are different to what we all know. What I did hope for between these characters was more of a romance... they definitely have spark, and some great swoon moments that hinted for more, but it didn't cross over into the bedroom at all. Overall, it was a good book and if you enjoy books with that biblical theme you will find it highly entertaining.I received a copy of the book from the author in exchange for an honest review."

2014-01-19,B00B0QX1HW,1.0,The Amazon Metrics tracking technique is out of date and cannot be implemented...makes book useless,A3OSH5NGRQ4LHV,"While the gist of the book is positive, it does re-hash information available in numerous other books of this style. That is to be expected.The specific technique (and why I bought the  book) that the book describes relies on is tracking Amazon analytics for the authors books by inserting a Picture with a Tracking link into their books description page. Amazon has defeated that ability, so the baseline metric cannot be established, rendering the book useless. The Author should either update it or pull it."

Still hate Thane's Mum and Pamela.4.5 Stars maybe. Once again I was swept away into catlin's world and all things British.  As with the last book there was humor, adventure, mystery, interesting ghost but this time around the Author successfully added  quite a few new elements that took me on a wonerfully exciting thrill ride that I hated to see come to an end.  The Exodus scene had me choked up with tears and heart breakingly sweet emotions.  I love Little Colin.  I could just picture his cute little face and adorable chubby little cheeks and fingers!  AH! How Sweet!  I personally did not find the plot farfetched but rather a very feasible situation especially given the social differences between Thane and Caitlin's worlds.**POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT**The villians were as evil as usual and thank goodness at least one or two of them got their just reward. But there are some people for whom even Hell is simply just too good :)I thoroughly enjoyed this book and highly recommend it.  It can be read alone but I recommend one reading :""For Sale Old Manor (Free Ghost Included) first for a complete appreciation of Thane and Caitlin's world.  BRAVO Ms. James!"

2013-02-17,B00B3NF6CK,5.0,Clint and Edward's quest continues... with a slight change in focus.,AUX9KZUUB3YCE,"""Unicorn Western 2"" is the second book in an old-west serial by authors Sean Platt and Johnny B. Truant. This Kindle e-book was a 274 Kb download (approx. 98 printed pages) and sold for $2.99 at the time of writing this review.SpoilersThis gunslinger/western parody continues as it follow Realm Marshal, Clint and his faithful white unicorn, Edward (well 'faithful' might be a tad of an exaggeration... how about cynical, sarcastic, ornery, stubborn and all-round general pain in the ass), as they tract down Zord and Cerberus (a black unicorn) across the Sprawl with its ever shifting and magical sands.Their primary quest is interrupted by a couple of events involving some bandits, a Sand Dragon and some unexpected help along the way.End SpoilersSome thoughts on ""Unicorn Western 2""...1.) well written... prose that made sense and was easy to read.2.) the tale had a great sense of pace and timing.3.) the intriguing character development of Clint and Edward continues from book I.4.) lots of interesting (and often inane) conversational bantering between our unusual pair of heroes.5.) several 'action' scenes... with a great confrontation at the end.Impression:Although I really enjoyed this old fashioned western parody with all the images that a cowboy (excuse me, Realm marshal) and his horse (excuse me again, his unicorn) can muster, I did however perceive a slight change in focus in this work compared to book I. I felt that this book seem to have a more 'serious' tone to it. Let me explain...It had a few areas where our 'boys' had moments of quiet reflection and personal contemplation as they pondered their raison d'tre.And while it still had areas that were humorous, it seemed to lack those numerous special moments that had me chuckling to myself (when I wasn't laughing out loud)... something that seemed to occur with more regularity in the first book.That being said... this is still a great tale, well told. There is a definitive professional feel to the quality of story-telling that shines through from the first to last page.And despite my minor concern regarding the humor aspect of this book, it is still 5 StarsRay Nicholsonraynicholsonsreviews@hotmail.com"
2013-06-26,B00B54TZA6,3.0,Fun but a bit lacking,A2CC8FRA0J2GXE,"The Roots of Evil - the fourth in the Doctor Who 50th anniversary short stories, penned by Philip Reeve (another author I've read before but not been wowed by) - turned out to be a rather nice little story.The plot was serviceable, and Leela as the companion fit well into this particular tale, set in a huge tree as it was, and the Doctor was recognisable and the story felt fitting for Four. So in that sense, everything was fine, but somehow the story still felt a little ... not sure how to put it, but lacking something? The conclusion came too quickly and easily, perhaps. Again, this is a complaint I often have with short stories, but even in this medium (and in this series) I've read stories that have felt more balanced."
2013-04-4,B00B56PA4Y,5.0,hot,A3UPJ010UBVTA0,Even that this SEAL's On Fire series is every book from a different author I loved it and was going to buy every one of them. I was fortunate enough that I got them (all but one) for free. Loving it!!!
2014-04-10,B00B5IBCYO,4.0,Fighting Darkness,A1PRHUGQ68K9PQ,"The first thing I would say about this book is that it reads like a fairytale told to children. There is a narrator who occasionally makes comments and is also good at giving definitions and explanations where needed. The second thing is that while this is written somewhat like a fairytale, it is most definitely not for children. The evil is concrete whether it is being perpetrated by humans or extraterrestrial beings. In places it is downright gruesome.The story is about Gavin who, through no true fault of his own and along with his much beloved young wife, is brutally assaulted and then murdered by a group of thugs who he was unfortunate enough to have to work with.At the same time we have Saul, a very powerful demon. Saul was so powerful he took on Lucifer in a bid to be number one. Didn't work out well for him and he ended up trapped in a warehouse located on hallowed ground. So he's looking for a surrogate. Which leads him to Gavin. We now have a demon who wants out of his prison and one very unhappy soul who wants vengeance. It's a match made in...well certainly not heaven.To fight this darkness is Clara and a tapestry which her family has kept for generations. There have been stories about the importance of it but nothing has ever come of them. Until now. As Saul and Gavin begin their deadly games Clara is informed that the time has come for the fulfillment of the tapestry's purpose. The purpose? To save the world from darkness and utter destruction. Clara is understandably a bit overwhelmed. With her friend, Seb, she will travel her preordained path in terror, awe, anger, and a determination to set things right.This was a good story. It was a bit slow in places but it's made up for through the originality of the tale and a few surprising twists I never saw coming- which is fairly rare for me anymore. The ending made me think that there may be a sequel. If it happens there is no doubt that I will be ready and waiting to see what comes next."
2013-03-25,B00B5XDXPA,4.0,A great book if you enjoy plot twists and romance.,A23W4VL6UFPJ0N,This book gives loads of detail and background information into the reason behind why the characters are as close as they are. It felt too short. I would have loved to see as much detail in the conclusion of the book as there was in the beginning. That is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. It definitely held my attention and kept me wanting to read more. I would recommend this book to anyone that enjoyed reading romance novels.
2014-06-7,B00B60R6W8,4.0,Fun read,A1J5GKR4AX31BP,A well paced fun read with quirky characters and some laugh out loud moments. A fun light hearted book for a lunch hour or beach read.

2013-05-4,B00B69WHAK,5.0,yummy cop and bondage too,A14ZFBCT64HYPT,"Forbidden Fires is book #3 in the Bondage & Breakfast series by Jodie Griffin, it is written as a stand alone story so it can be read as such but I always recommend reading them in order(just my OCD talking)In Forbidden Fires we get a love story with BDSM elements and we also get the suspense of a good mystery while we are at it in a moderate sized book. The characters come at the plot in a unique was the heroine is a police officer, not someone you would think of as a submissive and the Hero doesn't realize he has Dom tendencies. The first time Delia and Colin were involved it was hot but they weren't together long enough for Delia to reveal her desire to be a sub now she is drawn back into a case with Colin and it has a BDSM connection.I enjoyed the heroine being almost an alpha dom in her job and a natural sub in her relationship with Colin, I loved Colin he was so turned on and so bemused by it. I thought the mystery/suspense part of the book was well done and that the sex scenes were HOT. We don't get deep into the BDSM scene its an aspect of the over all love story and mystery but it isn't dark or intense as both are beginners to the ""scene"".I received this book in exchange for my honest review."

Her soups sound great and I am surely going to try a few as I think Mediterranean is some of the healthiest cooking there is. Oh...and something else, what is ""double cream""?

I cannot begin to tell you how disappointed I am in this book. It is like reading a short story in a magazine. I honestly thought I was getting more than 59 pages. This is a huge disappointment from a wonderful author. Will I read the next book by her? I am not sure. I understand that you get what you pay for but I don't even feel that I got what I didn't pay for. The woman is not very bright, has she ever heard of putting her phone in rice to dry it out? If the two people working with her were as computer savvy as she says they should have known that also. And she runs a business? Hmmm I do not recommend this book to any one."

Not the case here with Lori King's 3rd book in this series. It is a fresh and different story. Still dealing with hot werewolves, Rafe and Ryley Whetstone are brothers that work as firefighters. They get the wake up call of their lives as they go to a Kindergarten class to talk about fire safety. They meet their mate, Shandi Martin.Shandi is not looking for anything serious, after a bout with cancer that left her barren and without a boyfriend. But these hot werewolves wouldn't take no for an answer. They  continue to pursue her, trying to be patient. When out of the blue she knows that she really is their mate.Love where this story takes us, the characters are not perfect. They cannot just all meet and live happily ever after. Getting everything they ever wanted handed to them. They are faced with the inability to have children, parents and a sister that reappear in their lives. Lori King is a wonderful author! She makes you see and feel through the characters. And luckily there are many more hot werewolves in the Gray Pack so we can continue reading!"

2013-04-6,B00BF41BLW,5.0,Loving Jenna Series,A39N24TTLP6I48,"The hero in the Loving Jenna Series is one hot young executive in a financial management company owned by his family. Morgan is driven to succeed in the eyes of his father and that is his big personality flaw. He has never made time for a personal life with a woman and then he meets Jenna. She could care less about his position or money, which he quickly realizes and this starts the steamy hot romance with lots of ups and down but always plenty of hot steamy sex for these two to make up this four part series.  Add a wicked ex-girl friend, Morgan's parents to add twists to the story that is an emotional roller coaster for these two mismatched lovers. Will they each get this relationship together for a happily ever after ending ~ I am not telling; you will have to read the series to find out.The author supplied me with a copy of this manuscript with no request for a review. This is my honest opinion of the series."
2013-02-23,B00BFFZCHU,5.0,Safety Measures During a Pandemic,A3GSSX9XHONVCD,"The author presents a vast amount of valuable information, including a historic overview of epidemics and pandemics (global outbreaks of a serious infectious disease), time lines relative to another global issue, and practical steps to take if and when confronted. Personally not a fan of shots and inoculations, I lean more toward a healthy immune system and the aromatic essential oils and herbs that have worked historically during epidemics. But even if you are of a holistic mind set, this book is highly recommended for the practical steps we can each take to guard ourselves from catching and spreading diseases."

2013-09-9,B00BH0VTQG,4.0,Slow summer burn,A17BTP1QHK2I3I,"This book, last in the 'Star Harbour' series brought back some of the characters from 'Blaze of Winter' in this Cape Cod town.  Theo Grayson is collecting a writing award, and his family are thrilled. Cameron Stahl, who runs a boutique here and another in Boston, comes to the ceremony.  She can't relax, thinking of her demanding schedule.  Val Grayson, Theo's brother, spots her alone and persuades her to dance; life should have some fun in it.Val goes back to his own demanding DEA job, which tracks drug shipments. A trail leads to Star Harbour at present, and someone with funds is shipping large amounts of chemical drugs through the quiet town. Congressman Kirkland, prominent at the writers' awards, is suspect.  Cameron keeps shuttling between her two shops, changing seasonal inventory and preparing for summer. She's making money, but she has no time left for a relationship. Then she runs into Val again and life suddenly holds possibilities.I liked Cameron, a trust fund girl weary of charity suppers, restrictive family and society chatter, who wants to make her own mark. Val is something of an enigma, an isolating career having left its imprint on his character. The wealthy Cameron seems out of his reach. There's a clam beach party, boat fishing and other activities fill the summer, along with a sizzling adult love affair. A pirate treasure legend has been strung out through the series as well as drug shipping.  Cameron and Val's relationship falters, as she realises that he could just be using her to get to the Congressman.The last of four books wraps up the ends and Star Harbour fans will enjoy it."
2013-02-25,B00BH1SMA6,5.0,Exhibitionism at it's best! Are you ready to love in public? I am now!,A343UV3RLU8J3S,"I am adventurous, but I've never been ""love in public"" brave. This book has a really interesting hook that we have all wondered about. What is it like to hook up in public? There are some very hot scenes between Emma and Paul her incredibly hot man (I imagine a Ryan Gosling/Bradley Cooper/Channing Tatum hybrid....wow). The characters are great in this book and are the real reason to read it. Jessie and Zach are another favorite couple. This is a unique book, with a main part, a short story at the end and a little interview too. What a tease! If you like hot stories with real characters, this is well worth your quiet time."
2013-02-21,B00BH8U9DM,4.0,An Interesting Environmental-Post Apocalypse Story,A1U3LIALASYOLZ,"I&#8217;d give this book 3.5 stars, but since that is not an option and it is better than a &#34;ok&#34; read, I am pushing it up to four stars.This was an &#34;odd&#34; read for me for two reasons, the first is because I really did not enjoy the reading of  it much, yet somehow became driven to finish it. I put it down a couple of times thinking I would not pick it back up and just move on to another book, But I found myself picking it up again until I decided to push through to the end. It just would not leave my mind.The other reason that this was an odd read for me was that I loved the characters, but disliked  the world of the story. A dust land full of dust and dust and dust.. yeah that is redundant isn&#8217;t it. There was a lack of variety in this story&#8217;s settings. To me, it felt like I was watching a two setting stage play. First this room (stage), fade black. Light second stage, Fade to black. Repeat.  My mind was crying out for depth and variation.Yet the characters were well written, rich and full of complexity. It is the characters&#8217; stories; their emotions, their motivation and hardships that makes this book.The theme of this story is bleak. The overall tone of it is depressing, to the point that I&#8217;d call it a tragedy.It is the same message as many of the environmental apocalyptic stories out there, but it is the telling of this one that stays with you.Judging from the ending, I would assume that there is a sequel and oddly enough if there is, I would read it.Do I recommend this book? Yes, but I&#8217;m not promising a five star read, just an interesting read that keeps the reader wondering.NOTE: There were parts in this story that had graphic violence. Due to that I would not recommend this to readers under the age of 17, but I am a bit conservative on my views on violence."
2014-05-23,B00BHMO5U6,5.0,A Calming Read,A281NPSIMI1C2R,It is probably unrealistic to imagine that your life will always be stress free. However it is realistic to expect that there are things you can do to take a break from the stress of daily life. This book is filled with stress-relieving techniques. There are simple ideas like doing breathing exercises that can help you destress anywhere. Some ideas also help to create less stress. Like the idea of being nice to people as much as you can so you create less negative emotions. I'm sure that this book will help you find quite a few things to do when you feel stressed out. Maybe you need to take a day for yourself and go to the spa. Sometimes we have to be reminded to take care of ourselves. I found reading this book to be a calming experience all on its own. Highly Recommended!~The Rebecca Review

2013-02-23,B00BI4IY3M,4.0,To Know Her by Renee Burke,A1A2UUBPN2AMTO,"For a debut work, I thought Renee Burke did a fantastic job with To Know Her. I got this as a Kindle freebie and as with freebies, they're either a hit or miss for me. To Know Her was hands down a hit for me.The story opens with Sara hitchhiking on the side of the road at night with no form of memory whatsoever. She doesn't recall how she ended up there; she doesn't even know her own name. Luckily, Sara is saved by Derek who takes her to his home to care for her. Being cared by Derek and being in his home gives her a sense of comfort and familiarity, yet Derek is nothing but a mere stranger to her.While reading, I had a knowing sense of what was going on, yet I didn't and I believe that's what made this read so interesting and a page-turner.  There was a little pinch of suspense/mystery laced into the story that had me questioning a few things and curious to find out what happened to Sara and who was Derek, this man who conveniently appeared out of nowhere in the middle of the night to rescue Sara.To answer the questions posed in my head, I eagerly read on to uncover the whole truth and I have to admit, it was quite surprising, but pretty brilliant. I really liked the little twist at the end and how the story wasn't so predictable where I knew exactly what happened.Overall, I am impressed. To Know Her was more than I expected and I am glad I took a chance on this little gem. This novella packed in a whole lot; I got a whole story out of 17,000 words (69 pages) and was not in the least disappointed. Sara and Derek's story was sensually erotic, romantic, emotional, and thoroughly satisfying.I highly recommend To Know Her for fans who like romance with a not-so-typical plot, a sexy & dominant hero and love scenes that not only make your heart race, but your toes curl. But, seriously those love scenes were fog-up-your-ereader-and-set-off-your-fire-alarm-hot! ;)Simply put, I highly enjoyed To Know Her and am excitingly looking forward to Renee Burke's next story."

2013-03-6,B00BMKOPGM,4.0,Steamy story... with icing on top!,A17WDSX47ZHRFD,"""This city better watch out, because the new cupcake queen has just been crowned.""With a lot of determination and talent, Liv is ready to start her own adventure. And with the help of a mentor and a lot of cash, Liv's dream of owning a bakery is finally coming to fruition. After working her way successfully through the ranks of her mentor's bakery and being a part-time bartender, Liv is ready to branch out on her own. The pressure is on to make her sweet treats the best, but with supportive friends surrounding her, Liv is ready for the challenge. What Liv hadn't anticipated was to get involved in a different kind of venture altogether - a more personal one. Just as her business is about to open its doors, the man of her dreams steps in and refuses to let her hesitancy sway him. He's everything Liv never thought she was missing in her life and for the first time ever she is contemplating letting another man into her heart. And just when Liv thought she was safe to give in to that temptation, the sweet smell of personal and professional success quickly turns sour. Now she must decide if any of it is worth picking up the pieces.""For the love of all cupcakes, please don't let this man take my heart.""Jake is on the hunt for a prestigious promotion and nothing and no one is going to get in his way, but he didn't count on a sweet smelling slip of a woman to be his downfall. If only she wasn't the ""mission"" his boss wanted him to complete in order to land the job, then falling into bed with her wouldn't be a problem. Just when Jake thinks things can't get anymore complicated, the ""spark"" his grandfather told him about is exactly what he finds with Liv. The woman of his dreams just couldn't have come into his life at a worse time or under worse circumstances. The more Jake gets to know Liv, the worse the temptation becomes to give in to the chemistry between them, but the lies are mounting. Now Jake has to figure out a way of how to have his cake and eat it too before it's too late.Deception, sex, cupcakes, and chemistry - quite an intriguing combination and wow did it work for this story! Between the underlying saboteur plotline, the effects of a deadbeat dad, a misunderstood womanizer, and getting all hot and bothered by Jake and Liv's sexually charged encounters, the pages just seem to fly while reading. Add in a humorous group of friends and many delicious references to cupcakes with a naughty tip on how to use frosting for things other than just eating it and you have the recipe for a fantastic read!It was refreshing to read a male lead that is sweet and romantic instead overbearing and extremely alpha, which seems to be all the craze these days. This is not to say Jake's character isn't instinctive in both protection and possession of Liv and he takes care to prove it throughout the story. And I liked that the lust wasn't immediately acted upon, so the buildup was that much more for when it finally happened. Both characters are likable and possess a depth that is nicely drawn out in the story. The road to Jake and Liv's HEA is definitely not a cakewalk, but neither is it as confrontational as I would have expected. A couple events left me wanting a bit more after all was revealed. It just seemed to be that the people involved got off a little too easy. Aside from that, I thoroughly enjoyed getting to know the two main characters and their eccentric friends and wouldn't mind stories on them.In the mood for a scrumptious read with just A Taste of Trouble? Then this one's for you! But beware you may experience a craving for cupcakes (among other things) while enjoying this story."
2013-07-11,B00BMM5M3A,5.0,Worth the Wait!!!,A2P32KZF47D5S4,"I had pre-ordered this book months ago and I must say that it was definitely worth the wait.  I love the characters that Elle Kennedy creates.I really loved this book.  If you've read any of previous reviews you may know that I enjoy erotic romance and one of those reasons is because I starting reading Elle Kennedy's books.  This book has such a great plot with believable characters that I found myself invested in immediately.  My heart broke for Claire, Dylan, and Aidan at different times throughout the book, and had me cheering for them at others.This is book 9 in the Out of Uniform series.  I have read all of the previous books so I was aware of the back-story between these two/three characters.  You would not necessarily need to read the previous books to enjoy this one but if you like erotic romance and menage stories I would suggest picking them up as they are great reads.  Ms. Kennedy writes fabulous sex scenes with great menage where each character is included and you don't feel like one person is always left out.  This is not a contemporary romance, this is a contemporary erotic romance.  That means that there is graphic language, explicit sexual situations such as man on man and menage-a-trios with so much heat you may need to turn up the air conditioner...you've been warned!!**A full review will be on delightedreader.com soon**"
2013-03-20,B00BMRTDPS,5.0,Another big score from a consistent author,A1J1S9E53DNAP6,"If you're new to Ponzo, I'm extremely envious as you are about to embark on some of the best writing you'll find in the independent author scene.  All his books make my top ten authors list and this one is no exception.  Fast paced, carefully crafted and wonderfully written, the book was a ""can't put down"" for me and, unfortunately, I polished it off in one day.Please take my advice, even though you don't know me, buy all the books in the series and start with the first one and feast upon a series that never lets us and doesn't stop entertaining.  Very easy books to get lost in and isn't that what reading fiction is all about!"

2013-05-1,B00BOTU4AW,5.0,"Making me crazy, in a good way!",A3FY5T0A2VBU40,"What can I say? Mimi has done it again with this Novella. It is a fun read and gives a glimpse (maybe) of the excitement and turmoil coming to our favorite Deities and their loves. I liked the fact that we were given some history on Chaam and why he became evil. I really hope Mimi's next book is coming soon because between Chaam, Cimil, Zac and Nick I am going ""bat s*** crazy""!"
2014-01-1,B00BOVL2CE,4.0,NOT FOR EVERYONE,AB5F6705JT7US,"I had been sitting and talking with Kallypso Masters over dinner when she came out to the area that I lived...her, myself and one other person who was able to make it to meet her were all talking about the kind of books we liked and what exactly we love about them. Everyone has their own taste in books and what they enjoy. I do not judge people by what they like although if I can find something that we both agree is good I can get lost for hours talking about books. I made comment about Kally's book with Damian and how there is a breath play scene that was just plain hot beyond all belief and there wasn't even any sex. We spent some time talking about that and I told her and the other woman that I love a good dark read. I personally love capture fantasy, rape play as well as breath play. For me Edge play is just great reading as far as I am concerned. I got a message from Kally telling me about this series. She had told me she didn't know many books that have capture fantasy in them but when she found out about this one she wanted to share. I was excited but all I was able to do at the time was add it to my to read list.I was finally able to read it when the awesome author sent me a message and asked if I would be interested to read the first book in her series, she is in a book group I am in as well and saw that I was looking for capture fantasy reads. I jumped on that and said absolutely.Before I get into the book I will start by saying that what bothers me more than anything else is reading reviews of books by people who do nothing but complain &#34;I don't know why anyone would want that to happen to them, I don't know why any woman would ever agree to get into that type of relationship, It is abuse, It is wrong, blah blah blah...&#34; If you are reading this story it is hard to understand HOW you wouldn't know what you were getting into. I mean COME ON there is a warning at the end of the synopsis! Why be completely disgusted when you know what was coming for the most part? Don't search out these types of books if they are not for you...That being said in case you are not aware... THIS BOOK MAY NOT BE FOR EVERYONE...THERE ARE THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN THIS BOOK THAT NOT EVERYONE WILL ENJOY READING.Warning: Capture fantasy; dubious consent; anal play; M/f as well as one m/f/f/m scene; BDSM themes including caning, spanking, bondage, and needle play. Also contains one beginner Dom who is exploring sadism but is still working out how and when to stop.About this book...overall I did enjoy it. I wasn't so sure there at the beginning though. I was trying to figure out what was going on. There was this idea Jodie has that she could make money on doing a documentary on the whole capture fantasy that so many women have. Klaus (an ex of hers) agrees reluctantly because he doesn't want her to find some random person to do it and possibly hurt her. There is an agreement and a contract, a list of rules and what not as well. And don't get me wrong, I completely understand that this is something that has to be determined beforehand (safe, sane & consentual) but for me at first I was kind of wondering if I was going to enjoy this read because it all seemed a little &#34;too&#34; planned out.I don't want to give away anything because well I hate spoilers but I will say that when they get to the house that she has set up with a 'prison' in the basement for herself, she walks in and says okay. He then locks her in and walks away. I mean I instantly had thought &#34;Well that isn't much of a capture if she just walked in willingly and didn't even pretend to fight like she was actually being captured.&#34; I wouldn't say I had lost interest in the story but it was starting to drift down the road of disappointment at that point. Because I was expecting something all together different.Now, don't let that disappoint you. I had a friend that did read it tell me they didn't like that it was all planned out a little too much. I honestly believe for it to work out well you have to 1) trust the person 2) have your boundaries (limits) 3) TRUST THE PERSON. Well things change... at about 20% into the story things take a turn and I have to say that I was instantly drawn in and wanted to know more, wanted to know what was going to happen and how things would play out from there on.One of the things I did enjoy VERY much was reading a book about a guy who has never done any BDSM but is willing to try to help out a girl he used to date and still cares about but things just didn't work out for them in the past. It is the FIRST book I have read that is about a guy doing any form of BDSM for the FIRST time. Everything he is doing he has seen online and the one thing that I was instantly drawn to is how it affected him. To read about a man doing things that in his mind, are wrong, not okay and not 'normal' yet it did things to him. Made him feel things that in his mind he knew should be wrong but he wanted more. She is another, she has never submitted to anyone. It's something they are learning together. Learning they enjoy it a little more than maybe they ever thought they would?!&#34;Did every man have some version of a monster inside him, deep down? Maybe we just needed the right circumstances to set it loose?&#34;&#34;Odd, how the mind changes. The perverse and kinky becomes acceptable. An insult became a compliment...&#34;In most books I have read it is the submissive that is learning for the first time that it is something they want and need. They also end up with a man who is an experienced Dominant. So this was something different to read and overall it was a good read. It does lean a little more on the S&M; side. I can say that I used to not understand the draw to it but after reading a few books that explained it well, I understood why a submissive would desire pain. I got a few things here and there on why the Dominant men needed to give pain. This one, it doesn't really explain why he desires it so much, it is more along the lines of learning for the first time how enjoyable an orgasm is. He is learning that he likes things that he never would have thought he would and all he wants to do now is sit and 'play' with this new found desire.I can honestly say that I was not completely sold on the capture part of it so much because that to me was a bit lacking in that area. It felt more like an agreement between two people to try out BDSM for a specific amount of time and there is no ending it until that time was up. She didn't have a safeword... that was one of the things that made me think, okay now if you were in fact captured you wouldn't have one now would you? So there were a couple things that did have that captured feel to it. The dark side of this story was mostly in part to the thoughts that are going through his head. There are a few things that some people may find disturbing. I personally did not. It is the first that I have read that did have any kind of needle play. I would love to believe that if I wanted to have my husband try some stuff he could be that good that fast for the first time but when it comes down to it I read for the fiction not the reality! :) Everyone has to start somewhere, some people are 'self taught' and I have to say the internet is wonders for research, then there is Fetlife. Which you got to be careful with in reality because it is pretty much fb for the kink world. Some are on there to lurk, some to learn, some to teach, others can be predators. So be safe on there!I did enjoy the back and forth from the point of views I will say that I have become a fan of first person writing. I enjoyed reading their parts, in all reality I kind of wish it was all in Klaus' point of view. I think for me his mind was much more interesting. I liked seeing how he thought and how those darker thoughts would take over. BUT that might be because I am just one of those people who is a fan of the dark.Just know that this book may not be for everyone but if you are a fan of BDSM it might be something you would enjoy. Everyone likes something different so some will love, like, and not like it. Either way... Happy Reading!"

Online sources do not allow users that luxury.  Call me old fashioned, uncool, or whatever.Thus far I'm easily able to navigate the ""paper"".  Time will tell if I keep it or trash it."
2013-09-3,B00BPDVUVE,2.0,kattywatty,AJ3K2B0EF1Z9B,I  thought this book started out good and was interesting. The breadmaking seemed a little far fetched to me. I realize it was fiction but really some of this could not have happened. While living with the Indians it is amazing that French girl and her brothers being in the village is never explored. Then to have her husbands foot eaten off by a wolf. Sure. I did not enjoy this book. Wish i hadn't spent the money.
2013-08-31,B00BPFAUCW,4.0,Nice book for parents and their little kids,A1QLXCFG9YCKHD,"This is a nice book for parents of little kids, to read for their children and teach them about zoo animals. I think this book is little too long for one time reading since a young child may get tired quickly (but maybe I'm wrong); anyway you may read it in two sittings if that happen. As for me, the small images are too small especially if using a smaller reader.But in general, you may learn a lot about zoo animals from this book."

This book has everything book number one did with the added bonus of comedy as well. I found myself laughing out loud quite a few times. It stays true to the series in ending with a bang so to speak leaving me wanting more i can't wait to read on.
2013-09-20,B00BTMGBD8,5.0,loved it,A1TVHK78XYVNMV,So I totally loved this book. Jess and Conner have a rocky and not normal beginning. But slowly you see how their feelings change with them not even knowing it. Then they each discover it at different times and when something happens and they almost Lise each you wonder if they'll get their HEA. Love the epilogue. And there's plenty if Hott steamy scenes but mist of all a good story line to keep you interested

2013-05-29,B00BWUCOEC,3.0,Interesting but disappointing,A35V7DCEGLF13F,"I really liked the first book in this series, and went ahead and bought the last two in order to finish the series. I was so disappointed. Sam starts out as this interesting girl, and dissolves into this spoiled, self-centered, downright cruel individual. She claimed to love Elliot, but clearly has no idea of what loving someone ""for better or for worse"" entails. I actively disliked her in the second book, and was more than ready to be done with her by the end of the third book.Read the first in the series and choose your own ending."

2013-09-22,B00C0NTHOK,3.0,short story better served as preface,AU58Q4M7NCYC9,"This story should have been a preface Zero Recall (to second book in legend of Zero series).  Maybe it could have stood alone as a teaser or short story addition to anthology.  But as a stand alone publication it is a bit short, particularly for a publisher whop claims to be less profit oriented.The author indicates you should read this story before Zero Recall.  Perhaps, but without the background from at least Forging Zero, you will find the race interactions difficult.  With the Huolt such an obvious backstabbing murdering not to be trusted race, it would seem odd the rest of the sentient races have not risen up in mass to exterminate or at least control their immoral nature.  Even the Darhel appear straight forward trustworthy  and Jret a bit naive comparatively.This story should be offered for free as a sampler, or as a preface to Zero Recall.  It is an OK read; but adds little that can't be extracted from more elaborate book, unless you just wanted to engulf yourself in this alliance of alien misfits again."

2013-04-1,B00C1NCOOE,3.0,Pretty good,A1OBQ5I31GW1TG,I have loved the first three Dartmouth books but this one wasn't what I expected. It confused me on some parts but I didn't like where it switched to Mason and Aikira. That part could have been a part of another book. Overall I liked it. I like where she wants to put her daughter first but didn't like were she took off and then expected them to just forgive her. She should have talked to him to find out how he felt.

The plot was a little predictable, but there were enough fresh ideas to keep me interested. I liked that the love scenes were a part of the story but didn't drive the plot. So many fantasy romances are too heavy on the sex and too light the plot these days. Good read."

2013-04-18,B00C3OR51S,3.0,does it work,A29NDGCCMTU8ID,"Boy everyone gave it 1 star or 5. So I decided to give it 3. It is true that it is definately trying to get you to buy thier cleanse. The question is does  it work. I am considering a cleanse. if I do go with this one, I will let everyone know the results. There is a great book onFun Fitness."
2013-04-3,B00C4LH3QC,4.0,Something new....I liked it,A3R6GY8PI7QK4O,"This was a totally different read from Brenda. I liked this new angle she took. The whole secret surrogate with a three way storyline was such a catchy idea. The usual heat was brought in the sex scenes which is a Brenda Stokes Lee trademark, and by heat i mean five alarm fire!!  Everything else that was happening made this story work well also. I do wish though that the book was a longer. It did end a bit abruptly, I was waiting for more to happen at the end and when it didn't i was left wanting more. Other than that this read was great and I'll continue to support this author in the future."

Imagine that- actually well-written, interesting erotic short stories... I very much enjoyed the collection and finished it in one day. Nicolette Grey has quite a talent for weaving a storyline with twists and turn that you may not expect. I very much look forward to reading more of her work."

2013-09-30,B00C51HA6E,3.0,Sweet & Romantic,A12ZO1K8ZVRBR5,"*Actual Rating: 3.5 Stars*Inspire was a sweet, romantic story of young love and a summer romance to last a lifetime. It was a quick, easy read and the plot flowed really well. The characters were likable and I quite enjoyed reading it.Paige is on her way to college in the fall so her parents decide to drag her to the mountains of Vermont for a summer RV trip. She is less than thrilled to spend her summer away from her friends and in the middle of nowhere. However, her first day there she meets Travis, the son of the campground owners, and there is an instant connection. The more time they spend getting to know eachother, the harder they fall. However, there's a secret hanging between them and when it comes out it may be impossible to get over.I liked Paige and the fact that she wasn't a spoiled rich girl, which she had the potential to be. She was very charitable and not judgemental at all. Even though Travis was from money like she was, it isn't evident by looking at him and she never thought twice about getting to know or fall for him. She was so trusting and maybe a little nave. Even though the other girls at the camp shunned her at first, she was still kind to them and helped them when they needed her.Travis is down to earth, sweet and seems like a total package. He comes from money like Paige, but you would never know by his attitude and his hard work ethic. He went through a rebel stage and is all tattooed up so he is definitely the type to be judged even though he shouldn't be. I really liked Travis and I could tell his feelings for Paige were real and genuine. That is what made his betrayal so much harder to take. I never expected this from Travis and I was honestly surprised.I actually really enjoyed the plot of Inspire and the way the story flowed smoothly. It was a light fun read about young romance and I was able to get into it easily. Travis and Paige definitely had chemistry and I really liked them together. However, Travis wanted to keep it a secret and at first it didn't seem like a big deal since some of the girls were less than friendly with Paige. However, as the girls softened to Paige and became friendly with her, it was clear that Travis was hiding something because he didn't want to go public with Paige. When the truth came out, my heart broke for Paige. She was so in love with Travis and she felt betrayed. I was definitely disappointed in Travis myself but in the end he did prove himself to Paige and me as well.While I really enjoyed this book and it was easy to get into and read, I did have a few issues. I am not a big fan of insta-love and this book definitely had it. Travis and Paige were saying ""I love you"" and declaring love for each other after 2 dates and that was way too fast for me. While they spent a lot of time getting to know each other and connecting in those few days, they still moved way too quickly in my opinion. Also, I thought that the quick turnaround of the other girls in camp was a little unrealistic. One minute they are being snotty bitches to Paige and the next minute they are spilling their secrets to her like best friends. I felt like it would take a little more time to change their attitudes. Despite these small issues, I really enjoyed Inspire and I look forward to reading Britney's story in Forgiveness."

2013-09-24,B00C5R83E6,5.0,SWOON,A15UM8VEAVV13U,"This story was much needed for me, I needed Ellie & Adams story, I loved the flashbacks & the build up to their romantic past & present. My heart ached for them both, but poor Adam, he fought with all his might & Ellie was a firecracker & well we all know how that went. I thought this book was brilliant in the fact she brings their past up through journals & it was hilarious at all the ways Adam tried to keep the boys away from Ellie when she was younger. I swear if these two didn't get together I was going to boycott Down London Road (which is in my top 5 favorite books ever)! This book was deep & filled with such passion & love for two lovers who fought for years to keep a certain CarMichael happy... If you haven't read this series you need to bc these books do not disappoint!!!"

So I get the whole cheating and what Trista had to do after her affair blew up on her was pretty bad but the author prepares you for that in the description so there should not be any surprises. I did not think it detracted from the story and loved the setting in Greece and also how Bass and Emma were back in this story. Hot book with a good storyline and even some surprises in the end that I did not see coming!

2013-08-15,B00C8FEKAG,3.0,FOUND IT JUST OK.,A2Y99DSQKKJNZH,"You couldn't help but like the character Florrie. However, I found it to be just another book of ""upperclass"" male falling for a ""lowerclass"" female. I found myself getting bored with it throughout the book. Then, towards the end, I found it was rushed and seemed ""The End"" appeared out of nowhere."
2014-03-28,B00C93JVJC,5.0,Great book for children,A1Z4KFRO5IC39N,A great book! My 4 year old son loved the pictures and to learn about the animals. We went to the zoo and he was so excited because he knew stuff about the animals! I strongly recommend it.

From start to finish, the book had me captured and I was unable to put the book down.  This is the first of many books from the author (I'm sure) and I plan to read all that she creates.  Now,  please hurry and release part 2. TBRS all day everyday!!!"

2013-07-16,B00CABSAZE,5.0,Very well done little book,A1NN0E08YMIC6V,"I picked this up after finishing the first book in the Family Blood Ties series, where I met the main characters.  After getting a little intro to Taz and Sian in that book, I jumped at the chance to read a little more indepth about their struggle to be together.  This was a terrific short story and I hope to see more by this author."
2013-06-30,B00CAE0TUU,4.0,Sweet Romance,A1WAOH99I78LBD,"This romance was a sweet, clean romance. The love between the H and h was realistic in the way it grew between them.Casey is injured towards the beginning and has to work her way back to being able to function on her own, and it is during this time that Tres begins to fall in love with her. I think that it is interesting that when she's all curvy and her hair is long and shiny, Tres feels lust for her and a tiny bit of affection, but when her hair has been shaved off due to her accident, and she no longer can walk, plus her other disabilities, that is when he realizes he is falling in love with Casey.This is a story of how love can rise above all barriers, physical or financial. There is no wall so high or mountain so steep, that TRUE love can not scale it.As said prior, this is a clean romance, with fade-to-black love scenes, as well as, no cheating."

His baby mama was a hot ass mess and stayed with the drama, and lets not forget the baby mama's cousin. This was a first read by the author and I'm not opposed to reading other works by her; however, they have to be more than just ratchet stories."
2013-04-13,B00CC2KLM6,5.0,great book,A68ITSVWBLCZT,Well worth the wait!!!! Get this one quick you won't be able to put it down.  Now I really can't wait for the next one!!!
2013-06-1,B00CC6X8HC,5.0,...she's a hurricane!!!!,AL4D6OHMS2Z9P,"I so love books told in first person...and I especially loved reading this story from two POV.  The male/female POV.  Superb!  I SO loved Valentina (Tina) Tomic's character.  How can you not?!?  She's so genuine....so human!  She's kind hearted, honest and selfless; she's ""down-to-earth"".  REAL.  The stuff that spews out of her mouth, without forethought, is delightfully delicious...which only makes her more endearing.  She's perfectly lovable.  She's a free spirited butterfly who is full of trust and love.  There is no facade with Tina.  No hidden agenda.  She's simply and innocently friendly.  And she's also dealing with wounds from a profound loss.  Deep inside she's very damaged.Tina, 26.. owns her own Clothing Boutique in NY, right across the street from Nikolai Leokov's Night Club.  She see's him come outside everyday, three times a day, for a smoke.  Watching him get's her curiosity churning...Nikolai Leokov is a 34 year old owner of a Night Club.  He's a handsome, but very private man, who's devoted to his family.  He doesn't ""do"" relationships, but rather prefers bed buddies, and moves on.  No ties.  Nik doesn't give his trust easily...his experience with money hungry women is high.  So when Tina comes into his life, he's naturally skeptical, and stand-offish - - but Tina is genuine.  She's all that she appears to be; friendly and open...and when she realizes that Nik is suspicious of her motives (she chuckles to herself)...when she understands that he thinks she's ""after him"", she quickly clears things up by suggesting they be friends.  Only friends.  Nothing more.  ...game on!I absolutely loved this story of false assumptions, romance, and a little bit of mysterious intrigue.  Small bits of Organized Crime added more flavor.  I thought this Author did a fabulous job of delivering a commanding, romantic plot with lot's of humorous moments and dialogue.  I thought the narrative and dialogue was nicely balanced.  I loved the impromptu words that shoot out of Tina's mouth at any given moment.  She's absolutely, delectably hilarious.I adored the sub-characters and their devotion to each other.  Ghost, Max, Trick, Nat, Mimi, Lola...all such great personalities.  This author does a suburb job with character description and reinforces it throughout the book.  The plot never unravels or disintegrates.  The story kept me captivated and laughing throughout.  I loved that Tina was Nik's saving grace, and he was hers.Yes, there were a few misplaced and misspelled words.  Who cares?  It's nothing that anyone with any sense can't figure out.  This is this Authors' first book and I'm sure it wasn't picked up by any major Publishing House which simply means this Author published her own work.  That being said, editing software is hard to come by for first timers.  Hence, mistakes.  And who cares if the Author isn't from the U.S?  Hat's off to you Belle Aurora!  Great Job!  I'm really gonna have a struggle waiting for more of your work, but you can bet I'll be watching!"
2013-05-23,B00CCH4WKI,4.0,it was alright,A1U3D071GFHC5M,I will say it was ok but there really wasn't a story line to go with it. Its just a hot guy and a spoiled princess I would say.
2013-05-28,B00CCH4YMO,4.0,"Oh, where do I begin?",A203USUVG6OMV9,Well most comments say that the book repeats its self but honestly it was quite good. The curse words bothered me but I just overlooked or tried to overlook them. I would recommend this book to people ages 16 and up personally. Over all this book was pretty good.
2013-12-23,B00CCRTFSC,2.0,"Sorry, just not my thing.",A3IQ0P3M39IY8U,"I should have known better by reading the synopsis. But after seeing some of the high rating it got, I thought why not give it a try. I started reading the first few chapters and right away I knew I had made a mistake. But I'm not the kind of person that gives up easily, so I continued to read on.  I just hoped the story would get better, but if anything, it just got worse.WARNING TO ALL THOSE UNSUSPECTING PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL ON THE FENCE.....This story involves human trafficking and a little bit in female slavery."
2013-05-10,B00CDGPTIM,5.0,A wonderful book that should cheer all young at heart,A1J5DFZMRYYHSM,"The concept of this story is attractive. Welcome to the world of Phinn, an angel who guards young good souls to heaven. Yet it was not just the imaginative story I liked. The story also flows seamlessly and the characters are all appealing in their own way - yes, even the evil Iszn. The story of angels and demons is covered in an ingenious and imaginative manner, which I thoroughly enjoyed.I believe the message at the heart of this imaginative story is to have faith in the good things, and that this faith or belief will eventually eliminate despair and darkness in one's heart. Not a bad message, and one that should appeal to all ages. Thank you Mr. Anjakos for introducing me to the world of Phinn. I look forward to the next one in the series."
2013-04-23,B00CE4A8UM,5.0,Wow Great addition to the series!!!,A12HFSYQZRND51,Evangeline Anderson writes with such passion.  You can actually see the characters in your mind as you read.  The interaction between Victor and Taylor was hot.  Such an alpha male with a gentle heart. I would recommend this book.  It can be read alone but is better if you read Crimson Heat first. I can't wait to see where she takes us next.  Keep up the good work Evangeline :)
2013-04-17,B00CE4A8UM,5.0,Wow!,A3J6YK7HK16TJC,"I don't know how she does it. The first book in this series, Crimson Debt was released about a month ago. I'm amazed that Evangeline Anderson can produce such a wonderful piece of work in such a short time. Scarlet Heat is even better than Crimson Debt. Taylor and Victor matched and balanced each other so well. I think Evangeline did a really good job of exploring and tastefully discussing Taylor's past abuse. Victor is possibly one if my favorite heroes. He was so patient, loving, kind and understanding with Taylor. I love how Taylor grew throughout the book and turned into a confidant, beautiful person. As always the chemistry and sex is off the charts hot. Evangeline has a way of writing amazingly erotic sex scenes. I appreciate that the sex scenes add to the storyline and not just thrown in there for the hell of it. Rather, every sex scene has a clear purpose and helps to build the love and connection growing between Victor and Taylor throughout the book. I would highly recommend this book to anyone. It's at a bargain price and just a wonderful read. I also recommend reading the first book in the series as well. Please check out the rest if this author's work. You won't regret it!"
2013-04-24,B00CEHHWW6,5.0,4.5 stars of paranormal hotness!,A35CFYF3M6VKH6,"Reviewer: BexRating: 4.5 out of 5 FairiesDianna Hardy's second installment in her fabulous 'Eye of the Storm' series has grown in action and character development. Whilst I really enjoyed book one, Releasing the Wolf, Cry Of The Wolf has taken this series to a whole new level.The main characters have been crafted and developed in a fascinating and gripping way, with the plot offering creative twists and fast paced action. Even before we get to the hotness of the characters and the steamy scenes, Cry of the Wolf already hits the fabulous 4.5 rating with the strong narrative and intriguing character interaction.The author, Dianna Hardy, has certainly advanced the depth of her characters creating a werewolf series that is certainly becoming a favourite werewolf series of mine.If you've yet to read book one, Releasing the Wolf, be sure to devour it before you get to book two. An impressive series filled with heat that will have you melting, characters that will have you swooning and a storyline that will keep you gripped.Disclosure: This book was provided to Bex 'n' Books in exchange for an HONEST and not necessarily positive review."
2013-12-3,B00CF6317Q,4.0,Bold and breathtaking,A1UNGBJPTXRF4P,"I was offered a free eBook in exchange for an honest review.Keith makes some bold moves in his debut novel. The action begins right away as Keiko discovers a hidden world behind a tori gate in Tokyo. I liked Keiko right away, and the mystery she discovers pulled me into the book. It seems Keiko's entire life has been hidden away from her, a life entwined with Spirits who rule the elements and multiple worlds.I had some issues with some scenes later in the book. There is a lot of fighting scenes between Greater Spirits, and some of it I had difficulty picturing. This is not to say that Keith is a poor writer. I found the writing quality excellent throughout the book. But there were times I needed a little more grounding in details. A lot of the fighting takes place in the air, and it became problematic for me trying to picture things. There were also quite a few flashbacks and seeing scenes through other character's minds, which confused me now and again.But overall I enjoyed this book. I loved the Japanese flavor to it and the Japanese mythology. Even better, Keith isn't afraid to use Japanese words and phrases, which I was happy to say I understood! (I've been taking a little Japanese since my partner is of this heritage.) With a large cast of characters it was inevitable that some were better drawn than others. I liked Keiko and Yui best, which makes sense as they are really the most central characters. The concept of Greater Spirits and Guardians was an interesting one, and I found this a refreshing change from most of the other fantasy out there.I hope to see more from this writer."
2013-08-21,B00CFLVMA4,5.0,I am Sally,A1JPLGB0JXDY7S,"Review: I don&#8217;t have many words for this short story due to it making me speechless.Not many things of writing can do that. I can cry more about a piece of writing than not have words to describe the feelings that the piece did to me.I want to say I was shocked, but that feeling cannot fully describe the drawn in the wreck of the mental mind of Sally that the author painted.For so little words of this piece, I got a large picture of Sally&#8217;s life with this man, Bailey. I could feel why Sally thought to do what she did.Most people keep things inside until they cannot take the pressure of the buildup and then they let it lose. I am one of these people and I saw myself in Sally.5 StarsAuthor Website: e: [...]"
2013-07-15,B00CFM59IO,5.0,I want more,A389P88WEI7VA5,I'm so happy I just read this today and two is coming out tomorrow. This book pulled me in from the beginning and I was done with it in two hours that how good it was and I can't wait to see  what is going to become of frog and sienna
2013-05-30,B00CH1FO1U,5.0,Loved it!,A3GOZ65KMBUI13,short read but very cool plot....I would recommend to anyone on the fence about their purchase of this book. reasonable price and it was worth it
2014-02-24,B00CI3WCEO,4.0,Craved more!,A2XNOB1T796Y6B,"I got this the same time I purchased The Witching House, so when I was finished with it I was able to fill my craving for all things related to the Blood Coven. However I do give this warning: read this short story first. While I think that you could probably pick up more insights from reading this afterwards, I liked that I didn't know who/what the killer was and was left with this feeling of anxiety and expectation for the book itself.This is a fairly short story, as about a good 10 pages were the typical &#34;after&#34; fare: author bio and book preview. The shortness of this worked in its favor, though, as I don't think the urgency of the story would have worked as well if we'd had a longer look at everything or at the characters as a whole. I think it would have also somewhat detracted from the book itself, as part of what makes this piece and the book work as a whole is that they throw you directly into the story ala Night of the Demons.Definitely worth reading if you're a fan of 70s or 80s horror films."
2013-10-25,B00CIA6S56,3.0,Cute,A2NDDUWL5RSWUY,"This was a cute book. I would recommend it to the kids, especially around Halloween.I hope you enjoy this cute book about zombies."

I love her character, and she was portrayed perfectly in this book.Rand has now lost all his loved ones to vampires... first his parents, followed by his brother, and now his wife and daughter. It's easy to see why he's a vampire hunter. After his house his engulfed in flames, he leaves for Switzerland to join the Brotherhood of the Blade, an elite vampire hunting group. Hopefully they will help him avenge his family...."
2014-03-1,B00CIY33KU,4.0,very good story about the power of forgiveness,A2NMCWDXFV0XHJ,"I really loved this book. It did need a bit of editing, and the style is really simple. If I could have given it 4.5 stars, I probably would have.  It was super easy reading, yet it stirred much thought about forgiveness and some about faith, too. The lead character was good, but she needed something more written to make us love her more, I thought.I also loved that there was no profanity or sex in it. I read a lot of Christian Fiction for that reason alone... Still, sometimes even supposedly Christian writers DO include that stuff. This writer was squeaky clean, and I loved that!!! I will probably read other books by her.I loved her transition in her thoughts about the leading man! I think this is what the power of love (especially, good Christian love) can do in our lives."
2014-03-30,B00CJGUHR4,4.0,Well written characters with wonderful banter and incredible sexual tension!,A3LBGLSO2VDJ9Y,"This book totally caught me off guard. The leading characters have a wonderful verbal banter and off the charts sexual tension.It begins with Jennifer Kent and her best friend Lisa moving to the big city of New York to make it big.

2013-09-17,B00CJPYF8W,5.0,A rating...,A23GRXCXQU3SM8,"My Review:When I started this book I wasn't sure I was going to like it. It starts out with Gia and three of her friends in a set-up that is pure cheesiness with their little Girlz club and this guide to life they've written (while it provides the framework for Gia to do what she does, it felt a little too much like a junior high level club among bff's...ugh). I'm telling you right now, ignore that aspect of this book and you will love this book because the romance side of it is so good.Gia has had a crush on one a guy who works at the same company as her. They don't work in the same department and he has no clue who she is. She's tired of being the one in her group of friends who never has a good sex story...or ANY sex story as the case may be since it's been forever since she hooked up. The rumor is that Luke is leaving the company, but he has a corporate meeting in Vegas coming up so she and her girlfriends plot to put her in his path that weekend. Gia truly just wants a super-hot sex and fantasy filled weekend with her fantasy guy, knowing that he's about to move away. Donning a complete new style featuring colored contacts, extensions, hair dye and makeup and clothes that she normally never wears (by day, this girl is a computer geek), she heads out to Vegas to seduce. It works...too well.This book is so hot and so sexy...and in the end, the romance is so sweet. I fell in love! Here's just a tiny snippet so you can see how sexy this book is:Luke's temperature spiked.Horny as hell.""Actually, my fantasy is of a sexual nature,"" she told him, a flash of nerves in her big brown eyes before her gaze locked on his mouth.The nerves, as much as the fact that her stare was like a caress over his lips, were a major turn-on.""You don't say. Is this a fantasy you'd like to share?""""Maybe. With the right guy.""""What's it take to qualify?"" Whatever it was, he'd do it.""Imagination, boldness and the ability to follow directions top the list,"" she said. Then, as if testing the strength of the passion between them, she shifted closer so her full breasts brushed his chest. ""What do you think? Are you up for the job?""His body hitting a flame hotter than he'd ever felt with clothes on, Luke grinned at the woman in his arms.""Babe, I'm all yours,"" he promised.And it just gets hotter from there. This book was everything good in the smexy department. But like I said, the romance part of it really works too...just because neither one of these characters expect or want anything more. The second half of the book (when they aren't having wild sex) was riveting and made for such a good story.I highly recommend this one. This was my first book that I've read by Tawny Weber. I can guarantee you that it won't be my last.I received a complimentary copy of this book in return for an honest review."
2014-05-1,B00CJS3USU,2.0,"Good Idea, but Highly Improbable",A3ETNNDNQI396S,"This is a good, but poorly developed, idea for a story.  It is too technical for most readers and reads like the fantasy of an undervalued IT specialist.  In fact, I would classify it as fantasy as well as mystery-thriller because the story is so highly improbable, not from a risk point of view, but from so many nations accepting the single-handed leadership of one questionable man.  That just isn't going to happen in an environment of self-centered, political leaders!!"
2014-05-15,B00CK0FXCS,4.0,Takes You Back in Time Nearly 20 Years!,A3BFDEBT5IV4UN,"This was a new author for me and I am glad I found her (them!).  It was a fun look at a generation gone by.  I  have never  seen a bookmobile before, (even though I am older than the heroine1) so the descriptions of what they are and how they work was an interesting side note to the main story.An ex-librarian/book burner/book banner  is found dead in the bookmobile. Murdered, of course! Our intrepid heroine Hester, the librarian assigned to work with the book mobile, is the one to find the body.This was a lovely fun story, a quick read perfect  to bring on a vacation it was somewhat difficult to figure out 'who-dun-it' and why, but not excessively so.  The red herring that was used to throw us off the track didn't ring quite true and was a bit pathetic...although it does make a little bit of sense.The slow chase scene was totally fun and a great way to come to a conclusion!I am now down-loading the next installment to this series."
2013-07-27,B00CK52XJY,4.0,Review: Take A Chance # 2: Love Me,A2OCN5Z5Y8E8XJ,"You can find this review at My Favorite Things(heffroberts.blogspot.com)Love Me by Diane Alberts is the second book in the Take a Chance series and continues with the story of Erica's older brother Thomas AKA Tommy that we met briefly in the first book, Try Me. Tommy Jones is in Vegas on business (yes, he even cringes at the irony of the name) and rescues Brianna Faulk from walking into a newspaperbox on his way into a restaurant, not realizing that the bombshell he just saved is also the woman he is meeting there on business. He's hot, and interested and is starting to feel ready to put his bitterness over his failed marriage behind him after eight years but Brianna keeps pushing him away. She is NOT ready to reveal her secrets, especially not to the devastatingly handsome man that will be returning to California when their business is done.A sweet romance about how our past affects our future and how obstacles that may seem unsurmountable to us are barely even there with the right person by your side."
2013-12-7,B00CK8CL0W,5.0,I love her books!,A1I0F8QMJ1G2AH,I am anxiously awaiting the next book in this new series with Lee Goldberg. It should be another fun story to follow!
2013-12-3,B00CKBJPYE,3.0,"Great premise, poor editing.",A2E427G412N5TA,"I am a big fan of the Post Apocalyptic / Zombie-esque genre, and I must say I really enjoyed this series of books.  I've read both collections, Days 1 - 8 and 9 - 16, and I can say this series is one of the most unique takes on the genre that I've come across.  That being said the reason I only gave it three stars is that the entire series is in desperate need of an editor.  In one scene dealing with a character named Mr. Blake.  Mr. Blake was referred to as Mr. Sharpe for two paragraphs, before going back to being called Mr. Blake again.  A character was referred to as someones Discipline, instead of Disciple.  There were a few issues with the words &#34;To&#34; and &#34;Too&#34;.  One character with a boyfriend named Carl, once referred to him as Carol.  None of these mistakes could be considered spelling errors, just poor editing.  If you can get over some of these cringe-worthy editing errors, and you enjoy this type of book, I would highly recommend it."
2013-11-1,B00CKBOV0M,4.0,Good read,A2F0XP91BG43G7,To me it was a slow read in the beginning and I didnt like how it ended. I left you wondering if there is going to be a part 3

2014-01-3,B00CLX3CRC,2.0,Birthright,A118OOLASTW51Q,"This is not a HEA (Happily Ever After) and I didn't like it well enough to bother reading any more in the series. The story of werewolf Alpha and human female has been done so much better by other authors. There are some totally different plot twists, but nothing that would make me want to continue on with this series. The story ended too abruptly. Not recommended."
2013-11-22,B00CMX4I1A,4.0,Loved this short story. MUST read!,A3PJKI4H7NOZ1O,"Meet the first guests to stay at the Pleasure Inn....Where all your fantasies becomes reality.I loved the first book in this series, and the couldn't wait to read about the next guests at the Pleasure Inn. And again the author did not disappoint! I fell for the professor and his student. It shocks me that we get so much story and depth in less than 100 pages. .This is the story of Marcus and Jacqueline the first guests at the Pleasure Inn. Marcus is a Professor and has always put his career before his love life. He and Logan were roommates in college. Jacqueline has just graduated college and was Professor Santos's former student and research assistant. Both have had feeling for each other but fought them because of the damage it could have caused. When Jacqueline graduates, Marcus invites her to stay with him for a whole a weekend at the Pleasure Inn as her graduation gift.Marcus and Jacqueline are perfect for each other both good looking and intelligent. The Professor/student relationship even extends into the bedroom. Get ready for one steamy weekend.Tonight the magic in this place blended her fantasy with reality. All of her desires and needs brought together by the man giving her the most amazing pleasure.We also get a little Logan and Elyse in this story! I am hooked and can't wait to read what happens next at the Pleasure Inn! I would HIGHLY recommend these books (I told Rebecca she needed to read them). They are super quick reads, with great characters and stories and HOT sex. What more could you ask for."
2013-12-20,B00CNTSVZM,5.0,GREAT BOOK!!!!,A10029891WQYIC1MIXB28,I absolutely enjoyed this book.  The characters were so likeable.  The romance was just right. The author's sense of humour was fantastic... I laughed and laughed and then laughed some more.  I am looking forward to reading more of Tiffany Allee's books.  If you want a feel good read then this is the book.
2013-06-10,B00CNTTUWA,4.0,Brazen tackles Hollywood again - this time successfully.,A2KFFFPQLK7S1C,"Robin Covington must've had a lot of fun writing her new book, Playing the Part, from Entangled Brazen. Her story about a successful romance author getting up close and personal with the handsome male lead of her best-selling novel's film adaptation is a quick, charming read with a Happily Ever After - Hollywood style.A spark of chemistry ignites between a spunky heroine and a sexy Alpha male, leading to an inevitable tangle between the sheets. In her quest to school actor Mick Blackwell on convincingly portraying a man in love, author Piper James didn't expect to find herself in a clash of wits with the charismatic womanizer. From the moment they meet on the set of Reagan's Gift, their attraction is instant, and it becomes a question of when, not if, they would give in to their mutual desires.Playing the Part is the second Brazen book set in Hollywood (the first being Cindy Dee's Femme Fatale), although I do feel it's the more successful of the two, with its perfect blend of reality and fantasy. The glamorous side of the film industry is pitted against the clinical aspects of the business as well as the drawbacks of living in the spotlight. The movie buff in me loved delving into the behind-the-scenes drama, gaining insight into the scandalous lives of the rich and famous.At its core, Playing the Part is a sweet romance involving two emotionally damaged individuals, hesitant to bare themselves to each other after having been burned in past relationships. Whether engaging in light-hearted flirtation or emotional displays of vulnerability, Piper and Mick are captivating characters. Their connection drives the narrative, enhanced by a handful of strategically placed love scenes with off-the-charts levels of steaminess.As protagonists, Mick and Piper are likable and entertaining. Romance lovers will envy Piper for her fantasy-come-true tryst with a smooth-talking biracial heartthrob (think Jesse Williams from Grey's Anatomy). The bookworm and film junkie in me were doubly delighted while reading Playing the Part and I'm excited to see what Robin Covington does next with her Playing Around series."
2013-12-1,B00CNWK5CG,4.0,Broken Series,AE4H1E8A90ZHT,"Daniel and Sofia, two different characters but meant for one another. I really felt for Daniel, the broken man he was.

Blake only has one night stands until he falls for Kara. They are both trying to take down a powerful drug cartel leader.Lots & lots of sex!!!!!!! Very steamy. Can't wait for Kyle & Myla's story.  I LOVED this story. Have read others & think this one is the best.
2014-06-13,B00CO73GA8,5.0,Love Ms. Cole's books!,A1OHF8F6JMGSIG,"I really love Tillie Cole. I read Sweet Home and Sweet Rome before this and was very apprehensive because I didn't want to be disappointed by this book, but I was pleasantly surprised. I also have a very close couple of friends who are gay and it made Tink that much more enjoyable for me. I was laughing out loud at times, which isn't a frequent occurrence!"

2014-01-10,B00CQ5C52S,5.0,The Story He Was Called to Bear,ASQW8Y9DY6LM6,"Darrell Vesterfelt, editor of the online magazine Prodigal, has a story to tell. And it&#8217;s his story, a story that he will tell you he was called to bear.Darrell is a writer. Like most writers today, he did what every publisher on the planet will tell you to do &#8211; and that is to build a platform. What publishers mean by that is having enough people who follow you on social media, read you blog, and engage with you that they will buy your book and recommend it to others. Publishers want the assurance that your book will sell, and you have to build a platform to demonstrate thatMillions of writers are out there, dutifully building their platforms. They do everything they&#8217;re supposed to do &#8211; follow people on Twitter and retweet the important ones, find the cool people on Facebook, and watch their blog statistics like a hawk.Vesterfelt was one of them, until he unblogged. Having built a successful blog (and platform), he unblogged &#8211; pulled the plug and walked away.His reason was simple. He felt himself in danger of losing himself for the sake of his platform.He describes what he did and why in a short book (or long essay) with the title of &#34;Unblogger: Discovering the Power of Story in a &#8216;How-To&#8217; World.&#34;What he did, and why, and what happened, is the story he tells. He discovered that an unblogger is first and foremost a person, a human being. The unblogger writes from experience, sharing good stories with people. And an unblogger &#8220;lives a story worth telling,&#8230;a life of meaning, and then just happens to write about it.&#8221;And goes on and says &#8220;we&#8217;re called to bear a story, our story.&#8221; And we are a character, perhaps the main character in the story. And that&#8217;s the story we bear, and the story we write.This idea of story and character is a post-modern one. An individual like me who is, on an average day, decidedly modernist has to consider the ideas of story and character carefully, that is, consider the idea that he or she is a character in a story. It works if you write the story you live. That doesn&#8217;t mean everything you write is demonstrably autobiographical, but is does mean you write from your experience.I liked this little book (or long essay). Vesterfelt has much to say. And he&#8217;s actually doing what he says to do, and is writing his story from experience, as a character in his own story.He unblogged."
2013-06-3,B00CQ9P5QM,5.0,What if... Solzhenitsyn had written SciFi,A1I7SD9S3YCQFO,"I've ended this first short story in the Archipelago Series a few days ago, but I did not write the review immediately. Not for lack of ideas or emotions, quite the contrary, it kept returning to my mind waiting for the following episodes.As I said in the title, without being irrespectful, this story could have been written by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn; it represents perfectly a distant (or not so distant?) future and the struggle for freedom, not physical freedom, but the freedom to express oneself in one the most suitable way to humanity, writing.While reading on my Kindle I found myself thinking how there was a bit of irony in doing that, too bad I cannot reveal it here without spoiling too much of this first part, but I'm sure you'll feel the same."
2013-06-28,B00CQECA1K,3.0,Story was good but...,A2EWV79XJ1B45H,"So Far the Wolf's Mate series is pretty good.  The only thing about this one is it is a little ""tame"" in some areas.  But definitely NOT the sex scenes.  I really don't know how to explain my thoughts on this one without offending anyone.  But, this is my opinion and this is my take on it:I think the story line was really good.  I think the timidness from the main female character was a little annoying.  And the main male character, he is a strong alpha type but yet he too was a little tame.  I didn't really care for these things.  There is one point in the story where Logan describes how his mate is everything to him and she means everything to him.  But in the same breath he was short with her about a misunderstanding.  (Don't want to give to much away.)  I would think that if the person is your ""true mate"" you would ask questions first.  There were just a few little areas that didn't fit the story being told. But overall, it really was a good read.So, if you can overlook a few little discrepancies, then I think you will enjoy this story."
2013-11-12,B00CQUW9YC,5.0,loved this book!,A1N06EKVN7PP5Z,I loved this book. The story was amazing and heartfelt. It was amazing Abby getting rescued and then she rescued the captain and everyone lived happily ever after!
2013-05-17,B00CQUW9YC,1.0,it's not that good.,A1TM6V8LMMX5OT,"Thankfully I got this for free from Amazon, so if you'd like to read it don't buy it, contact me and I will lend it to you.  It's not worth .99cStory is about an abused woman who falls very quickly for her rescuer.  In this case, the rescuer is a misogynistic navy captain... ok, so he doesn't hate women, he would just rather them not be in the navy, and be waiting at home for the men folk.A few typos here and there, and I believe he uses her last name before she's told him what it is (things like that bother me)."
2013-07-1,B00CR77NCC,3.0,Surprise,A2NO5W91TCT5IM,"A mediocre, predictable, if entertaining book. A complete surprise at the last. I hope the last chapter is more about action and less about being Twilight, The Space Opera without shiny vampires."
2013-07-13,B00CRS88IO,5.0,The man behind the myth,A1ASBQJRBM08ON,"Before James Bond... there was Ian Fleming, Agent 17F of British Intelligence. The setting is World War Two, and the secret agent carries out a desperate mission to persuade a maverick French admiral to lend his fleet to the cause of stopping the Nazi war machine.Through detailed descriptions, a picture emerges of the weapons, ships and even fashions of the day. From the moment Agent Fleming commandeers an aircraft to seek out the hidden French fleet, the reader is plunged into an action tour de force with a real feel of the Second World War. Of particular interest is the experience of a bombing raid by the Germans. It is as if you are racing through the city and the explosions are going off all around you!There are some interesting comparisons and contrasts to be made between Agent 17F and his creation 007. Both are young, handsome agents, with a flamboyant lifestyle. However, Agent Fleming is a bit gruffer in demeanor, though still possessing undeniable charm.This book has everything you would expect from a Bond tale: action, explosions, sultry vixens, and ironic quips. Get to know the man behind the myth: Agent 17F is at your service..."

2013-06-9,B00CTAQKIU,5.0,Great mobile app tips,ATSV9O2FD28WE,I have created an app before and wanted to get more ideas on how I can generate money from apps. The author definitely knows his stuff and provides ways you can make an app. The book even provides info on how to monetize your app if you decide to offer it for free. I was impressed with the pros/cons section about deciding which platform to use to make your app. Great job and info provided in this book.

Uggghhh I totally get the way he is because of his job but the punishment for messing up for poor Taylor are really super hard to read. I adore Taylor I just wish an she wasn't so weak towards him. I get he's trying to keep her safe but does he really have to beat her with a belt she's a EFFIN ADULT!! And nothing she did or will do should warrant that kind of abuse. Or as the the disclaimer from the author calls it Domestic Discipline! Crazzzzyyy!!I LOVE dark fiction it's one of my faves and the writers who can write the hard gritty nasty bad things in life are effin Rock stars!!!I like this series a lot I cried at both books because of his ""punishments"" I know they love each other I know he adore Taylor I just wish he'd stop that one thing.I love the SKALS That's some crazy as* crap there. HOLY HELL!I really like Josh and Monique.The writing is good just a couple of gripes:Please pull back on the giggles, his curls,the blood through ears the repetition of these adjectives is too much. I will say the giggles got less with this book. Thank you! That's my opinion as a new fan and a life long reader.Lookin forward to book 3!"

Murray is such a talented writer for her to make you experience such strong emotions for characters in this book. The storyline is gripping, I couldn't put it down and I cannot wait for the next book to come out! If you haven't started the series I suggest to start with the first book. You wont be dissapointed and they just keep getting better and better!"
2013-09-19,B00CUG91FM,2.0,What did I just read?,AABXUSGGXUY1Q,"This whole book was a waste of my time. Wow! Ok, so Dixie Rose, an ""innocent"" southern widow meets Quinn, an ass from California. She spends so much time worrying about her ""image"" to those in her community when really, she just gives it up so easily. Quinn was arrogant and I just could not like him at all. I felt so let down by this book. When I read the description, it seemed like I was in for a cute little read. It wasn't. The way Dixie Rose spoke, seems like an insult to southerners. I happen to know quite a few southern ladies who would NEVER speak like that. It was over the top. I'm sorry, but to enjoy a book, I have to at least like the characters a little. This just didn't do it for me."

2013-06-21,B00CWV34XA,3.0,First book of an alien science fiction series.,A1U3LIALASYOLZ,"At the end of this book, the author makes a plea for a review regardless of the rating so that he can understand how his work comes off. OK, I will bite.I love Science Fiction - Alien stories. The fact that you included members of the LGBT community guaranteed that I would pick it up to sample.Kudos for including the LGBT members within your cast of characters.The alien invaders and their method of conquering earth (leaving humans to kill themselves off first) was good as it showed the darker side of mankind.Most all apocalypse stories come equipped with the authors political and personal world views of the woes of society. Yet, I thought you got a bit heavy on that. Commentaries on society are best when they are implied or spoken in passing, leaving the reader the option to buy what you are selling or not. If the author (through the MC narration) hammers too hard on their own personal spin, it takes away from the characters and the action of the plot (story).This reader got caught up in wanting to knock the main character on the head for his inconsistencies and double standards, so much so that I almost stopped reading altogether.  And so it took me 3 days to finish what should have taken me one, because I kept grumbling at his ""logic"".  In short: dial it back buddy.Next, This again goes to me as a reader, I can not get into a story if the characters in the story are inconsistent, stereotypical and or  not redeemable (I need to know that they are seeing their flaws and on their way to change). I found no redeemable qualities in several of your characters. Your protagonist is hardly a good guy and your antagonist (the military guys) are whom I would be cheering for. Your heroes are just as savage as your villains, in fact more so because we do not ""know"" the military characters back stories only that the ""farm"" council (who as I have already said have questionable morals) do not like them.  I want a hero, even if it is a flawed hero. I want to see the good vs. bad and your hero and for that matter the entire council hold no hope for saving society. They are self absorbed, morally questionable and frankly most of them are stereotypical, flat characters.So does that mean I hated the story? No. It was an ""OK"" read.I liked the world building that you did.  I thought the aliens and the method of battling them was original.Yet in the end, I do not know that I would pick up another episode in this series as I am not emotionally invested in your cast of characters enough to see what happens.Yet having stated all that, I think that readers of the Science Fiction genre may enjoy this title."
2014-03-2,B00CXFH4MC,4.0,Interesting,A104ZV8AHDTTQP,A reminder as to why I don't read much of this type. The story had excellent build up but I was rather disappointed with the ending. I would still recommend it as a decent read to kill some time while waiting for an appointment. Not sure if I would pay for it but like I said this isn't my usual brand of reading.
2013-06-13,B00CXWZWAQ,4.0,Fun and Quick Read,A1168ILANAUMV8,"What a fun little hot read.  I am a sucker for shifters and for rockers, so this 1NS was right up my alley.  Mina has a fun sense of humor and I simply adore the fact that Melody was an extremely intelligent woman.  Yes she melted into a silly pile of goo for her wolf, but who wouldn't.  I hope that the author writes a story for her brother.  I found myself thinking of him long after his scene with Melody.  If you want a short, hot, fun shifter read, you will probably really like this book."

2014-02-8,B00CZQMN98,4.0,Well.......,A37HJQE83MMQ4M,"Like the books with reservations....I have not had or known anyone to have their underpants spontaneously combust when they were in the presents of a beautiful man..... For a woman who has had very little sex life, I think the love scenes make her seem aggressive and kind of juvenile.  I didn't like the cliffhanger, but could see how the book was setting it up for her health issue.  (Trying not to give anything away.  I hate spoilers).  Ended so abruptly that I'm not sure that I will go on and read the rest of the series."

2013-07-1,B00D1YGQP0,3.0,TOUGH TO LOVE: SAVING AVERY (A NOVELLA),A2YOAV9HC8HNMB,"This was a moving and thought provoking story. I have to say it had its moments where I didn't want to put it down but yet it was so sad because of the codependency that they both had in the relationship that they had with each other. But, at least there was love there for at the end there seemed to be a HEA. I thought Avery had such a hard past to work through and Steel was the perfect man to help her work through it and Steel too had his issues of being a controlling person but yet he was able to be in a place to step back especially when he asked Avery to leave and be a true man and admit he was wrong and she had to admit she was too by reacting instead of acting. As we all do when act out of fear or hurt. I have to say I did feel a little cheated with the ending of this story like we did not get find out about his career or if they finally really do get married. But it is a Novella so I guess I needed to keep that in mind."
2013-09-8,B00D247AMM,4.0,I really liked this!,AHPD9XYCN3V99,"It is VERY short, but had a cute story that kept me interested. I finished it and want to know more!!!!It was well written, well edited, funny, and had great characters. I loved the inner dialogue of both main characters. Monty, especially, was fun to read as he realized he was in love.The only cons were the length, and the author was a bit free with the rules of the time. I could overlook it though because it was a fun read. I also would have preferred a better epilogue. The ending was abrupt, and I assume its because its a series, but a good author should be able to deliver a stand alone story with a satisfying ending!"

The characters  are extremely vividand well put together from the very first pages of the book. I was completely wrapped up in the story from beginning to end. Some of the imagery was totally shocking (not a bad thing), but so vivid you swear you were completely in the head of the main character.I'm extremely interested in the next books in this series as this story is completely unique from anything I've ever read before!"

2014-06-13,B00D4CS6OS,5.0,one of my favorites,A24TUS25WCH9QH,Absolutely loved this book! I could not put it down. I felt hate and love for the different characters. And I felt the excitement and anxiety for them in the different scenes! I cannot wait to find out what happens in the next book!!! The ending just had me jumping up and down like a mad woman.
2013-10-7,B00D4FOLHQ,4.0,Enjoyed,A3CR82VBYTN4YK,Enjoyed the book. A fast read for light reading. I don't have more to say but this program requires me to say more.
2013-11-3,B00D526OEG,5.0,A fun collection,A30VYZKK7XR1IS,"This is a collection of seven short stories written in rhyme. Barky is an adorable puppy who makes new friends and has adventures that lead him to the conclusion, &#8220;I guess it&#8217;s really true that mothers do know best.&#8221;The stories are interesting and moral values are taught gently. The rhyme almost always sounds naturally conversational. The cute illustrations are not credited, so I assume art is another of Jill Porter&#8217;s talents.I enjoyed the stories, and I think my grandchildren will, too."
2013-09-1,B00D6KEIJ0,5.0,Sinfully Fun and In-Your-Face Action,A26OAZ5TKMA7Q6,"I read the first chapter and had to know more right away! What I thought was going to be a cute supernatural-filled read turned into a high-powered, tilt-a-whirl sundae with OH MY toppings.The GoodIt was even better than the first chapter had me so excited for. I met a girl that's strong and stubborn working for an investigation agency with her mom. One fabulous thing about this story that I don't see often is that her mom is a large part of her life. She tries to set Jessie on the bench during the hard cases to keep her safe, but Jessie's too stubborn for that. I love seeing this caring mother though. Jessie's father plays the role of absent parent, and his story, even how it's revealed in bits, is incredibly interesting.Lukas is by far my favorite character besides Jessie. He is the storm that rolls in and blows their town to smithereens. Handsome, charming, a bit naive, and great back-up, he brings the problem to their doorstep, but stays through thick and thin to get the mess cleared up.The story and the writing are absolutely spectacular! I didn't want to put this one down for a minute. The whole concept of the Seven Deadly Sins being personified and snatching bodies was unique and exhilarating, then Jessie and her mom having such a small deadline to be up against to save the innocents kept the pace action-packed. There are epic twists, turns, and reveals within the pages of Darker Days.The BadNone - yep that's right. I don't remember one negative thing with this book. Even the cover is pretty!The RomanceThe romance is very YA and cute to read. Jessie and Lukas make an adorable pair. Lukas is amazingly good, handsome, and old-fashioned. Jessie needs an old-fashioned guy. She's a little rough around the edges and he helps smooth them out. I like seeing the two of them together.There is an attempted rape to watch out for.ConclusionWow! Talk about an ending! How could you do that to me Accardo? Smack me with the feels and make me get all invested and emotional? What a roller-coaster ride and cliff jump at the same time, but in a good way! This story should thrill any paranormal and urban fantasy fan. Jessie may be a YA character, but there is not a lot of the YA annoyances that may turn adult readers off. Darker Days has some great supernaturals, action galore, topsy-turvy twists, and a story-line that I must see continued in a second installment! Absolutely recommended."
2014-07-8,B00D6NDM62,4.0,"4 stars for me on this little gem! I loved the story&#8230;it was cute, entertaining, and had a great flow.",A3VW9ICU2HJEL,"Seraphina is in training to become one of the highest order of angels and Cole is struggling with becoming demon or death. From worlds apart Sera has a vision that, against her better judgment, draws her to find Cole who she believes to be her human mate. After a week together she has fallen in love but forces herself to leave once she discovers his true nature&#8230;breaking both their hearts.A century later, unable to stay away any longer, Sera seeks out Cole only to realize that neither of them has forgotten what they shared all those years ago. Though hardened by embracing what he is after Sera left Cole knows she is the only woman for him and is willing to do anything to keep her this time.With outside forces doing all that they can to return Sera to Heaven can Cole keep her with him and safe? What are they both willing to sacrifice to be together?I really enjoyed this story&#8230;though I wish it had been longer because I devoured it in about 2 hours&#8230;and can't wait to dive into the continuation of Cole and Sera's story in My Demon Determined. I loved Sera and her stubborn and sometimes childish ways. She is strong-willed, curious, and refreshing. Cole&#8230;*swoon*&#8230; passionate, dominating, and frustrating as hell sometimes! I have a sneaking suspicion that we will learn a lot more about him and his situation in the next installment of this series and I can't wait! The only thing that could be improved upon, in my opinion, was more background on the characters and maybe more detail on their time together in the beginning&#8230;but that would have made a much longer book. However, I am a sucker for the details and background to really get into the characters. It was still a great read!!!If you are looking for a cute little read with some hot sex scenes that will have you laughing one minute and ready to throttle one of the characters the next you better get your one-clicker ready and go grab this little gem!"
2014-04-19,B00D6NDM62,4.0,Sensual Love Story Between An Angel and Demon!,A35EH6VHW336ML,"~4  Sensual Stars~*I was given a complimentary copy by the author in exchange for an honest review.*WOW!!!! Who knew a love story between an oracle and a demon could be so HOT? As I began My Decadent Demon, I wasn&#8217;t quite sure what to expect. However, after reading the first few paragraphs, I was hooked.Seraphina, Sera, is an oracle in training who has the gift of foresight, and one of the first visions she sees is a sexy as sin demon, Cole. However, she doesn&#8217;t know he is a demon; she just knows that his destiny is linked to hers. She sets off to find him in the human world, and he is even more spectacular in person. When the two meet, they begin a sexy, torrid affair until she realizes what he truly is. Of course, her being an angel and him being a demon would never work in her eyes, so she leaves him. Fast forward 100 years later, and she hasn&#8217;t been able to forget him. Meanwhile, he has been living half a life without his angel. She hunts him down again, and they pick up where they left off with Sera professing her love for him. Of course, fate intervenes, and they have some major obstacles to overcome. Will they be able to overcome their two very different backgrounds to find their own HEA?This book has to be one of the most sensual reads I have read. Both of these writers have a talent in engaging the senses which draws the reader deeper into the story. They use such lines like these.&#8220;He could still taste her on his tongue, could smell her exotic scent mingling with the chocolate.&#8221;&#8220;Inching closer she leaned in, savoring his voice as he spoke. It was like soft, warm velvet rubbing across her skin.&#8221;&#8220;Her lids slid closed as she inhaled his scent. Oh Heavens, he smelled raw and wild and intoxicating. Like thunderstorms and forest fires and the finest ambrosia.&#8221;And I don&#8217;t think I will ever look at candy and chocolate the same way again after their hot session in the kitchen. WOW!!!!There wasn&#8217;t one thing I disliked about the characters. Sera is one unique angel. There is a sweet innocence to her, but yet she does have this naughty side that Cole is an expert at bringing out. Cole is one hot domineering demon. All he has to do is look at Sera, and she is putty in his hands, and he is excellent with those hands! As readers will see, he may be a demon, but he certainly has a human man&#8217;s heart. They seem to bring out the best in each other, and they are a couple you are really rooting for. You want them to end up together even though they are from two very different worlds and have so much to overcome to find happiness. I will say it again. The sex scenes are UNBELIEVABLY HOT!!!Borrowing one of Sera&#8217;s quotes, &#8220;Sweet stars above,&#8221; this one fantastic, steamy, sensual book. I do have the sequel already on my Kindle. As I finish this review, I will be headed back into the sensual world of Sera and Cole to see where the two lovers are headed next. If you are in the mood for a sexy love story with great characters, I would highly recommend this one."
2013-07-29,B00D6Q062M,5.0,Nice story,A28XUAUN0OKZ66,Starts off slow but after a that you cannot put the story done.  I would recommend this book to my friends.  I will definitely read this author again.
2013-08-30,B00D6X6IP4,5.0,Unique Twist on NA Contemporary,A18VOYACEFASOM,"This was a book I was so incredibly excited about. I had read Parent's Forty Days and fell in love with her writing style. I was glad to read Precious Things and see that her style (although vastly different genres) was still apparent throughout.When I first started Precious Things I couldn't  help but think that Isabelle was slightly pretentious. However, as I continued I realized she was just a normal 18-year-old girl struggling with a huge let-down and really, a life of let-downs. Where I noticed some readers feeling hostility towards her, I felt empathy and tried to view her situation with an open mind. She continued to grow up and grow on me throughout the story.As for Evan, he was great. I love that he's not the prototypical NA male. His normalcy is refreshing. Now don't get me wrong, Evan isn't perfect, he has his flaws, but nothing too serious. He's just a generally nice guy and although he respects Isabelle, he also stands up to her when the times arise.I also really enjoyed the side characters, including Isabelle's brother (Corey), dad, and new friend, Lucy. They all brought their own challenges into Isabelle's life.  Her dad presents as one of the biggest challenges. After using her college fund to re-mortgage his small (and somewhat failing) bakery, Isabelle is forced to attend community college rather than the prestigious university she had always dreamed of. She feels resentment and anger towards her father but never feels that she can express it. Between her dad's frivolity and her absent mother, Isabelle has built a wall around her emotions. Evan helps her to realize that it's okay to express all of her emotions. I really loved Lucy. She was silly and funny. She even continued to try to be a friend to Isabelle despite Isabelle's original icy demeanor towards her (and everyone else).Precious Things is not your typical NA. There are no huge, potentially damaging secrets. It's about two normal people trying to navigate and learn about the world and themselves. I enjoyed that it wasn't about trying to uncover any big mystery but rather about Isabelle realizing and altering her perceptions of herself, others, and the world around her.Overall, I would recommend this book to someone looking for a New Adult book with a different twist. In addition, I'd just recommend this author's work, period, because she has a real craft for storytelling."
2013-11-29,B00D6XE2GQ,5.0,Good lord,A33YHG38QGS7MI,I have never cried so much in all my life.  How can you come back from something so violent so heart shattering. How do you learn to go on without the love of your life.
2013-08-9,B00D7H38ZM,4.0,Good,A2Q7XQAHNOEHV2,"This book was good but weird, not sure what i was expecting but not what i got! I will read the next one though ;)"
2014-01-21,B00D7Z4FW4,3.0,"If you&#8217;re looking for a New Adult that&#8217;s a quick read with just a little angst, it might work for you.",A85N1G9TBX8YV,"First reviewed at Red Hot Books [...]I really enjoyed the previous book in this series, Sweet, for its strong and realistic college-aged heroine. I was really hoping that the author would continue this frank portrayal of another college woman trying to navigate her way through some regrettable behaviors. Unfortunately, the book came up a bit short.Robin was your typical college party girl; the girl that&#8217;s always looking for a good time with booze or boys, preferably both. Yeah, she knows that she probably drinks a little too much and that the hookups leave her with a little bit of an empty feeling, but she&#8217;s young and dumb and having fun. All of that changes after getting wasted one night blacking out and waking up in the arms of her best friend&#8217;s boyfriend. Horrified and ashamed of herself, Robin holes up in her apartment where she sinks into a summer long depression. Robin continues to ignore her friends, terrified of anyone finding out her secret. After deciding that she&#8217;ll have to move out of the shared apartment, Robin gives in to her friend Jessica&#8217;s demands for a visit where she meets Jessica&#8217;s boyfriend&#8217;s cousin, Phoenix.Phoenix is scruffy, tattooed, two days out of jail and living on his cousins&#8217; couch. What he has in the world can be counted on one hand: $5, a felony record, a druggie mom and a bad temper. Phoenix knows he can&#8217;t offer Robin anything but all he wants to do is help the sad girl in front of him who loves art as much as he does. They embark on a friendship, despite Jess & his cousin&#8217;s disapproval. Robin isn&#8217;t sure what she wants out of life, but she admits that she can&#8217;t do it with alcohol. Phoenix becomes her sounding board and it helps that he&#8217;s totally clean too. Of course, they&#8217;re totally bad for each other, but they fall in love anyway.At first, I sympathized very much with Robin. I was a bit of a wild child in college and definitely made questionable choices. I also owned up to every one of my decisions, however much under the influence they were. So I had an issue when Robin doesn&#8217;t run and tell Kylie that her boyfriend is a scumbag who&#8217;s been trying to continue to hook up with her. Instead, she holds her secret close and only cops to it when confronted.Phoenix was really a sweet guy for being &#8220;the bad boy.&#8221; It was just life&#8217;s circumstances that led him down a dangerous path. The self-loathing of being a no good nick was ever present but only as much to be mildly annoying. In the end, I ended up relating more to his character because it felt more genuine.On one hand, I liked their relationship. Phoenix was a good foil for Robin&#8217;s nave suburban girl. He was appreciative and respectful of Robin from the get-go, so she was free to finally be who she was and not have to put on a mask. On the other hand, the insta-love was soo &#8220;insta&#8221; it gave me whiplash. They go to the park, meet for lunch, and exchange a bunch of text and then its love? Right after that there&#8217;s Phoenix getting her face tattooed on him &#8211; for a chick you&#8217;ve known for a month or two?Finally, the other two issues I had was the side story with Phoenix&#8217;s cellmate and Robin&#8217;s reaction after her cover is blown. The former felt contrived and served little purpose to the story. The latter was a ridiculous histrionic response that turned me off of the character completely. Then, in a matter of few pages, the story just whips everything together in a pretty little bow.Even though I struggled a bit with this novel, the writing is fluid and I enjoy the author&#8217;s voice. If you&#8217;re looking for a New Adult that&#8217;s a quick read with just a little angst, it might work for you.Rating: C*ARC provided by Intermix"
2013-12-19,B00DA990EK,4.0,4.5 Star Review,A3326UC548HDXO,"In Thrown by Colette Auclair, Equestrian Amanda Vogel has been forced to put her Olympic dreams on hold so she can concentrate on rebuilding her career. She's taken a job teaching actor Grady Brunswick's daughters to ride and must relocate from Florida to Colorado for the summer. While Amanda is excited to meet the handsome actor, she is not looking forward to dealing with what she assumes will be spoiled and unruly girls. She's not far off the mark. Not only are the girls running wild, needing some attention and guidance, but Grady proves to be equal parts charming and an overwhelmed single parent.After a first memorable encounter with Grady, Amanda falls into a routine with training sessions and her nightly chats with his personal chef, and BFF, Harris. She does her best to ignore the obvious sexual tension between herself and Grady but he won't leave it alone. Once Amanda finally admits to herself what she feels for him, things get complicated as she has to choose whether to chase her dream or chase what could be the love of her life.Grady Brunswick is an A-list actor who is still trying to get the hang of parenting on his own since losing his wife. He's decided to hire Amanda to give his daughters riding lessons as they both love horses. Grady likes what he sees in Amanda and begins to devise a plan to see where their attraction will take them. She resists at first, wanting to keep their relationship professional, but he can tell she feels the same way about him. Grady isn't perfect and makes the occasional misstep in his pursuit, but he hopes he can offer her a good enough reason to give him a chance.Thrown is a heartwarming story filled with funny, quirky moments. It centers on a man and a woman finding their way through life's craziness and attempting to make a lasting connection through it all.I really enjoyed this story and thought Colette Auclair's writing style had a wonderful flow to it. Each scene was set up perfectly and I connected with the characters easily. I may have had moments when I didn't want to like Grady...he had a bit of a spoiled actor ego going on, but I couldn't stay mad at him. He would always do something to redeem himself! The secondary characters were all well developed, but I admit my favorite was Harris. So. Funny. I think we all deserve to have a close friend as witty and hysterical as he was.It was so much fun to get to know Amanda and Grady. They both had a great sense of humor and were just really good people who were very caring and wanted to do the right thing. I thought it was so interesting how Grady was successful, seemed so together all the time, yet he doubted himself as a father and felt unsure around his mother. It caused him to second guess himself when he normally would be quite decisive. He was overprotective of his daughters, and rightly so, given that he lost his wife tragically. I loved that Amanda was able to tune in to the girls needs and help Grady find a balance between being their father and still enjoying time with them. They made a great team. Amanda had her own demons to fight, which caused some friction between them. I thought the fact that she presented herself as a strong person while she was struggling on the inside was something many of us can relate to.Overall, I think Thrown is a wonderful romance. If you love stories based around personal growth that include a myriad of emotions, and a lot of horse-talk, you would be hard-pressed to not enjoy this one!"

2014-02-15,B00DCX6EFM,4.0,Mer Tales,AI0FBRMXX4R8C,"EverblueI read an excerpt of this book at the end of another authors book and I was hooked. I finished Everblue in the wee hours of the night/morning. I just couldn't put it down and have already started on book 2 (Evergreen). I like that it's told from both Ash & Fin's point of views. Brenda has created characters that you can relate to (even those of us that are adults) and a world that makes you wish you could be a part of.EvergreenA good second installment of the story with twist and turns that keep you reading. Like the first book I liked that it was told from both Ash and Fin's POVs. Looking forward to reading Everlost!EverlostAs much as I enjoyed this series I was a bit annoyed/dissapointed with this book, the 3rd in the series. Rather than picking up where the second book leaves off it starts in the second book where Tatchi is left/stays in Natatoria and goes through the events that were happening in Natatoria with Tatchi while the second book was happeing on land with Ash, Fin, and the others. Although I liked finding out what had been going on with Tatchi in Natatoria I don't see why it couldn't have been given to us at the same time. For example, have the Ash & fin POVs and then a chapter in Natatoria so that you knew what was going on in both places in &#34;real&#34; time so you weren't then back tracking. And then the third book could have started where the second left off. Also, allowing for giving us more about what happens with the main characters Ash & Fin that we grew to love and followed so closing in books 1 & 2. It was frustrating that they didn't reappear until near the end of book 3 when they were the main focus of the other 2 books.I was also a bit dissapointed with how quickly everything was wrapped up. By the time we catch up with where the second book left off and we're rejoined with Ash and Fin there wasn't much left in the book. While reading I kep thinking how is the author ever going to have enough time to wrap this all up and sure enough I was left wanting more, thinking &#34;Is that really it?&#34; I wanted more both with how things are &#34;fixed&#34; in Natatoria and how things play out for the main characters (not just Ash & Fin but the others too - I don't want say more than that so I don't give away any spoilers).Don't get me wrong this book is still a decent read and I enjoyed parts of it. I just think there should be more and/or could have been done a little differently. If Brenda were to ever add to this series or have a spin-off series I would definitely read it. I still want to know what else happened..."
2013-10-31,B00DCZTLOQ,4.0,A good read,A3UJHS0M6LODOO,This series is good it ties all 3 books together ...full of action suspense and love. It's a page turner.
2013-09-11,B00DDXKA1U,5.0,The Second stand alone in the series (read this one first),A1LJDXQ4MR0YLQ,"Warner and Taddy's relationship is not what I expected.  When I got deep into the book and figured out that Warner who lost his first wife but knew how to treat a women when it came to the bedroom and beyond I knew it would be great.  However, Taddy was not willing to open up as he wanted but sure was up for the awesome sex.  Just as in The Manhattanites #1 the sex is amazing and mind blowing.  The relationships are just as great.  I would read this one first through because it gives a background about the character Lex as well as Taddy and what her parents did to her was terrible.  I enjoyed it and recieved it for an honest reveiw."
2013-09-4,B00DDZRKNY,4.0,Sexy and Different.....,A599T4SXC8IFK,"This book had some SEXY scenes.  Elodie Parkes definitely knows how to turn up the heat.The Winter Girl begins when you are introduced to Lily.  Lily is moving into a house she has just inherited because she needs to get away from her former life and more importantly her former boyfriend.  She decides that this is the perfect way to move on.  Lily isn't looking for anything serious after all she has just gone through, but she hasn't totally written off all of them.This is where we meet Ash.  Ash is the typical playboy with a small twist.  Ash is picky when he comes to women and only keeps them for a short amount of time. He always has a summer girl and a winter girl (as he calls it).  But once they fall in love he sends them on their way. Well once Ash meets Lily he thinks he found his winter girl and that's all.  Or is it.........This is where the story between these two begins.  I don't want to give too much away because it's definitely something you need to read to get the full effect.I'm not sure this romance book is for everyone.  It isn't the classic guy meets girl and they live happily ever after.  You ARE NOT going to love Ash in the beginning. This doesn't happen till towards the end. So when you are reading it's hard to get into the story and route for them to be together.  But in the end it was worth the read even though it's not a classic romance story.  It is crazy hott between these two character though.  So if you are looking for some heat.  This book will do it for you!!I give this story 3  stars.  I think everyone should give it a chance and I don't think you will be disappointed.*Written for Seductive Romance Reviews"

2013-06-18,B00DFNB3LY,5.0,"Great story, great characters with emotional element and hot sex!",AJROLS3AD3OLL,"""A friend of mine once said he knew he'd found the right Dom when he got down on his knees for him, and as soon as he was on his knees, he never wanted to get back up.""This is the story of Chase, who has not fully recovered from the break up of his previous relationship, and Derek, who is desperate to fall to his knees for him.What a perfect setting for this book! It has it all - loads of hot men in a heated environment with leather, ropes, whips, sex toys, bondage - and gorgeous characters who obviously madly desire each other! There are complexities due to inability to express feelings and past lovers on the scene to cause some dramas.The characters are wonderful. Firstly Chase (I always love a character named Chase!) who wants Derek to submit to him but needs closure on his relationship with his past submissive first. And Derek, who finds he can't get Chase out of his mind.I loved the way the characters were able to have sexual encounters with other people so long as the other was involved, even if the other was only observing. This seemed to really fit the plot and characters, rather than a forced scenario where they suddenly became monogamous to show their love. And this really seemed to fit with what Derek was looking for in a master, someone he'd be prepared to be collared for. ""I just can't find the Master Right who knows damn well that when he lets me off the leash, I'll come back, but who will still clip me to it enough to make me feel like I'm still his, you know?""Great story with an interesting plot and emotional element balanced with some very, hot and well written scenes of dominance and submission.Now I just need to find out where the nearest and next Leather Convention is being held and make plans to attend......"

The hero fell in love with the heroine despite her ethnic background. How he went about getting her was ruthless and when he had her well let just say the plot was twisted. This book comes in two parts. Buy the book is my recommendation."
2013-08-20,B00DJB6KE2,5.0,AMAZING! LOVED IT!,A3SIR4LIPNGU8,"Stripped by Jasinda WilderReview by Jen (BestSellers & BestStellars)Stripped was definitely a hot, sexy, and erotic romance.  It was filled with so many different emotions.  It will make you cry, laugh, and just make you so desperate to keep reading to follow Grey and Dawson along on their journey.  This was such an incredible romance!  The chemistry between Grey and Dawson is amazing!  It was such an enjoyable story and Jasinda Wilder did a fantastic job with this novel!Grey Amundsen is the pastor's daughter from Macon, Georgia. She's an untouched virgin and has always lived by her father's rules her entire life.  She uses dance to channel all her inner thoughts and feelings. Her father allows her this one thing, as long as her outfits aren't too sexy and her dancing isn't dirty.  One day, Grey decides she's had enough. Escaping to Los Angeles to pursue an education and career in the film industry, Grey finds herself struggling to pay her way through college. That's what leads her to taking a job as a stripper.  If she thinks her life has been changed already, when Dawson Kellor steps foot into her club and requests a dance from her, things just completely turn Grey's world upside down.Dawson Kellor is the hottest actor in Hollywood.  He's rich, he's a playboy and he's People Magazine's Sexiest Man alive.  He can have any woman he wants, but he wants Grey.  Dawson saw something in her. He saw fear, but he knew she didn't belong there. This girl was different and he had to know her.I really liked Grey.  She's sweet, beautiful, strong and smart.  I felt for her when she had to deal with her father.  He didn't want her to do anything but be a pastor's daughter, and he kept her sheltered.  Then, she finally stood up to him and left to follow her dreams of working in the film industry.  I was so incredibly proud of her.  Of course, family is important, but her father needed to realize that she was old enough to make her own decisions and choices.  She was such a strong person, working as a stripper even though she hated it, but she did it because she wanted to make something of herself.  I admire her for that.""My name is Grey Amundsen. But Grey, she doesn't exist in here, in this slimy, smoky, sex-hazed hole. In here, I'm Gracie.""I completely loved Dawson!  I loved everything about him.  The minute he sees Grey, his life completely changes.  He's so used to being a playboy and sleeping with different girls every night, but he wants to change because he sees something in Grey and he knows that she's different.""You make me feel alive, Grey. And... I love that feeling.""The sexual tension and attraction between Grey and Dawson is sizzling!  Their connection to each other is so intense.""You know I've put on, like, fifteen pounds of muscle since I met you? Because you get me worked up and then I can't get off on my own because if feels wrong, and I need to let it out, so I work out. You turn me on, just breathing.""I loved this book.  The connection between Grey and Dawson was incredible.  I could not put this book down, I was so addicted to it!  I had to know what was going to happen and I found myself hanging on every word.  There were certain parts of the book that had me laughing, crying and I loved every minute of it.  I can't even pick out a favorite chapter or part of this book because they were all amazing.  Jasinda Wilder can most definitely write some incredibly hot sex scenes.  I can't even put into words how hot those scenes were, but I seriously thought my kindle was going to set itself on fire!  She has amazing talent and I love all of her books.  I can't wait to see what comes next!The quality of writing was great.  The story was very well-written and enjoyable to read.  The story was an amazing romance between two wonderful characters, and kept me very interested!  I was glued to this book, refusing to put it down!  Jasinda Wilder did such a wonderful job and I loved the ride she had me on.  I loved everything about this book.  Grey and Dawson were amazing and you could really feel what they were going through.  I felt like I really know them, and it's not every story that makes me feel that way.  I would definitely recommend this book.  It was a little different from what Jasinda normally writes, but it is just as amazing as everything else she writes!  Trust me, you won't want to miss this wonderful read!!5 Diamonds for this incredible, sexy, amazing story!!"

It had a lot of great advice on how to set goals, the S.M.A.R.T. philosophy, and how to stay motivated when the going gets tough.  It was a short book, but provided what I needed to feel more motivated and I've began applying the steps already with great results.  I've put my goals up in front of my desk so I can see them daily and it's been helping to keep me motivated."

2013-07-15,B00DK7EGCI,3.0,3.5 star review,A3TMD3W16REBOQ,"Choices by Sydney Lane was an enjoyable read.  It was nice and quick and filled with a good love triangle.  Quincy comes from a small time and is often over shadowed by her trouble older sister. Deciding to go away with her best friend to college, Quincy hopes to break out of her shell and live a little.  I will admit, Quincy did get on my nerves at times and I didn&iexcl;t always feel for her.  I cant put my finger on it, but I just didn&iexcl;t connect.  Anyway, Quincy does meet two hot but different guys who want her heart.  The problem is she likes them both but needs to choose and unfortunately they are not only friends but fraternity brothers.  Brody is the seriously hot, panty melting,  bad boy who doesn&iexcl;t do relationships.  Declan is the hot sweet boy you bring home to your parents. I absolutely LOVED Brody, under that bad boy exterior was an amazing guy!!  While Declan was sweet he just didn&iexcl;t do it for me.  There were some serious roadblocks along the way for these three but ultimately they do find happiness.  Who does Quincy choose&iexcl;.read the book to find out. This was a good first novel for Sydney and I look forward to seeing how she grows as an author.3.5 *** read Sophie"

2013-06-27,B00DNQCZIS,5.0,Learn the healthy secrets of Apple Cider Vinegar,A1Y2R2TOJJEOE3,"Who would have ever thought that Apple Cider Vinegar had so many great health benefits?  I sure didn't.  All I know about this vinegar is that sometimes I like to put it on my baked fish, and then my kids complain about how bad it stinks.  Some people think it's weird to put vinegar on fish, but I started doing this because that's how my mom served it many years ago (she was British.)  This book explains how Apple Cider Vinegar also helps with diabetes, cancer, heart, cholesterol, weight loss, skin, hair, teeth, arthritis, etc. etc.  Seriously?  It can do all that?  Seems like a miracle vinegar, doesn't it?  Even if you're skeptical, read the book to find out why the author thinks this vinegar is awesome.  Now when my kids tell me that the vinegar stinks, I will read quotes from this book!"
2013-06-29,B00DNWKAIY,5.0,Absolutely loved it!,ACPUDZPRNNUAH,Tajana you have done it once again. If you read the Deja series this book will not disappoint. From start to finish I enjoyed the book. I loved reading more about Izzy and being introduced to the new character of Skai. I was also pleasantly surprised by the appearance of my beloved Deja characters. I'm looking forward to reading the next book in this series. In fact I'm going to reread this one. There were some minor editing issues. One that sticks out to me is manikin instead of mannequin but the minor mistakes did not take away from the story at all. Deja was my very first e-book. I will continue to purchase your books whenever they are released. You have a life long fan right here.

2013-08-7,B00DOZFGSO,1.0,"I'm sorry, but... it's not good.",ANJCSMKOXTRTS,"Having been a writer since I was 11 years old, I know how much courage it takes to put a story ""out there"" for others to read - to take the risk of rejection, while holding on to the hope that someone will say, ""Yes, I loved it."" So I applaud Ms. Elizabeth for having the courage to share this story in such a wide-open public forum.That said... she really should have kept the story private, sharing it only among friends, and asking for (and listening to) advice on how to make it better, because as it stands, the story really isn't good.Another reviewer has pointed out that the lead character, Grace, is a Mary Sue.  I agree with that wholeheartedly. The premise behind the character is interesting: a young girl who has visions of the past and future.  But the author takes the situation far beyond that, turning young Grace into a Jesus figure who ""channels the power of the sun"" and uses it to cure injuries and illnesses. Grace isn't at all 3-dimensional; she's perfection personified, as is her carrot-topped boyfriend, Chance.  We're told very little about any of the supporting characters, who are either very, very good, or very, very bad (in nature). The plot has no depth, either.  There's a catastrophe in the Silo.  Grace fixes everything.  (Well, almost everything.)  The end.Everyone has to start somewhere, and if the author's intention was simply to share her story with other WOOL fans, to join in on the party with the best work she could do, I'd be willing to cut her a lot of slack.  But, apparently, she didn't even bother to seek out the help of someone who could beta-read the story and help her correct the hundreds of punctuation, spelling and capitalization mistakes.Hanna, judging by the personal notes I've seen you post here and there, you seem like a lovely person. But I feel as if I need to be honest with you, in a way that the 5-star reviewers are not. On Amazon, you're offering your work for SALE. In a situation like that, I believe you owe it to your potential audience to give them the best - and most polished - work that you're capable of producing.  If you're working on another story, please seek out the help of a beta (an editor) who can help you with the technical aspects of writing, and one who's willing to be honest with you, so that your writing can become better and better.  I think you owe that to your audience, and you owe it to yourself.In the meantime, for anyone who's not a friend of Hanna's and simply wants to share what she's written, I'd recommend giving this story a pass.  It's not worth a dollar, and it's not worth your time."

The 12 reptiles highlighted in this book are no exception. Who knew some reptiles drop their tails when attacked by predators or smell the air with their tongues. I also learned the Green Tree Python spends most of its time climbing through the trees of the Australian rain forests. This is a superb fact book for kids with amazing photos and I highly recommend it!

2014-07-14,B00DT9ZU9A,4.0,Forever Young Jeff Erno,A1Z9JN32F9EI2O,"&#8220;Forever young we are born to run. Forever love and fun until the morning sun&#8230; Forever together&#8230; Forever&#8221; ~ Initial DWe all want our first love to last forever, yet, realistically, we know it probably won't. Circumstances change; people change; and life goes on. For Robbie of 'Forever Young' by Jeff Erno, his first love, Cole, brings along with it many firsts. Robbie has always worked hard and studied hard, but has no social life. In fact, Robbie is not truly living, he's existing, hiding behind his anonymity, with his music being his only outlet. That changes when he meets Cole. His life with Cole is fraught with passion, but also with danger. Unless Cole can restrain himself, it may be over before it has even gotten a good start.When Robbie meets Cole, he's amazed that a cool guy like him would pay attention to someone as boring as Robbie. All of his life, Robbie has tried to be as invisible as possible; shy and retiring, people constantly underestimate the person beneath the gentle faade, mistaking Robbie's kindness for weakness. Cole's interest in him makes Robbie rethink his attitude; he finds the confidence to speak up for himself, causing others to see him in a different light. This newfound self-assurance gives Robbie the push he needs to show his true colors. He impresses Cole with his understanding and loyalty which enables them to stick together through obstacles that would normally tear a couple apart. Cole is everything to Robbie and he will do anything to stay by his side.Cole is overwhelmed when he sees Robbie. He's convinced, right away, that this gentle, kind boy is someone he wants to get to know and possibly someone he could love. Cole sees Robbie for so much more than he sees himself and encourages him to be more self-expressive. Cole hates to lie to Robbie, but fears that the truth, that he's a one hundred and sixty-seven year old vampire in a seventeen-year-old body, may cause him to run screaming in the opposite direction. When Robbie learns the truth, he's certainly surprised, but is so in love with Cole that he immediately searches for a way to justify his fear and still find a way to stay with him. Cole shouldn't be afraid though, because he and Robbie are now so intimately bound that nothing can tear them apart.Although this is a Young Adult book, it's certainly not a light read. This is a teenage love story with vampires and werewolves, but it's quite different than some other vampire love stories I've read. Jeff's writing is much better and the story is by no means silly or trite. He takes his subject very seriously. I especially like the way he provides clues by tying his characters together. It's a dark, sometimes frightening story about two boys from very different backgrounds, trying to find their way in a hostile environment, while fighting off deadly enemies on all sides. It also addresses the issue of blind prejudice between the various groups involved, i.e., humans, vampires, day walkers, and Matarians, the message being that there are always exceptions and these need to be taken into consideration in any situation.I'd recommend this book to both young people and adults because, besides being entertaining, there are life lessons to be found hidden within the fantasy of the story. Thanks, Jeff, for an exhilarating read.Originally published at Rainbow Book Reviews."

2013-08-27,B00DU17TW8,3.0,"Idea gets 5 stars, mechanics of writing gets 1 star",A12DF8QSZGWVBW,"The idea represented in this book is fascinating.  It takes place in the year 2017 and the unemployment rate is around 50%.  Houses are being abandoned by people who can no longer pay their mortgages.  Companies have closed because they can no longer meet their payrolls.  The offices of Social Security, Medicare, and Unemployment and all public assistance agencies are bankrupt.  Because the government is bankrupt, fire departments and police departments have also shut down.  If a building catches on fire it just burns down.  If a crime is committed no one even bothers to try to call the police but rather citizens have armed themselves and take matters into their own hands in dealing with the criminal.In the midst of this chaotic society, a group of people travel from Nashville to the mountains of North Carolina where they can get away from some of the lawlessness and where they will attempt to live off the land. Of course, they have to defend themselves against some of the local people who decide that robbing them would be a good idea.  They very quickly align themselves with the Cherokee Indians on a local reservation so the Cherokees can teach them about hunting and fishing and growing crops and can also provide some additional ""firepower"" if bad guys attempt to harm them.Now, all this being said, I believe this is the first ebook I have ever returned for a refund.  The writing is terrible!  Some of the words misused by the author are ""and"" for ""an"", ""is"" for ""his"", ""past"" for ""pass"", ""accustom"" for ""a custom"", ""are"" for ""our"" and ""our"" for ""are"", and ""mine"" for ""mind"".  He also somewhat randomly capitalizes words that should not be capitalized.  He makes a word possessive when he intends to make it plural.  (""We have five truck's"" when it should be ""We have five trucks"".)  He has run-on sentences, sentence fragments, and question marks where the sentences are not questions.It is a shame that the writing is so terrible that it distracts from the storyline.  I do not want someone to operate on me if he is not a professional and does not know what he is doing.  Likewise, I don't really want to read a book written by someone who is not a professional and does not know what he is doing. I wish this author had hired someone to proofread this book before he put it online because the storyline was really brilliant."
2013-09-15,B00DU52U5K,5.0,I fell in love with Gavin and Taylor!,A3LLDN8AQW1LH2,"**The author of this book gave me a copy for an honest review. **What an emotional read!  By no means, upon reading the book description, did I believe this would be a happy love story.  It was definitely a topic that nobody wants to think about, but I still found myself routing for the love of Taylor and Gavin!  Cancer has invaded both of their lives and their bodies.  Would they have even met if it wasn't for cancer?  Not likely.  Gavin is a wealthy man that has built a successful business while Taylor is still a teenager.  She doesn't want to die a virgin and he would like to find love and have soneone that will grieve for him when he dies.  The author did such a great job of making you forget there was any real age gap because they were just meant to be with each other and the reader must route for their love!  I didn't want this book to end!  You probably will cry when you read this, and you will want to read this book in one sitting if possible!  I look forward to more of the author's work!"

2013-09-8,B00DW47I8I,5.0,Compelling,AGYA9YVKZT7M9,"I spotted this book on an advance notice of publication and put in on my wish list.  Something about it called to me, even before it was released. Perhaps because the only episode of the TV show ""Hoarders"" I ever watched featured a gay man. Perhaps because an older gay friend of mine slipped into hoarding several years before his death in a convalescent home. He languished for two years in the convalescent home because his own home had become uninhabitable and he was no longer physically or emotionally able to handle cleaning it out and he vehemently refused the help of friends and professionals to make it right again. Perhaps it called to me because I am retired but once made my living as a mental health therapist and, later, a social worker who made home visits and occasionally stumbled into a hoard.Jaspar, the identified hoarder in this novel, is a really likable guy and I must admit that I was grateful his hoarding was of books, newspaper and other paper products and not some of the worse things that can be hoarded to create awful health hazards.  I had to get past my own professional ethics regarding never getting sexually involved with clients to fully enjoy the book but I did let go of making too much of it and just allowed myself to take it at face value. I found myself savoring the book, reading it over several days, rather than bursting through it from start to finish like I do many books of this genre. Perhaps this was because of the memories stored in me of my, now deceased, friend and the various hoards I stumbled into as a home visiting social worker. I found that I  needed  to mentally and emotionally sort some of those memories while reading the book.  I have been in Lewis' shoes, trying to get someone to clean up their mess and it can be really overwhelming. I really liked that Lewis was self-aware enough to know his own psychological flaws and shortcomings.  If Jasper had transference, then Lewis had counter transference.This book was a very different backdrop to an m/m romance novel than any I have read so far.  I truly enjoyed it and also cleaned out a couple of closets and hauled away all of my, no longer used, professional attire during the reading of this book!  Since I retired two years ago, have gained some weight and have no desire to hang on to things I don't really have use for, this book actually spurred me into action.  Thank you, Ms. Myles!  My closets are clean, Jasper's house is cleaned and sorted, Lewis has finally found his permanent love and all is right in the world. LOL."
2014-05-20,B00DX5YREO,3.0,A Good Suspense,A2VS8HHYFK2BED,"This could be called a religious suspense or an urban fantasy suspense.  The appearance of angels and a priest who has been dead for quite some time should qualify it as urban fantasy. And it has plenty of suspense.  Several people are at risk from one source or another. Mr. Duffy has worked in many twists and turns and the reader is sure that all the &#8220;good guys&#8221; are going to be killed.The pace is good. The plot is good. But sometimes there is confusion on the motivation and attitude of the characters.  I found the sudden switch of a character&#8217;s belief of the current situation unsettling. Many of the characters were college students, so perhaps that is normal. Mr. Duffy left a couple of loose strings at the end which could have been tied up easily.PIO has a subtitle, &#8220;A Promise, A Miracle, A Second Chance.&#8221; It delivers each of those, plus a good plot and plenty of suspense."

This story has all of that and more. It has HORSES! I enjoyed this story but then again, I enjoy all of Nya's works. No two stories are ever the same.

2013-09-8,B00DY8HARG,3.0,This is the 1st Jessica Sorensen book that I was disappointed in.,AHWG1XHY140G1,"I have been reading Jessica Sorensen's books since she started doing YA series and unfortunately this was the first book to disappoint me.  I have only quit reading a book twice and since I typically love Jessica's characters as well as storylines I kept pushing myself to finish thinking it had to get better.  It was so depressing and I felt the back stories of Landon, Lexi, and Ryder were retold way too many times.  I felt better that Nova found some peace, but I felt Quinton never really developed.  While I am interested in the sequel story just to see what happens to Quinton I may have to wait to see various reviews instead of preordering the book like I usually do.Typically I give 5-star reviews, so it was difficult for me to leave this review yet since I depend on them when choosing books from an unknown author to me I felt the need to leave it for others.  I would have ranked it with less stars if it was not for Jessica's incredible ability to write and weave a storyline."
2014-02-17,B00DY8HASU,5.0,Wow,A1C7DFNSXTY09X,I would totally recommend this book along with the first book.I can't wait for the next book to see what happens to Quinton and Nova.After all they been through I hope that they get their happy ending together.
2014-06-22,B00DYAU0YE,5.0,sizzler,AU1B6RBPCPGLY,"This is an attention-grabbing quickie story packed with hot sexual encounters. Since the couple did not yet have a relationship outside of work, most of the encounters in this story are fantasy-making/fantastically inappropriate/taboo because they take place in the office - the irresistable opportunity to break their sexual tension started knocking when the couple were stuck together in the elevator during a power outage. Typical of alpha male/dom characters in romances, Jason was rather forward and aggressive and sub-like Lucy was somewhat hesistant to give in to Jason's advances, but she gave in to tempation to act on her intense attraction and their office couplings were consensual.  The characters are likeable and I was interested in reading more about the pair, so I read the follow up book, ""Twice Tempted"".  There is more story and romance in that book as well as hot sex scenes that occur outside of the office.After reading ""Tempted"" and ""Twice Tempted"", I read ""The Contract"" which is another of the author's workplace romance books.  That book is very different from Tempted; the female is the bossy/dom with respect to sexual activity.  I enjoyed and recommend all three of these funny, sexy and uniquely creatively workplace romances from this author."
2013-08-11,B00DYGCIMA,5.0,"A great story, filled with precise details on ancient civilization",A15VDLX3MLAWQD,"This is a great story set in ancient pre-Columbian North America, a place about which we know unfortunately little. Fortunately, the author's anthropological and archeological expertise informs her imagination and does a great job of filling in the blanks.Furthermore, the narrative structure does a faithful depiction of American Indian story telling. Highly recommended."
2014-06-13,B00DZ106QO,5.0,Absolutely Fantastic!,AZD488SA9QMYF,"This is by far the best vampire story I have ever read. I see that in other reviews many have said that the characters are unforgettable. That is so true. Williams has made the vampires so appealing and easy to love that I wish I had one for myself. Ambrose Slater is handsome, kind, loving, and romantic, but he is also a vampire. He falls madly in love with Abbey Lawrence, and as a couple, they make a beautiful pair. She is accepted into the entire Slater family of vampires, and everything seems perfect. Perfect--except they are vampires. Does that matter? This is such a wonderful read and I wanted it to go on and on. I loved it! Williams is a terrific writer. Can't wait to start &#34;Sisters of the Night.&#34;Carole McKee, Author"

That pretty well sums it up and what an awesomely true quote this is. I thought about this quote a lot while reading this story. I absolutely LOVE the writing style that this author has. He is phenomenally talented in all genres and now age groups. I love how this story starts off right where book one left off. I still laughed and enjoyed every minute from beginning to end. I was shocked as much as Jake was at the beginning of this story. All the heritage and ancient findings in the story amazed me and I am eager to read more about these special RUNES. The characters are still lovable and Pete is as funny as ever. I am extremely excited for the third book and by reading book two how many of these awesome little stories there will be in total. I loved the cliffhanger in this one and I am excited to learn more about Jake's nemesis. This is a RECOMMENDED MUST READ YA that will have you craving more of this marvelous Author's work. Thank you, JH Glaze, for another exciting adventure into this remarkable world you have created!! I give this story 10+ RUNES!!"
2014-01-7,B00E1IAQXS,3.0,Needs Work,AA0106JXO0TKZ,"The plot is a good one but has some major execution glitches. The characters were interesting but the constant use of 3rd person omniscient POV in talking about the characters was distracting for me. Sometimes the characters would be in 1st person present tense then there would be an abrupt switch to the 3rd person. This abrupt switching also carried over to scene transitions especially some of the action scenes. The story would be comfortably coasting along then bam we would be in an action scene. Then the action scene would be over and whup we would be coasting along with the story plot. Characters are much more real when they describe themselves in 1st person present tense when executing actions. A couple of the action scenes felt they were there for sake of action only. (I think this was mostly due to the lack of a good lead in to the scene.)After the real bad guys were revealed about 3/4 of the way thru the book, the outcome could be guessed. But I did like the execution of the final outcome.  I did not notice a lot of spelling or grammar errors which was also a plus. 64 is a good read for a rainy afternoon."

We were teased & promised that it would be worth our wait when the final product hit Amazon and Ms Wise did not disappoint!!Heart of Stone was extremely sexy, had great plots, unexpected twists, revelations, lots of intrigue, only minor syntactical & grammatical errors (which in means took detracted from the storyline), & gave closure to the situations that were created throughout the story...well maybe not ALL situations. I guess, I'll have to see if I can satisfy my curiosities in Gabe's story *wink wink*Let the harassment & threats...uh er uh...gentle nudges of encouragement, for the next story in this series, begin!!

2013-08-26,B00E3UOBG2,1.0,Worst M/M book I've read *Spoilers*,A3L2QHQN6YFWS6,"I read this entire series and I have no idea what all the fuss was about. I hated the mother. I found the 2 oldest brothers to be condescending and cruel. Like say purposely mentioning things to your brother who is prone to panic attacks just to see if he would react and say he was gay. WTF. Panic attacks are not funny. They are horrible experiences, not something to giggle about. Or perhaps punching your brother when he has just returned home after he ran off to get some time away after his family has finally figured out he was raped as a child. Seriously, these people were awful people. The mother, the father, the brothers, the wives....all of them. I won't be looking for anything by this author again."
2014-05-11,B00E3VC8EI,4.0,An original storyline,A3IYOT68EX5CXI,"This is a deserving 4 Star, even if it does take quite a while to get down to the actual plot. What makes this book so readable is that the characters are so nice. They remind me of that crowd in the George Michael video when they all head up to spend Christmas in a big house in the snow. Every single one of them are super looking, they never stop smiling (even when doing the dishes), they're never hung-over, and they all obviously love each other's company.The characters in Discovered - the goodies at least - remind me of these. What caught me completely unawares - and this isn't a spoiler - was to discover that Joey and Issy are black!! Following the initial description of Joey as ""a tall, dark-skinned young man"" and Issy as ""a beautiful dark-skinned girl"" I envisioned both of them to have swarthy, Mediterranean complexions. Perhaps there was a hint when we learn that Issy has dark ringlets hanging just off her shoulders, but I didn't pick up on. Even when we discover they're black I still couldn't shake the image of Mediterranean looking people. This threw me a little bit.But the story's well-written, the plot is excellent; No, better than excellent, enthralling. Just my kind of thing, and I would enjoy reading more of the main protagonist's story. A Discovered Part Two that focused on their story would be great.Well done to E.D. Brady for dreaming up such an engaging, compelling and even thought-provoking tale. It's exceedingly rare nowadays to discover such an original storyline, but we find one here. The book held my attention and I thoroughly recommend it."

2013-08-30,B00E7HV51K,4.0,Surviving a Natural Disaster,A3LT4D0V1WS6T9,"The author of Savage Dawn wrote a story about a group and their quest for survival after a cataclysmic event. At times, descriptions are so detailed and circumstances so real, that I believed Inge Moore was writing about her real-life experiences. Everything seemed so real, I thought that maybe she had survived the eruption of Mount St. Helen's in Washington State. I'm also assuming that the protagonist and her ex-husband were modern day survivalists prior to this event, otherwise, the cave, completely stocked with supplies, a hand-dug well and a ""secret cavern"" would not have been available.  Even so, a person has to be in the right place at the right time.  Those who weren't - weren't so lucky. Yet many of those who survived the apocalypse eventually meet their demise via disease, starvation and fellow survivors.I'm also sure that if Nina, the biologist, was not a part of this group, they would have all perished...how does someone know so much about everything! They had returned to the stone age. This group suffers through attack and molestation by other survivors and wild animals, death, severe injuries, lack of food, zero sunlight, freezing temperatures, hopelessness and a great deal of emotional stress.  Does anyone or anything exist outside of this small community? Finally, almost two years later, they discover the truth.Savage Dawn should be read by anyone curious to know what it takes to survive a major disaster that ends civilization as we know it. The ending of the story left me hanging with several questions unanswered. Perhaps a sequel will follow soon and provide the answers. Worth a read!John Podlaski, authorCherries - A Vietnam War Novel"

2013-08-12,B00EAY3V4E,3.0,In The End.. The Truth Prevails,A17126555O7KXC,"*I received an ARC in exchange for an honest review.*This novella has to be read after Moving Forward, book one in the series, however it is not needed to read book two beforehand. At only 65 pages this is a short account of Jake's story and the events that took place previous to book one that his wife Jesika soon discovered. Now I wasn't a fan of Jake during Moving Forward and unfortunately my opinion hasn't changed. Although I did get a recount of his tale and discovered his thoughts and feelings and the reasons behind his actions I didn't sympathise with him. Of course I didn't wish his untimely end but I did wish he made better decisions.The story begins from the moment Jake met Jesika and decided he needed to make her his own. From the outset we find Jake to be determined and will cross anyone that steps in his way, even his family as his cousin, Holden, finds out the hard way. There are some time jumps as the big events in his relationship with Jesika are visited. It is clear to see that Jake did love Jesika dearly, unfortunately Jake was very insecure, even though he portrayed a tough MMA fighter he wasn't confident with giving and receiving love as this was something he lacked growing up. I believe this to be the reason he was so possessive over Jesika and he feared she would leave him eventually as he never felt good enough.Jake keeps his promise to Jesika and he vows to leave the fighting world behind after one last fight, little did he know his actions afterwards would signify the beginning of the end. Now here is where my problem with Jake lies and in his letter to Jesika he admits it himself. Yes he made a huge mistake but if he came clean and told Jesika, he may have had a fighting chance with her but instead he lied and buried that lie for years, even going to extreme lengths to hide it. So even though he showed remorse every day for his actions, I wish he had the courage to tell Jesika as she deserved to know. And I will always wonder if he would have came clean on his own but alas we never got the chance to find out.I did like the note aspect of the story and I think the images of note paper was really good, it added authenticity to Jake's plea. I was perhaps expecting another revelation from Jake, as we knew most of the details uncovered in this short book so all we learned was his feelings behind it and the night of the event itself but the consequences remained the same.Erika Ashby's writing is easy to get lost in, a lot of time was covered in 65 pages and it was done well. Even though I felt In The End wasn't imperative to the story line for me, I would recommend fans of the series to read it if they want to gain a better understanding of Jake and the events that surrounded his life. ~Ava"
2014-06-19,B00EB4ZM4A,3.0,30 Days *Has* September,A14S6T4O968UKU,"This title leaped out at me because of the syntax error in the title. Author Ken Lizzi said via twitter,""Perhaps the days possess the month; say the 30 days are holding September hostage?""So I downloaded the novel. In the first chapter, we get a handsome CEO all in a dither over some employee:""I don't know what it is about you, Abby, but I can't seem to think clearly when I am round you. All my control just...just disappears.""Wow.Sounds like all kinds of executive types. Not.Then there was this:""Don't judge a book by its cover. People tend to make decisions about me before I even open my mouth,"" I bark, embarrassment making me appear harsher than I intended to sound.  ""Sorry,"" Taylor mutters.She barks!Okay, the author could stand to join an online fiction workshop (many are free, and a good way to learn the hallmarks of professional vs novice writing). I'm opposed to the 1- and 2-star bandits who download free novels and trash them. This story is fast paced and full of the features that sell well today. It reminds me in many ways of the opening of 50 Shades of Gray -- young, rich boss, employee who thinks she's merely average in looks, and instant chemistry between the two. For me, the novel is formulaic, though the big event near the end caught me by surprise. Not for a minute do I believe the one man would allow the other man to coerce him into such a horrible decision, but the woman's response, unfortunately, is believable. Authors don't usually go that far out on a limb, torturing their protagonists. Kudos to Bibi Paterson for daring to ""go there.""""Literary,"" it is not, but millions of romance readers prove that literary isn't what they're after.30 days has September,April, June and NovemberAll the rest have 31And February's great with 28And Leap Year's fine with 29songsforteaching dot com/jackhartmann/30dayshasseptember dot htm"

They both really develop as characters and the relationship gets hotter and hotter.

Sara went into work one night as a nurse working the night shift and this one night shift completely changed her life. She ends up meeting Trenton Merrick and in just one meeting the sparks go off between them. Their relationship is a whirlwind relationship. I mean it takes off fast. Sara's two friends are hilarious. The advice they give her is exactly what we girls do when we are mad at a guy. Trenton is very mysterious and Sara can't figure him out. Is he a good guy or a bad guy? She doesn't know but what she does know is that she is very attracted to him. Trenton is a little like Christian Grey but only with the Alpha Male. Sara is not one that takes orders easily, and it's funny how she reacts to the things he does to keep her safe. This book definitely has romance, mystery, suspense, and comedy. I love these types of books because it gives you everything all rolled up in one book. I suggest to read this book because you will definitely fall in love with Trenton and the chemistry between him and Sara."

2013-08-28,B00EG09YNO,4.0,"A Clever, Entertaining Variation on Harry Potter That Stands Up Well On Its Own",A2AIE9DO5QSVBD,"First things first - yes, this book is very similar to the Harry Potter series. But, it is not a clone, or a homage, or one of those lame books ""in the tradition of ..."". It is much more subtle and clever than that. It takes the whole Harry Potter style and plot and story and plays out elegant, humorous, and sly variations on the Harry Potter conventions. As a consequence it is entertaining and rewarding on its own, and also amusing in its various nods to Potter.The brilliant conceit behind the book is that our hero, Hayden, is not the boy who defeated Voldemort. Our hero, discovered and identified only after the destruction of Voldemort, (in this book known as ""The Dark Prism""), is the Dark Prism's previously unknown and unacknowledged son. Hayden didn't know who his father was. Dark Prism didn't know he had a son. So, we have an orphan, with an evil bloodline behind him, totally unaware of his magic wielding ancestors, totally unaware of magical practices, who now must be dealt with. Is he a bad seed, to be imprisoned and forgotten? Some think so. Should he be given a fair chance, as the child should not suffer for the sins of the father? Others think so. What to do? Well, he is sent to Hogwarts/Mizzenwald, his father's old school and the finest school of magic in the Kingdom. Some will support him; some will oppose him. He must determine for himself who he is and which way he will turn. How is that for a satisfying anti-Potter and a fascinating twist on the Potter themes?Everyone has a reaction when they meet Hayden and learn who he is. Not the positive ""boy who lived"" reaction, but a negative and fearful reaction. Classmates line up one way or the other, as do teachers. Luckily, Hayden develops a few friendships at school and becomes part of a smart, independent posse of free thinking and spirited fellow students. These sidekicks have great appeal on their own and are not modeled after any Potter characters, so they provide some novelty and freshness whenever they are onstage. By the same token there is a lot of detail regarding the magical community, the use of magic, the role of familiars, the operation of the school, and so on, that bears no relation to the Potter books and that stands alone as imaginative and immersive background.That said, while there is world building here, including an entire magical community, and a different magic system, and some back story, and some sub plots, this is a lighter and more nimble book than the Potter tomes. The plot moves along more quickly, the characters are sketched in more briefly, the background is provided on a need to know basis, and the sub plots and red herrings are kept to a minimum. This feels like a book for a younger reader, lacking the depth or the multi book, complex story arcs found in the Potter series. Also, while it is well written, it is written in a simpler and more direct style, where descriptions are breezier and dialogue is more casual and modern, (e.g. something might be ""superfreakingawesome"" in this book).So, I would urge you not to be put off by the inevitable Potter comparisons. This book stands on its own quite nicely, even while it manages to benefit from the Potter phenomenon's loosening up and expanding of the middle grade fiction world.Please note that I found this book while browsing Amazon Kindle freebies. Apart from that I have no connection at all to either the author or the publisher of this book."

2013-09-15,B00EJWELDC,2.0,Just doesn't work.,A2VWE5SGNDS8HW,"It's never a good sign when a book 'feels' too long. I'd been reading away for what seemed forever and glanced down to see that I was only 48% done and felt overwhelmed that I wasn't even half-way done.To be perfectly honest, the preview gave me a fairly good idea of what I was in for and I should have trusted my judgment more. But I was persuaded by the preponderance of good reviews from people who share my love for P&P; sequels and I assumed that, if they found redeeming value, I would too. Unfortunately, this was not the case.Instead I found many reasons to be frustrated and, occasionally, even irritated. First and foremost, there is very little similarity between Eli and Fitz and Elizabeth and Darcy. Everything is wrong: the way they act, the way they think, the things they do. Secondly, the whole premise is ridiculous. It's not only ridiculous for a P&P; variation, or for a 19th century romance novel--it would still be ridiculous for a 21st century romance. I didn't find it humorous, I found it embarrassing to read. Was I really expected to believe or enjoy this nonsense?Is there any redeeming quality to the book? Well, its editing is somewhat better than what has become usual lately. The author at least sticks to the premise from beginning to end. The fact that it's a silly premise aside, she's consistent. It's original. This may not be a virtue in the sense that it's good, but it is a novel thought (which hopefully will not be picked up by anyone else!)But the third reason that I did not enjoy the book is that I'm angry at myself for overruling my instinct after reading the preview and actually spending time and money (too much of both!) on something that I should have known that I would not like.My advice: read the preview, imagine pages and pages of the same, and decide if you can take it."
2013-10-10,B00EJXIO7U,4.0,A light but fun read.,A254TUPHP1P9UV,The premise has intrigue but the characters involved in murder are not as realistically evil as one would expect.  It's an entertaining read but I found the ending disappointing.

I love how Maddy and Asher meet in the beginning, how creepy he is to know so much about her, and then to have Maddy help him raise Ella as a ""Nanny"". Hope to have more great reads like this one!!"

2013-12-30,B00EN4AAFE,4.0,Nice and romantic reads that will warm you up for winter!,A1GFEMQGLB4XT6,This was a nice collection of stories that had your typical boy meets girl scenarios.  Of course not all the girls were ladies or wanted to be treated like ladies which made for some really spicy encounters for sure.  I had originally thought all 4 books tied in together but only books 1 & 2 are the same characters and continuation of story.  Books 3 & 4 are stand alone and very good in their own right and shows the depth of talent that the Author has.  Book 3 is more mystical then the others as it deals with a werewolf pack which is a totally different genre to me.  I think book 4 ended up being my favorite as it was just so different of a story!  All the books pulled you in and the characters came to life on the pages which is no easy feat for sure.  I enjoyed them all and look forward to reading more from this author in the near future.

2013-08-24,B00EOWZTHO,5.0,Fun way to learn about the importance of hygiene,A3SB8XKQ10V362,This is a nice and fun way for children to learn about the importance of hygiene. Children will learn about the germs that is bad for us when we are not careful about hygiene.  Good and colorful illustrations which will help the kids remember how ugly those germs are and how sick they can make us. Real good educational value here.
2013-09-8,B00EP5EWP0,5.0,Verra Good,A12IA29DWIP0AP,"What a fantastic story!  A little time-travel, villains in both eras, and mischievous faery characters provide hours of pure entertainment.  Verra Blue takes off where Just Beyond the Garden Gate ended, but I don't think it's necessary to have read that one before you enjoy this clever tale.  That said, once you read one you'll want to read the other.  There are a couple of 'loose ends' to make me hope that there's another book in the making.The author provided me a copy of this book in exchange for a review, and I consider myself a lucky reader."

2013-09-1,B00ER7NL8U,5.0,wonderfully sweet,AKNLA4X3MU90Z,My daughter absolutely loves this book as do I. The photos are so precious and funny. I love to pick it up and look at it with my daughter and we laugh and talk about the bunnies. So wonderfully put together by an author that most certainly knows her stuff. I highly suggest that if you have bunnies or not to pick this book up. Your kids will love it and so will you. I will be looking for more cute books by this great author.

2014-01-5,B00ES2NPAS,5.0,The Keepers: Sienna,A2C7RL4T0LPM7,"Full review can be found at: [...]Other books that I have read that only span a short period of time seem as if the characters and the story weren't developed well; however, this was not the case in this book. Rae Rivers's writing completely amazed me in this book due to the fact that, as mentioned before, the story takes place in about a day; yet, she was able to put so much emotion, context, and action that I was completely drawn into the lives of the characters. I absolutely loved reading this book! Having read The Keepers: Archer, the first book in the series, before I found that there were some gaps missing in the story; however, after finishing this book everything makes perfect sense. I loved getting to know the characters better in this book and it made me want to reread The Keepers: Archer."
2013-08-28,B00ETN5GXK,4.0,Paranormal Page Turner,ALZ36H3P06TH6,"Susan C. Muller starts you off for the first two pages with what you think will be a paranormal story that quickly becomes a murder mystery with a touch of romance. Tasked with solving a brutal murder that occurs a little too close to home, Detective Ruben Marquez finds himself running into dead ends. When he is forced into body guard duty for the murdered victim&#8217;s relative Theresa Reyna, both of them are placed in danger.This is a story of discovery for Rubin, and ultimately Teresa, as they solve the murder, work through their problems, and discover unexpected love. The book is an enjoyable read with fast paced, exciting chases and fight scenes. A police investigation that runs into roadblocks at every turn, secrets from the past, and a chilling killer keeps you reading until the last page."

2013-09-15,B00EV12YRQ,5.0,A great read for children and adults,A38JHWOEWF7Q4N,"For centuries many people believed that cats are evil or the devil took a cat form. This is a very strong belief in Egypt where I'm from, in the middle east and in South Korea where I live now. And that's the reason why some ignorant people treat cats badly and abuse those amazing creatures. I'm very happy to read a book about angel cats. A cat that trying to help humans. Such a wonderful idea and the author executed it well. I'm a cat person but it wasn't the only reason why I enjoyed the book. I enjoyed the book because it is well written and creative. Thanks Linda Deane for writing this book."
2014-01-6,B00EV5AM08,5.0,Another Michael Jospeh hit,A2KMV056844YV2,"This is the second book of Michael Joseph that I have read, the first being A New Dawn Rising. Once again we have Sam Carlisle as the hero who is an ex-cop. A man is found dead and the police rule it a suicide. His son thinks differently and hires Sam to find the real cause of death. There are many twists and turns in this book just like the first and I highly recommend both books to any mystery lover."
2013-09-8,B00EVGZXHE,5.0,Excellent information,A1W052EIGXSZ28,This was a real eye opener for me. The information in this book has been very helpful. It has given me clear direction on the things I need to do and the things I need to stop doing. Highly recommended.

2014-03-26,B00EWRZG5Q,2.0,A wasted Read!,A28Q50CI6LHQ9X,"I really tried to like this series...alas it proved too mundane for me! Book one although a drag was actually okay at the beginning because we still saw Drake as mysterious.  I disliked Elaine from early on because she seemed too juvenile for her age.  She's said to be about 26 yet she was so undecided about a lot of things and it seemed her so called feud and disappointment with her dad was just in her mind.  She also did not seem to know her own mind about what she wanted to explore sexually and kept running to the lady friend who trained Drake in his so called BD part of BDSM! She also had a friend whom she could not either cut off or take a stand against!  Just juvenile! The book was not really clich&eacute;d it was just badly written I think.I did not connect with any of the characters because for some reason there were a lot of words used to describe mundane things going on but not really much depth to the characters. The author's narrative got worse in book two that it was a sheer torture to read up to 50% of the book.Narratives like &#34;drake brought two champagne glasses for us to celebrate, stoked the fire and picked up the glasses he placed on a table by the side of the chair, and he poured two fingers, lifted his glass and toasted to us and I lifted my glass and toasted to us and we sipped as we stared at each other&#34; .... or &#34; i heard two pings on my phone and i opened my phone flap and saw a message icon at the top left corner of my phone screen and i pressed the button and the text opened and i saw i had a message from Drake&#34;.....OH MY GOD! that's the dialogue of Elaine's thoughts.  It was like that the entire book that I wanted to strangle the author for writing like that.  Who even thinks like that, it's either there is a reason why such mundane things are mentioned or skip them and get to the gist of the scene with less words.  It was horrible!It was an awful book in the end.  I couldn't even bring myself to finish it!  I was so disconnected from the entire character from skippping the long winded narratives that I skipped the scenes with ex-wife, the son, ex-wife's husband and all other useless information that did not really add to the story other than to just throw it in there.Also, Elaine was rich yet she denied her riches then abandoned her ideas as soon as she starts dating drake meanwhile she kept wearing the same dress over and over again at the first few formal events she went to - surely between her mega rich dad and boyfriend they could afford to buy her a dress! ARGHHhhhh!!! Just no show of the opulence that the author said both Elaine's dad and Drake had!They kept doing the same things over and over again with the exact same narrative which killed me more than anything.In the end, the book is a sad use of the BDSM world and certainly did not explore the BD part of the BDSM that the author said Drake had!  I ended up hating Elaine and barely tolerating Drake!  Maybe it should have ended in Book1!"
2014-03-12,B00EXOFDVU,5.0,Read It Twice.,A7HQ15OOM9YYM,"Was not what I expected from Frost the first time I read it and kinda shot through it.But went back and read it more slowly and took the time to enjoy it and found my usual satisfaction with on the second time around.Bones is hilarious,loved all the characters together and the way there was suspense plus comedy and passion."

2013-09-17,B00EYE9KWM,5.0,Steamy Farm Action,AARH1Y1HWY7UO,"In ""Disciplining Dani"" we meet Dani, a young woman who has gotten herself mixed up with the wrong crowd and sent off to her ""Uncle"" Clint's farm to learn how to become a decent woman. When she arrives at the farm she soon finds out that her mother's sexy brother-in-law has very unorthodox ways of disciplining her.I really loved the set-up for the story and Dani's punishment's were both entertaining and sexy. Whereas many of the PI books either feature a slutty or nave young woman with a devious father figure, this book doesn't feature either. Both characters are very likeable and seem great together. I would love to read more about them both."

Ranae does a great job in this story of getting you involved with the characters, Donovan and Clementine, and has you feeling what they have and do now.  I really enjoyed the true love never dies subject.  Even after being apart completely for 7 years, you can feel their love.  There are two different family &#34;appearances&#34; here that I loved, give people a chance, we can't always control where we come from, but that doesn't mean that's who we are.

2014-05-21,B00F1W0RYQ,5.0,fabulous follow up :),A1X2URS71RRMMF,"Shattered, An Extreme Risk Novel, Tracy WolffReview from Jeannie Zelos book reviewsI loved the first in this series, Shredded. Its based around characters who are Olympic standard snowboarders, and though I know nothing of this sport it didn't affect my enjoyment of the story.At the end of the last book Ash has just been told his parents and younger brother had been in an accident. His parents died and Logan, who's just fourteen, is paralysed from the waist down. Ash has given up boarding to look after him, vowing not to do a sport that Logan can no longer enjoy. Logan is a great character and I felt for him. As a wheelchair user myself I know only too well how over protective family can be, and Logan's feeling a bit trapped by it all, but can't get that through to Ash. Ash feels its all his fault as they were on the way to watch him, so its a spiral of guilt and problems the two are stuck in. Ash's friends have been trying to get him to board again in the months since the accident but to no avail. Then along comes Tansy, a tiny slip of a girl who moves something in Ash. She's from the make-a-wish foundation, and has a request from a dying child who wants to meet Ash. They don't get off well, but by some odd circumstances they end up together on a boarding trip to Chile, with the sick child and his parents and health carer.Ash is really attracted to Tansy and she to him, but what she doesn't tell him is she's a cancer survivor currently in remission. At nineteen she's been in and out of treatment for ten years, so add to her overprotective parents the fact she has none of the usual teen experiences of boyfriends, parties and clubbing. Her sister is great, younger in years but older in experience, she sends Tansy some porn sites to educate her about sex &#8211; that was really funny...I felt for Ash too &#8211; she's kept quiet because she didn't want to be thought of as Cancer Girl &#8211; where people treat you differently though they don't mean to. You lose your sense of self and become someone unreal. Been there, done that, and understood perfectly where Tansy was coming from! I don't know if Tracey has experience of herself or someone close with cancer or wheelchair use, but as someone who's in both categories ( 19 years past the time I should have died) I feel she's done both those parts incredibly well.Of course one moment everything&#8217;s going swimmingly and Ash is snowboarding for  Timmy, the dying child, who is having a great time, and Tansy is enjoying her first romance and sexual encounters, when the bomb drops and it all goes wrong. Again its handled really well, I can imagine and empathise with all of the characters in how they react. Its a great read, hot sex, adventure and a great romance too.Stars: five, one to keep.ARC supplied via Netgalley"

2014-01-21,B00F2NX6ZG,5.0,Fantastic,A1ZY5GZ05DKHF0,"Oh how I loved this book&#8230; Let me just start off by saying that Virginia Nelson did an excellent job of bringing us the emotions that can only be felt by someone who&#8217;s loved and lost and is weary of giving the person who hurt them a chance. But the overall feel of this emotion I had during this story was laughter&#8230;Braxton left Abby ten years before at the altar, but it was something he regretted the whole time. When he returns to the small town where they grew up he does everything in his power to win her back. Only problem is that she doesn&#8217;t believe he is being honest or if his feelings are from guilt.Abby felt like her life was turned upside down and she was left having to be the one to care for her ailing grandmother and other family members. At one point during the story Abby mentions to her friend that she feels that if she would have gotten married to Braxton her life might have not been the way it turned out. It gave the impression that she also held a bit of resentment against Braxton for running out on her.One thing that I loved about the story was the letters that are at the beginning of each chapter. And I would be lying if I said I wasn&#8217;t yelling at my Kindle asking it where were the letters&#8230; Getting a glimpse into Braxton&#8217;s feelings over the years to me were pure genius&#8230;Now I can keep talking about the book all day long, but then you wont have a reason to go off to buy it and read it yourself."

I don't know why but the story did not catch my interest at all.  I even tried skipping ahead to see if that would help peak my interest, but it did not.  I cannot see myself going back to read this book.  I did not like the world, the characters, or the writing style...so for me the ride stops here.  I should have tried the sample first."

So tell me why the main female character kept calling him Justin. One time could easily be taken as a typo. But no it just kept getting worse.

At the end of the last book, I loved Patton, now not so much. Melissa is so sneaky and conniving I never know what to expect. The author truly has a brilliant mind and talent for writing and has created an amazing story that leaves your emotions in a jumble. I can't wait for the next installment!"

2013-12-31,B00F6E8OUS,4.0,"A good case, uses elastic to secure the corners",A1ZU55TM45Y2R8,"I had the chance to try this case out and it's not bad. The quality of the construction is good, doesn't appear any shortcuts were taken and this thing is going to fall apart quickly with normal wear and tear. The cover provides good solid protection for the kindle screen when closed. The kindle fits into the case using the elastic straps which are ok, I much rather have seen the snap in case like the official kindle case uses, but with this one you are saving around $20 ($19 vs $39) so I can live with the elastic straps since they are black and are semi-hidden on the black border of the kindle.If you were to drop your kindle this would offer little protection to the corners but there would be a little bit. Secret here is don't drop your kindle. :)It's a good solid case, for $20 it's an ok deal."

The author is right on target with some key concepts - particularly, developing the right mind set.  I also appreciated the reference to Rich Dad, Poor Dad author's explanation of the cash flow quadrant.  Strangely enough, I have that particular audio book in my car right now!

This book follows the formula that includes alpha men which happen to be sexy and in a rock band so it was quite easy to get ""lost"" in it for an afternoon. I have not read the first book in the series, but that really didn't make a difference as this could be a standalone. But, I liked Give Me Strength so much that when I ever find the time I will read Give Me Love.DISCLAIMER: I received a complimentary copy of Give Me Strength in exchange for an honest review."
2014-04-2,B00F8GXTKE,4.0,Unfound the story of Kayla the good ghost.,A3EY9NY5Q9H2WH,"This book is a novella so it was short but creatively it has depth and insight into the world of Kayla.  Kayla was my second favorite character in The Brown House and The Crimson Key, Brylee was my first...lol, this book takes us into Kayla's life as a living breathing girl who wants what every girl wants in high school.  The Author takes you into Kayla's world and we see through her eyes how she deals with the popular girls (her tormentors) and how an on again off again booty call can get you in trouble, how a &#34;Crush&#34; can be just plain fun when you are young and naive.  And the most important lesson: if you keep a wall up and act a part it can and will backfire on you eventually. You forget about Kayla's demise until you are reminded at the end again of her fate.  I won't give away the ending you will have to read and find out for yourself."

2014-03-1,B00F93X80C,4.0,Great Start.,A3OBJGGKN1KREP,"I really enjoyed this!! Tessa Carson has spent most of her life running! Her family is unique, her mother, father, brother and sister all have physic powers.Her father was an Investigative Reporter and exposed some secrets from some very important people. A hitman was hired to kill them but thankfully they escaped. Every town they move to Tessa hopes is the last but she knows it wont be. She hates lying so keeps a very low profile. She knows the rules and has learned to be invisible. That all changes when they move to the new town and she meets Tristian. She tries to stay away but he gets under her skin and they become friends.For such a short book this really packed so much into it. Tessa is the only &#34;normal&#34; in her family. The rest all have different powers and tend to treat her like she is breakable. Her life is nothing but lies and she hates it.Tessa was a really easy character to like. She was insecure but also brave. She tries to stay away from Tristian but their chemistry was evident from the start. She has so many secrets that she doesn't want him falling for Sarah, she wants him falling for Tessa!! I loved their relationship. They are both so sweet and complement each other. Tristian as well was a wonderful character, he is so kind and caring and doesn't push Tessa. He is so understanding that Tessa starts to trust him but is it a mistake? Will she have to run again? How can she leave him now?Run To You : First Sight was packed with suspense, romance and mystery. From the get go you are immediately drawn into this world of secrets and lies. I loved the world the author has created and devoured this book within a few hours. This is a must read!!"

2013-09-19,B00FA0SCM8,5.0,A great Adventure and A Perfect Match!,A81K6ZO7ALC7D,"I'd like to begin this review by stating that this book can easily read as a stand alone.  However, book one in this series The Alpha Claims A Mate, is filled with witty dialog and characters you really do want to get to know.  I recommend book one wholeheartedly, but you do not have to stop and read it first to get 100% from The Alpha Meets His Match.This book introduces  the hero and heroine really quickly.  There are no delays here and it is a good thing; the author sets them up in all kinds of situations to show us their depth of character, why they are perfectly matched as well as why their histories make them who they are.  This books gives you it all for the hero and heroine from dislike, distrust and bad mouthing which amazingly turns into hilarity, camaraderie, respect and eventually love.This book isn't all fun and games there is a serious plot that is well developed and I personally feel Georgette St. Claire used humor in all of the right places so that the story didn't get too intense.At the end, there are bodies, plot twists, wrongs made right and a great ending.There are no cliff hangers (thank all the book gods.)  For me as a reader, as I closed my kindle I was left with a deep seated need to be assured that the secondary characters would have their own stories in the future.  Why?  Because I really loved every secondary character (OK not the villains, they got what they deserved). I look forward to the continuation of this series and will auto buy every book that Georgette St. Claire writes in the future.In conclusion buy this book!  There are so many things to love about it; but I have to say it was well worth the price just to get to know the character Pixie, she has the best one liners I've read in many many years!  I don't think I've gone to a Comedy Club and ever laughed so much!"

A wonderful book with everyday characters????????
2013-10-20,B00FAUSSC2,4.0,Great read - Cafebiblioart,ALW064XLOOPWH,"After having read the first book, I was unsure if I would love this one. To be honest, I did not love it, but I liked it quite a lot. The first book was very good and I also got attached to the characters, but it was nice finding out more about their friends in this book.I am really glad that the author kept the characters from the previous book and not just presented the story of Karen and Connor. It would have been weird, right? I mean they are friends, they go to the same school. We learnt a few things about Karen in the first book, so it's completely normal to have the other characters in this book.The book is well written and the plot as well. I must say that the author writes interesting and unique stories. I really loved the characters. Karen is quite geeky, unexpectedly so. I love that about her. To be honest, I could not imagine living her life. She lives under so much pressure, but in a way I think she enjoys it. She wants to be the best as what she does because otherwise she wouldn't continue doing what she does.Connor is the ultimate bad boy. We know right from the beginning that he is exactly what Karen should avoid. Underneath it all, he is a nice guy. He might not be the perfect boyfriend, the man to take home to your mum, but he is what Karen needs in her life. I must say that I adore the fact that he is Irish. You can almost hear his accent while reading the book. I don't usually swoon over accents, but I really liked his. (I sound weird right now, right? )I loved Karen and Connor together, they have such amazing chemistry. In the beginning, I was a bit unsure whether they could make it work, but in the end they were perfect together. They are really different and they have such different personalities, but they are perfect for each other.Overall, I am really thankful that i got to read this book as part of this tour because it was a really nice read and I hope that I will have the chance to read some more of this author's work."

2013-09-23,B00FB0FYGE,5.0,The let's will,AJNW2ORZGUDIE,Read this book reminds me a lot of fifty shades of grey but with a prophecy involved. Can't wait for more to this series. I have the first two books. Great erotic read. But that is my opinion.
2014-06-2,B00FB1616A,1.0,DNF,A1WJ7CZWGGPW8L,Where do i start...i seriously wanted to like this book. I read the synopsis and thought it would be good. Boy was i wrong. The author repeated about how much adam missed sophia. Literally every paragraph was about that! I tried to stick it out and read on but stopped at 60% of the way through. Not much dialog and not very well written . Like i said it repeats itself all the time! Characters weren't well developed and didn't make me connect to them.
2014-01-30,B00FBF4XIY,5.0,BEAUTIFUL READ,A158GAHHODYQ8W,"A beautiful love story born of legend and lore told by a master story teller.  Trevor's life choice causing him to be held at a distance by his family, takes residence in a small cottage by a remote loch.  Little did he know that an evening spent under an old oak tree overlooking the loch would change his life forever.  An excellent read for lovers of M/M genre, a tale of love between two lonely hearts who find each other and overcome their vast differences."
2013-09-30,B00FC0KENQ,5.0,AMAZING!,A1X819K3SAYJ3,"Another AMAZING book by Erik Schubach! Full of action from beginning to end; I love that this book fills in some of the back story of the previous book. We get to see more of Asgard, which I LOVED!! I loved the addition of Ina; I was a bit skeptical at first, but I ended up feeling compassion for her! She was just a poor girl that lead a horrible life and whether she realized it or not, coming down to Earth and begging to be killed was the best thing that ever happened for her. Arina is the perfect compliment to her and is the essence of Asgard and makes an amazing Valkyrie! It is fitting that she doesn't form a weapon but an impenetrable shield.I love these books! They are the perfect balance of action, romance, and humor!By the way, I loved that Ina was made Valkyrie the same way as Kate and Arina! :)Can't wait for the next one!"

It is interesting seeing the world from your cat's perspective and I believe younger kids will enjoy these see stories. If you have a very sensitive child/ren you might want to give it a quick read first to be sure they are mature enough to understand some of the real life adventures Marx goes through.I read the collection of the first three stories and the Christmas Carol story as well.  Some made me laugh, others put tears in my eyes but every one of them entertained me and my daughter. We both look forward to more books about Marx and his human friends."
2014-03-16,B00FCJ0OI2,5.0,Great follow up!,A35FHN0Z1CV3VP,"Loved it! This was a much more meaty read than the first instalment, coming in at twice the length (though of course length isn't everything, wink wink). I really enjoyed the first book, so when I heard there was a sequel I snapped it up immediately.I won't give anything away about the story, but if you're looking for a hot and heavy romance featuring a strong alpha and a vivid, colourfully painted world you just can't go wrong."
2014-01-22,B00FCKLU3E,4.0,Really awesome,A7767825ZOG1L,"I am a confirmed fan of this author, and this book is a good example of why. It's got excellent characters, a twisting plot, fantastic attention to setting, and plenty of gritty, shivery aspects. Great depictions of magic too. Though the voices are a bit samey in expression, Wilson's trademark wit and complex characters are here to fill out the ranks. Steven Moffat could stand to learn from him.I wish it had more length, though--there's a lot going on. The vampire plot is a bit extra, the nemeses seemed a bit piled on--one South African nemesis just didn't get my interest piqued for some reason, even though I wanted to like that plot. I think I need to reread it.Over all, it's a good book and definitely has me piqued for the next in the series. Also, I need doughnuts now."
2013-12-1,B00FCNKTPQ,2.0,"If this is newly edited, I'd hate to see the original",A3R97Z5AZWFFYQ,"I normally think that reviewers who complain about editing to be on the ocd side and should lighten up, but in this case the constant stream of close but wrong word was too distracting. I'm not asking for a professional editor to improve plot holes (although I didn't notice any of those). I'm talking about an alpha reader with a red pen. There is great potential for this author, and even for this book, but when typos are numerous enough to be distracting I'll put the book down rather than keep plowing through. So I did."

2013-09-27,B00FCY77DC,5.0,Broken Beauty,AE7YK39SVXT20,"This was a very different book about a subject that happens far too often. I wanted to jump inside this book and fight for Mia. Dads are supposed to shelter love and protect their daughters, not add to their pain. I'm glad she had Dom to stand by her side. It was a very good intense book to read."
2014-07-3,B00FD2JNYO,3.0,What is it with authors selling their novels piecemeal?,A14N2T7AE1FE0U,"Book two cost three times what book one did, and barely provided an hour's reading. It ended abruptly, and now i have to buy the next book to get the whole story. Good reading, though, but marred by typos and misused homophones (pouring for poring, for example)."
2013-10-30,B00FD98A96,4.0,Sweet and Steamy,A1Z5IZ93KBZKX8,"I really enjoyed Lorraine Wilson's first book set in the hills of  Verbier so I was delighted when I heard she was bringing out a second book. Note that ""SECRETS"" can be read as a standalone.The temperatures may be chilly on the Verbier Ski Slopes but trust me when I say the searing heat of the exploits indoors would melt the snow caps. SECRETS follows Flora, an employee in Chalet Repos, an exclusive resort owned by Scott and Holly whom we met in CONFESSIONS. Leaving her painful past in England behind her, Flora is determined to make a fresh start. On Holly's Hen Night Flora is dared to kiss the hottest guy in the bar. Enter Zac! Gorgeous, mysterious and dripping sex appeal, Flora throws caution to the wind and ends up playing a game of Truth or Dare with Zac that not only rocks her night but shakes her to her core.Lorraine Wilson's books are never what I expect but in the best possible way. The deceptively clean cut sweet cover hides some seriously steamy antics combined with real emotion that makes you care deeply for the characters despite the brief time you get to spend with them.I adored Flora as an MC. Sweet and kind belying the steely strength within, she made the painful decision to walk away from a toxic relationship despite being hammered for the ensuing consequences. Always putting her dreams to one side she now has the chance to do what she wants and I really sympathised as she struggled to come to terms with the fact that she was now capable and more importantly allowed to make herself happy. Likewise with Zac, it was a pleasant surprise to meet an MC who was confident without the arrogance that always seems to overpower the initial ""meet cute"" in other romance books. He too is struggling with a painful past and the connection he formed with Flora when he realised how his past and hers were linked in the most devastating of ways was  equally heart-warming and heartbreaking.Two souls equally as eager to forget their troubles for one night and instead finding that the healing they crave so desperately can be found in each other was wonderful to witness and I devoured the book in pretty much one sitting. This book is decidedly much hotter than its predecessor and there were many, many blush-worthy and entertaining moments to bring a flush to the cheeks to rival the Alpine air!SECRETS OF A CHALET GIRL is a sweet, satisfying, steamy read with great characters, a depth of emotion unseen in other romance books and very enjoyable! Highly recommend to warm you up on these chilly nights!"
2014-02-15,B00FDSL792,4.0,very sweet story,A1RN93FCV9O6CK,This is a love story that tests the bonds.  There is a good foundation of family and nice descriptions.  Emma and Rafe had been separated for three years and two important secrets happened during that time. Her fathers will stipulates she has to live in their family home two weeks each year.  Rafe is the current occupant so she pretends to be very aloof but the feelings are still there. I really enjoyed the suspense of whether they would find their way back.
2013-09-29,B00FDX59UA,5.0,Fantastic start to a new series by the fabulous Laura Wright!!,A158I3ZB8ZAMNH,I purchased the Wicked Firsts anthology and First Ink was fabulous.  I really enjoyed Rush and Addison's story.  Rush is totally HOT and a very loveable bad boy!! Rush left with a broken heart and Addison finds him to make a mends from a terrible decision she made in the past.  These two young loves are reunited and the sparks fly again!!  I absolutely loved the ink he gave to Addison.  I was very appropriate for her and them.  I can't wait to read the continuation of their story.  Another fabulous book by Laura Wright!!
2014-05-29,B00FDXFFW2,3.0,A decent read but I would like a refund,AGZWMQJT1ND2W,So the story was good it had me hooked and on the edge of my seat BUT it was way too short. The way this book ended was disappointing and wasn't worth the $5 I paid for it. There also were a lot of grammar errors. I'm sure it took all of a day to write this.

My first thought was that she was going to hire Damien as a PI, then I realized Mike had actually worked for him. They'd both been duped and double crossed.The book was very fast-paced, and the plot never left you hanging. I loved Tara's strong will and adventurous attitude. This book reminded me of Fifty Shades, but without the overly-innocent virgin. Tara knew what she wanted and made a point to get it.I would have loved to have kept reading, but I'd reached the end of the book. Maybe Laura will consider writing a sequel in which Tara and Damien seek revenge...?"

2013-11-3,B00FIOUH60,5.0,Awesome story,AWYK9GKJZFEQ8,"Books by author Kelly Jamieson are a must-read for me and I have never been disappointed in anything she has written. I've become a huge fan of her Heller Brothers Hockey series and so sad to see it coming to an end with her last book, Offside which is Matt's story and my favorite one. I was drawn to Matt and Honey's story right from the beginning after learning that there was a past relationship between them that didn't end well and their reaction after seeing each other again. I liked that these two characters were flawed, had to grow up and learn from their mistakes and overcome adversity that made them stronger. I adored Matt who was an all-around nice guy and defended Honey when others didn't give her a chance. Sure, he had a &#34;gut&#34; reaction at first but once he saw she had changed, he did everything he could to spend time with her and get her to &#34;open&#34; up to him because deep down, he still had feelings for her. He was also not afraid to express his feelings about returning to play hockey after recovering from an injury.Honey had a lot of baggage and a wild past that she had to live down and I felt so bad for her. The author did a great job writing her backstory and making her into a sympathetic and likeable character. You got to see why she acted the way she did when she was younger and how she has matured and deserved to be loved by Matt. I loved these two together, they had great chemistry and sparks flew in and out of the bedroom. They were perfect together and I could not stop reading to see what would happen next especially when an &#34;old&#34; indiscretion came back to haunt them. I loved how outspoken Matt was and how he fought to reassure Honey of his love for her; these scenes just melted my heart and had me swooning.I loved the ending of this story and getting to see the entire Heller clan one last time. The scenes were heartwarming, emotional and they brought me to tears. Thank you for writing such an amazing series with a wonderful cast of characters that I've come to love."

I actually had few days still high on them and that's normally a sign of a great read. I love that feeling where I still think of them come morning time and wonder about them as if they're real.Peyton the spoiled brat, I started with dreading her and her snobby self until Mateo make her pay for his 'lesson' and what a lesson it was. It's a priceless lesson that made you experienced her maturity growth while they cooking up some steamy dish and more.Mateo is classic alpha that we used to read in romance novel once upon a time. I love him. He has charisma, control and he helped Peyton see the world.I love how the story also focuses on Lissette and her relationship and how that was the drive for Peyton to actually wanted more out of life. The author perfectly blend angst, romance, heart breaks and humour in one.More importantly I love Peyton's journey to her HEA. From someone who self centred and hard to like, by the end of the story I came to love her. She showed strength, determination and how much she grew up.It's 5 working stars for me!!"

All frigging HOT.There is also a great amount of romance in this one.&#8220;You&#8217;ve challenged me since the day I met you. No woman has ever challenged me more. Nor made me laugh harder. There is not a moment that passes where you don&#8217;t make me feel more alive than I ever thought I could, and today you gave me something I thought was lost a long time ago for the both of us. You&#8217;ve given me peace, babe. You&#8217;ve given me everything.&#8221;While you think this should be just a sweet little novella showing the happy ever after, it was a lot more. Believe me, there is ANGST! Joss has finally broken down most of her walls, and you can really see her growth in this book. Braden, however, actually was the one who acted like a jerk. I mean, I understand it a little. His background makes it make sense, but he over-reacted and didn't give Joss a minute to talk to him.I liked this added drama, though it made me sad to read, it certainly added more of an engrossing story to what could have been a fluff read.Likes:&#8226;&#34;Best. Shower. Ever&#34;&#8226;I love Braden, it was a pleasure catching up with one of my favorite couples.&#8226;Great reminders of On Dublin Street, so you don't need a re-read.&#8226;Hot sex!&#8226;The angst made the HEA that much better&#8226;The banter is still there.&#8226;Joss's growth.&#8226;Little reminders of the two other couples that have been featured in the series.Dislikes:&#8226;Braden's reaction seemed a little out of character from what I remember.Rating: 4.5 stars for a novella, 4.5 heatVisiting with Joss and Braden was a great pleasure. While sometimes you feel cheated from a short novella, I felt like there was a lot of story packed into 97 short pages, and I loved every minute of it. I can't wait to read the next full length novel, Before Jamaica Lane. If you have not read this series, it is a guaranteed favorite!See this review with graphics and more at Ana's Attic Book Blog"
2013-12-7,B00FKERXXS,3.0,Meh...,A35CAA66C3WCTS,"Castle Hill covers several of the key moments post Dublin Street. Everything from the proposal, the wedding, and a romantic honeymoon. When they return, Joss reveals to Braden that she may not be ready for children and then boom...morning sickness. Braden is heartbroken that Joss may not want a family with him and Joss doesn&#8217;t know what she wants anymore.An incredibly short story, coming in at under 100 pages including the excerpt of Young&#8217;s next novel in the end. It seems hurried and disjointed and at the price of $2.99, I expected a bit more story. Different scenes in the book aren&#8217;t necessarily connected in any way and I just wanted a bit more bang for my buck.All in all the story was fair, I did enjoy the extra glimpse into the lives of some of my most favorite characters of all time. I don&#8217;t know if it was the smoothest of stories and could see it as a freebie on most author&#8217;s website&#8217;s, not necessarily something to be purchased. If you enjoyed On Dublin Street, you might try this, but I wouldn&#8217;t pick it up otherwise."
2013-11-28,B00FKYD7BK,4.0,Steamy Hot Erotica!!!,ARKMO0OABCW9I,"ADULT CONTENT ONLY!!!Complimentary copy provided by author/publisher for an honest review.This collection of ten short stories was hotter than I expected when I started reading. Each story covered a wide variety of people: young women, married couples, singles, swingers, same sex, FFM, MFM and each story is guaranteed to envision yourself as the star of the story. Out of the ten stories, I only skimmed one (the female/female), as that really doesn't interest me. But my overall favorite from the collection is Taylor and her tattoo artist (beef stick anyone?)"

2013-10-12,B00FOAANA8,5.0,A really great read!!!!,AR86TJD9BRPNL,"I fell in love with L. Chapman's writing in 'Trust' book 1 of the Believe Series, and I have to say that this follow up blew me away.You think you know how this story is going to play out but as you read it, L. Chapman slaps you in the face and says 'think again sweetheart'.Never did I expect Jenny's story to unravel the way it did.Of course, we met Jenny in book 1 and I liked her character than, but when we get to see some much more of her in Veiled, I now realise I love her to bits. With her wedding day only a month away, we experience so many things with Jenny and of course her best friend Megan. Her hen's night which was excellent, the distance Rich is creating between them and his reason and resulting consequences for the distance, the meeting of a new delicious man and unexpected surprises as well.The friendship between Jenny and Megan is one that I think a lot of woman would envy, they are each others constant and they support each other no matter what. Megan's boyfriend Mark also appears in the storyagain and every reason I fell for him in book 1 is still apparent in this book.The twist for Rich was something I was completely shocked with and his actions towards Jenny broke my heart, I don't think I have ever read a character that changes so completely.But enter Warren James in all his beautiful glory and Jenny's story gets VERY interesting. He handles everything thrown at him with such understanding and support for Jenny that you can help but swoon and wish he was yours.I will openly admit that at the end of the book I contacted L. Chapman because I thought my kindle was playing up and I didn't get all of the story....There is no way the story could possibly end like that....When she got back to me it took everything in me not to throw myself on the floor kicking and screaming 'Noooooooooooo'. You are killing me L. Chapman by leaving it like that and making me wait for more :)Seriously though, L. Chapman truly made this story hard to put down and it ended wayyyyy to quickly from my liking. I love these characters and I will wait VERY IMPATIENTLY for book 3 to be released,because I HAVE to see where their lives are heading and find out all the unanswered questions this book left in it's wake.Veiled has cemented the fact that I will without a doubt read absolutely anything that this author writes. It was a brilliant, exciting, surprising and an all round wonderful read.I absolutely recommend that you read The Believe Series by L. Chapman, you wont be disappointed :)"
2013-10-14,B00FP5BSHE,4.0,4.5 from me!,A1OO1T6GAZ34S9,"I have read all of the Firecrackers series up till now and I do have to say, I think that this book has been my favorite of them all so far.When we left Trixie in Firecracker Under Pressure, she finds out that Cy's new job was working at the fitness center that Erik owned.  (Can we say DRAMA!!!)  So like everyone else who has been reading this series, I'm sure that you were wondering what is going to happen in this book.  Well let's just say, I'm completely shocked at how this book ended.There is plenty of time spent with Trixie and Erik and Trixie and Cy.  Oh and I could tell you so much more but I don't want to ruin the story!Unlike the last book, I so didn't see the ending of this book coming while I was reading it.  We are not left wanting anything when it comes to the smut in this book because it surpassed any expectations that I may have had.With the way that this book ends, we are completely left with a HUGE cliffhanger and I am left wondering what it is that Trixie is going to do in the next book."
2014-01-5,B00FQ7A5WK,5.0,Whoa...this memoir is true?,A7AVW6MMYZ8B1,"I initially read Rupee Millionaire because no one ever thinks of wanting to be such a thing. However, here author Frank Kusy writes in his own memoir of achieving the dream.The book begins in the throes of India where this man from the UK has come to find himself. Here he becomes a horrible self-proclaimed Buddhist, he eats meat after all, and begins to write travel guides.To become better self supported he begins to sell hippy clothing brought back from India to the markets of London.Here he meets an unlikely and bullish character by the name of Spud. Their partnership is forged when Spud takes over Frank's market stall and announces he needs a partner. This begins the dream of becoming rupee millionaires which is actually 20,000 British pounds.Frank's  partnership with Spud is ironically long lasting, a ""marriage"" of epic proportions which include, Spud's threats to customers, bombings, tax evasion and threats to Frank's personal health and well being. It seems almost odd that Frank would continue to forge this relationship as long as he did.This duo will achieve the rupee millionaire dream many times over but in the end at what cost.Along the way, in his many travels to India to buy stock, Frank meets other interesting characters all of whom are in  business of some sort but meet yearly as friends. They become known as the Pushkar Posse.These very people will also shape Frank into the person he will eventually become and help him achieve the one thing he has always wanted, the approval of his Hungarian mother.After years of travel that takes the author through personal loss, danger to self, travels through India, Thailand and other parts of Asia, mental breakdown, love and self-discovery, the author ends the book in a twist that even takes him off guard.-------------------Once I started reading this book, I absolutely could not put it down. Through Frank Kusy's travels and words, I learned of an India that makes me want to meet it. I also learned of the things I also do not want to meet.Certain chapters make you want to scream at the author, others make your mouth drop in disbelief and even others make you endeared to the author and some of its characters. All in all you wonder if the tale is really true or if this is just a good story written by a man who knows India and its people well.The fact is, I couldn't care less. This book was well written and entertaining. It deserves the 5 stars I am giving it.~Naila MoonDisclosure: I downloaded a free copy of this book to my Kindle. The opinions expressed here are 100% my own."

2013-10-16,B00FRKLA6Q,5.0,L&R 5,A2PWJ4M63RDEB4,This is one of the best series that I have read. Nico and Tania are still together going through the trials and tribulations. Nico is still with the same stuff that he was doing before. Will Tania finally get tired of it or will she continue to stick around? I was NOT expecting it to end like that. Great job Drea Delgado!
2013-12-23,B00FRYZ1AS,3.0,Struggles of a Alaskan Boy,A353Y50D6SX5D9,"This book is the story of an Alaskan boy who is filled with hate toward those who have hurt him and needs to learn to respond with love and forgiveness because bitterness, after all, hurts the one filled with it most of all. The author writes in a creative and appealing fashion, portraying realistic racial tension and teenage struggles well, but does not seem to wrap up several details at the end of the story very well. In other words, while the situation between the Alaskan boy and his white teacher appear to be happily resolved after a long tension of bitterness and uncertainty, there are other individuals that the reader never finds out about. Overall, it is a creative story but could use some polishing and a better concluding scene.(I received a free download of this book in exchange for an honest review.)"
2013-11-4,B00FS1YZ20,4.0,A new addictive series.,A1FC5DO8N1F120,"Addicted!  Loved the characters in this. Rita FBI agent who is tough, but is she going to be tough enough to get through this? Jagger, who is going to be one hell of a complicated character. Frano who an evil game player. Alberto who is an evil thug. I am sure as Marita gets into this series she is going to have some surprises we won't see coming. Great start to this series.  Every three weeks there is a new episode.  Short read, but packed with the start of a good story line."
2013-12-15,B00FTUFROA,4.0,Super cute,A3HLUF8W1DCHK9,This was a great holiday romance. A reclusive artist and a New York business woman in  rural country town and a sullen teenager makes a great story.

2013-11-3,B00FUMPU1C,5.0,Dark And Dangerous-Bring It On,A179INWJ0ZLOB4,"This one was a joy to read because it had not one but several of my favorite authors and a couple not read before and there certainly is joy in discovering new to me authors. With this many in one maybe just maybe will be sated for a minute when done mind you only for a minute. I do love to read about the dark and dangerous but at times some term them bad boys too. But seriously bad for who? Certainly not the reader and because they are all that we are drawn to them, read them and want more. They really do not compare to the sweethearts out there because these guys in these books sure know how to bring it on and also know how to go after what they want and how to leave their loves satisfied, The who's what's and where's is the adventures we crave and the passion displayed,given and received is why we read these and keep coming back for more. In this one you get way more than expected a thirst so to speak temporarily could be quenched and the variety this offers adds that spice to life.The title says it all-it has something for everyone inside whatever you might be craving. A shifter who is a tracker and a fighter fighting for the ones he loves with so much passion he might not only have a son but a mate also when the hearts are done. Another shifter that has 2 sides to him and on a ranch no less. Interesting terminology in this one also that is intriguing in paranormal genre. Searching for the missing also love of a mate would seem was missing also and just might get found. And for those wanting a little bite with their man there is one who is also a mastyr at who and what he does. Most are unacceptable but being that said sometimes that alone turns out to be the only one who stratifies in a way only that it is actually unusual and is indeed perfect for a mastyr and she has what it takes to quench his thirst. Warriors -love em been around forever and certainly dangerous if you are the one they are after. Usually someone always trying to take them out too. The one who tried at one time is the one who could be defeated because a warrior is the champion who slays the heart. By now you are not in the dark but in the shadows and taken into a realm not often traveled but there is a man in the shadows and does the forbidden loves a woman and years later because of that union is the key to call for death. There steps in a man not one to back down from a challenge and together try and rid the world of the monsters that has come out to play. Last but not certainly least one last tale of a vampire and his club but so hot I understand why it might have been at the end it was so scorching you are left burnt to a crisp and would not be able to able to take anymore reading until recuperated and reshaped. As I said a little taste alot of dangerous and you find out what it truly means with the men who fit the bill of this title. Most definitely men I would love to meet and would keep but alas they are already paired or mated as it is said. When finished it will leave you searching for more to be found by each and every author offered in this set."
2014-04-24,B00FUMPY3Q,5.0,Sexy and Mysterious!,A1G57EH7F4TB1,"I love a good mystery in my erotica and this book delivers. Clara wakes up in Siberia with amnesia, in a hostile environment, protected only by her hot alpha savior Tolik. This wild woodsman has secrets of his own, and it's up to them to unravel the mutual mystery as very sensual feelings flare.Penelope L'Amoreaux is a talented writer with some serious knack for writing a sexy scene. The hot tension beween alpha Tolik and Clara has a very raw and primal feel that hit the spot. I also loved the way this sexy man is protective, possessive, and clings deeply to his secrets.Awesome start to a series. Can't wait to see where Tolik and Clara's love and lust lead them!"
2013-10-12,B00FUMUSJQ,4.0,Tyler's POV!!!!,AQ3XF1HYP2GWF,"Tyler's POV this time! Who expected that? Not me. I never even thought of getting a book from her POV since she's so new to the group. But with my changed opinion of Tyler after the last episode, I wasn't too mad that she was this week's center of attention.I LOVED getting a better perspective of what life at The Colony was like for her. Because let's be real, we only saw a glimpse of it when Reagan and the older Parker boys were there. I knew that The Colony was fishy, but I never really understood why Tyler hated it so much and why she was so determined to leave. Now I totally understand why Tyler hated her life there and why she wanted to leave her father and brother behind. (Her father really is one messed up dude. I see that more clearly now.)In this episode, I had a mixture of feelings about Tyler. Yes, in the last episode I actually started to like her though I wanted not to, and in this episode, my like for her continued. Arg! If I decide to hate a character, then why can't you just let me hate that character instead of making them all relatable and likable?! But even though I like Tyler now (Gah, I don't like saying that!), I was still frustrated with her sometimes. The sad girl is broken and kinda pathetic. You guys! She has a martyr complex! Someone needs to watch Tyler very carefully or she's gonna do something stupid like get herself killed."
2013-11-8,B00FUWGRS2,4.0,A Christmas Wish,A1J4ZZVGTNBQFE,"Kate Braithwaite is not having a very merry holiday. She is spending Christmas day at work rather than stay in her apartment alone. She was just dumped by her boyfriend by email. Getting caught in a New York blizzard might be the best thing that every happens to her. She is snowed in with Ryder Sinclair the sexy son of the store owner. They may have started off on the wrong foot but that quickly changed. The heat between these two is off the charts. Will her Christmas wish come true? I loved this holiday novella. Kate and Ryder have intense chemistry, but  they also connect on a personal level which I love. I want them to find a HEA because I care for them. This story definitely put me in the holiday mood. The author did a wonderful job in this short story."
2014-04-10,B00FUZQZHW,5.0,Outstanding,A14DMUTHSR8RVE,"I've read every one of Max Austin (Steve Brewer's new pen name) novels. Duke City Split is categorically one of his best. It rates up there with Boost, Shaky Ground, and Dirty Pool. Duke City Split is a fast read, with plenty of quirky characters and intrigue--trademarks of Brewer books. I love the way Brewer injects a stream of characters into this storyline, leaving the reader hanging and wondering where the plot train will end. I started this book at 8:00 p.m. and wound up reading it all the way through. It was worth losing a night of sleep over. I highly recommend Duke City Split to anyone who loves a quality mystery. Once you read Duke City Split, you will be hooked on Brewer's books, and with 27 of them out there you'll be hooked for a long time."

It is becoming more common for us to read about not-so-common heroes and heroines and i love how this heroine is so different but definitely modern. The love story is hot and very possessive and will leave you gasping until the last page (and probably beyond!)

There were not many typos except a part where it was supposed to be someone else talking but the author put in the wrong name!

I loved the strength of the characters, the real problems and feelings in unlikely situations. I liked that the side characters were very strong in their own right, not just filler. Defiantly worth the buy"
2013-10-28,B00FZ7R3EO,5.0,Anxiety: overcoming fear and worry,A2AMRVHQYAY6A6,"From reading this book i learned about the different types of disorders associated with anxiety, treatment options, symptoms,causes, and statistics about it.  It is these types of disorders that need special care but so little people have access to help and treatment or simply don't know where to look. i liked that this book not only talked about medical treatments but also covered on natural ways to help cope with stress associated with anxiety. There is so much to learn about anxiety, great book to pick up and read."
2014-01-11,B00FZAIKDE,3.0,Good Reading,A13QTZ8CIMHHG4,"It was nice to read a paranormal love story where they didn&#8217;t immediately jump into bed right away. The third book in the Bears series, we were introduced to Sammy, Slater and Brock before, but this is the first time we really understand what Sammy has gone through. They had her the ups and downs and made plenty of mistakes together. Parts of the story were a little bit over the top but overall I think it&#8217;s an enjoyable paranormal love story.Sammy was a very damaged character at the beginning but she definitely fights her way back to her old self. Some of the way she reacts to situations may be triggers to anyone who&#8217;s been abused. Slater and Brock work really hard to help her heal without walking on eggshells around her. It&#8217;s obvious they really care even if they both make dumb mistakes.Overall, it&#8217;s a good story, it had romance, suspense and the right amount of sexy to push it into an enjoyable erotic paranormal romance.Originally posted at Long and Short Reviews"

2014-02-26,B00G0J9CGS,4.0,"It&#8217;s really refreshing to read something that doesn&#8217;t take sex so seriously, but rather reminds readers that sex can be just fun",A85N1G9TBX8YV,"Originally reviewed at Red Hot Books [...]I loved this sexy novella from the author of the Original Sinners series.Billed as an erotic reimagining of Shakespere&#8217;s, Much Ado about Nothing, this sexy follows Beatriz, a sex blogger. Beatriz has a problem. She needs to review a sex positions manual the weekend of her sister&#8217;s wedding and the only acceptable available man to help her out is Ben, a former crush from college that rejected her.Fortunately, Ben is not about to look a gift horse in the mouth twice. He (literally) jumps on the chance to finally get down and dirty with the girl that he desperately wanted in college. There is no awkward tension as both main characters are very honest and comfortable with themselves and their sexuality.The sex is not so much sensual as it is real. Beatriz and Ben talk about the positions, ask each other about comfort levels, in other words, communicate. As they work their way through the manual, it becomes apparent to both Ben and Beatriz that the feelings they had for each other long ago never really went away. The cast of side characters only add to the story&#8217;s quirky charm.Their banter is amusing and entertaining, in typical Reisz fashion. The characters have brains and wit! It&#8217;s really refreshing to read something that doesn&#8217;t take sex so seriously, but rather reminds readers that sex can be just fun! I recommend this quickie if you are a fan of Reisz or are looking for something dirty and sexy. Now, if only we can get the author to write a full length erotic rom-com&#8230;Rating: B*ARC provided by Harlequin via NetGalley"

I love men who make big gestures. It's a good reminder that not all men are the same. Some are still genuine and knows how to keep their word. It's definitely a lovely Christmas :)"

2013-12-7,B00G2OZ3MI,4.0,a good one,A13BPK588G6YRJ,"I'm in the mood for light read, in a mood for fast paced story and light lot sexy scenes, this book just fits the criteria. I read Addison Moore's book before, she's into funny banters, smart dialogues that are not boring. Though I kinda stopped reading her books because there's just soo plenty out there that I still want to read, plus the first one really gave me the impression that there's gonna be more sex than story in her books. But this one, it has a sweet story. For once I read stepsisters that are not evil to each other."
2013-11-5,B00G2R6KT0,5.0,New favorite,A3JIH8AAZLQQ4O,My new favorite reid family book. I love the first four and I hope they continue coming and coming for a very long time.

2013-11-11,B00G6TNKJ2,4.0,Good read,A133BO84VFLKZV,The storyline was good and it did have some grammar issues. But I placed the word's that needed to be there can't wait until part 4
2014-07-11,B00G7A0UD4,3.0,Could have been better,A1BWJ1NZPV9DJ8,"This was an Ok book, meaning that it is well written but not really good, due to some things that quite grated on my nerves.This is Amber's and Marcu's love story, both damaged even though we know this from the beginning in Amber's case and since halfway through the story in Marcus's case.At the beginning of the story Marcus is a total manwhore, but when he meets Amber it's a typical love at first sight, and suddenly he is all sweet and attentive. We're then supposed to believe that this is the real Marcus, all his previous hook ups were simply a coping mecchanism for being abused. Sorry, but to me this was quite unbelievable, therefore the first thing grating on my nerves.Second thing was the fact that only in the middle of the story Amber finds out that she has PTSD, when she finally decides to make an appointment with a counselor. Evidently her previous psychologist never diagnosed PTSD (first thing ridiculous to me). The counselor tells her that she needs to accept what appened to her, and suddenly it seems like magic and she is all cured! Come on.... WTF?The only thing really enjoyable were Marcus's lame math jokes.I'm giving this 3 stars because, even though I was unable to connect emotionally with the story and really enjoy it, it is well written and a quick read, but if you search for something emotionally meaningful this is not the book for you."

2014-01-18,B00G8BHJB8,5.0,Irish - the new mma fighter in town,A3N4H84IRHH1D7,"A gritty love story, Gina hit Fighting For Irish out of the park. Kat is a young woman on the run, fighting demons from her past that should have derailed her completely when she meets Aiden (Irish). Running from past regrets himself, Irish wants nothing more than to make good on his promise to a friend and go back to his quiet ho hum existence. Gina L. Maxwell weaves her story beautifully and has you cheering for the underdog, in this case both Kat & Aiden, wanting them to finally get their HEA. Fighting For Irish deals with heinous issues, and Gina does so with conviction and sensitivity. Read this in one sitting, I couldn't put it down.#maxwellmob"

He's watched how others have bullied her and he knows she is special=to others who are down on their luck and children and lone dogs.The reason I wanted to read this book is because I love holiday books and love the setting of the Yellowstone River in this one.He asks her for a date and she agrees after hearing how he got back the 3 bullies in the diner.She had given up wishing on a star, maybe this one would be different...He sets teh record straight when he asks to walk her home and she can't believe he is true to his word.She tells him why they don't even set up a tree any longer..

2013-12-16,B00GADB2M6,5.0,This is  an amazing series!,AYN1UP67OP2SW,I was not able to put theses books down. I was up every night till at least 2:30am over the course of reading them. I Felt so may emotions from them. I felt I was there with  Triss and Logan. Each book left you wanting more and left you with the thought of  what  is going to happen. The suspense was intense.This series I would recommend for young teens and adults alike.
2013-11-20,B00GBIFKF0,4.0,Unconventional Cinderella Story!,A1DTCJK63GY4EU,"Great story, very different love story than any I have read lately. These are two broken people that come together in journey of self-discovery and love. I like that neither is perfect- each have baggage - and both are kind of eccentric. I know a reviewer said that s/he didn&#8217;t like the first person style (which is not reason to give a 1 star review, just dont read it...ugh?) but although it has never been my favorite it totally worked here. The author is really careful with it so it isn&#8217;t distracting at all. Furthermore, I think it gave more of a connection to the Hero because she truly read him,  she let us know about his changes as seen through her eyes which it makes it sweeter. It just fit the story perfectly. The sex was hot but didn&#8217;t take over the storyline. I gave 4 stars because there was a point before the end that it dragged and distracted me a little. I definitely recommend this unconventional Cinderella Story!"
2014-06-10,B00GCDODSE,4.0,Great read,A2AN0JZQXXOVI5,"got the first book in this series on my kindle for free, had never read Jean Oram before. It is truly a great read a little bit of everything. If you love series books read this and the other two."

I love that the paranormal twist to this book was ghosts, definitely something different for me.  The mystery and the unexpected twists throughtout the underlying love story is excellent.  The characters were great.  There are fun people you just adore, horrible people you wish you could punch in the face, and quirky people you don't know if you like or don't.  Not an overly emotional book, but it will have you feeling multiple ways while you take this reading journey.  A must read, if you ask me!"

2013-11-17,B00GOIZXJU,4.0,Still Going Strong,A15IF7NAB1Y196,"This latest installment of this series was action packed and moved the plot forward quite a bit.  We follow up from the last episode when our youthful hero hears an unexpected message, letting him know his sister is still alive.  I enjoyed the daring rescue and the additional characters added but I puzzled why Marcus has not done more in the past to eliminate the Jackal threat.  Oh, well, he is still just a kid and the last two episodes have seen him cut quite a hole in the Jackals' numbers.  This reminds me of episodic television, and this is good entertainment."
2013-11-22,B00GQ0O54A,5.0,SPOILERS INCLUDED IN THIS REVIEW,A2QC9Q8EVBI6D1,"Fetched by Zoe Dawson(Novella companion to the Going to the Dogs Series)Source: AuthorRating: 5/5 stars**SPOILERS!!  Stop reading if you have not read Poe&#8217;s book**POE!!!!  Do I really need to say anything else?Fetched is a super-super-sweet novella that is a part of Zoe Dawson&#8217;s Going to the Dogs series and is a brilliant companion to a series I absolutely adore.  Here&#8217;s the skinny on Fetched: at the end of Hounded (Poe&#8217;s book) Poe was all kinds of blissfully engaged to the &uuml;ber-hot Jared and set to start her career as a veterinarian.  As Fetched opens, the bliss is continuing to roll on in as we discover Poe is not only engaged but also pregnant!  Sheesh!!  Hot guy, the Terrible Two, Daisy, a baby and now, to make everything all legitimate, a quick wedding in Vegas hosted by Harper.  To say Poe has been handed a plate full of awesome doesn&#8217;t even come close so why is she so crappin&#8217; stressed out and unsure of where her seemingly perfect life is headed?Although the teensiest bit unsure of what the future holds, Poe boards the plane to Vegas and greets the dog park girls with open arms and a big smile.  True to form, Harper (aka the blonde juggernaut!) has taken care of nearly everything and what she couldn&#8217;t deal with, the ever-resourceful Brooke has covered.  All Poe has to do is enjoy her time in a monster suite, shag her fantastic fianc&eacute; and walk down the aisle when the time is right.  If only she could shake those nagging feelings she keeps pushing aside.The Bottom Line: Fetched is Poe at her finest and I am soooo glad Zoe Dawson added this novella to the Dogs series!!  Fetched is in no way about answering any unanswered questions from Hounded (there weren&#8217;t any!) but about furthering Poe and Jared&#8217;s story and giving fans of the series a wonderful treat that is the Vegas wedding.  Dear Lord, the scene with Daisy at the wedding is hysterical and completely unexpected in the best way possible.  If you have read and loved this series as I have then Fetched will only increase your love and leave you wondering as it has me, if Dawson is going to give us three more companion novellas &#61514;"

2014-01-15,B00GQ6CZRS,4.0,4.5 Stars,A1F5ZAUCP4KDVG,"Rating: 4.5 StarsCandice Salinas is an aspiring writer and a creative writing grad student from the University of Miami. She wanted to make a name for herself as Candice Salinas. But secretly, she had already made a name for herself as the new erotic romance author sensation &#8211; Candy Sloane. Although she was selling books and have garnered a lot of good reviews, not to mention some really great fans &#8211; if the university founds out, she would have to kiss not just her scholarship but her chance of a PhD goodbye. Then there&#8217;s her faculty advisor, Professor Dylan, whom she wanted to impress, but it seems it was a long way to go before she can get her approval.James Walker &#8211; he&#8217;s the uber-hot local barista and, ahem, her student. She knew that student-teacher relation is frowned upon in the university, and she did try to stop whatever feelings she has for him &#8211; nevertheless, the attraction was too strong to ignore. Against her better judgment, she decides to sneak around with him. Indeed, the adrenaline rush brought about by going against the law promotes thrill that one couldn&#8217;t resist - especially when James starts to show in her writing.Candice Salinas is way to prude to be Candy Sloane &#8211; but with her best buddy Mandy, and some hot kisses from James, it didn&#8217;t take a while before Candy Sloane was out of the box. But she had to deal with her dreams, her parents, her adviser and most especially, her future.Yes, erotic romance had conquered the market since Christian Grey blindfolded Anna Steele. But what we don&#8217;t know what kind of battles have these authors fought to get their books published. Some intellectual snobs may consider them as trash, not knowing that these authors have worked hard to write, publish, and have their books promoted.I love this book, not just because James is a hottie, or because Candice has finally found the courage to out Candy. Candice may have had self-esteem issues and paranoia at first, and it have taken a whole lot of motivation from James and Maddy &#8211; but in the end, she had faced her fears, made Professor Dylan sorry for what he did, and came out.Lisa Burstein may not have been an Erotic Romance Novelist, but she had made this amazing novel encouraging new and aspiring authors, who may have once been given a bad criticism, and have their books branded as trash &#8211; what is important is not just the sky-rocketing sales of the books, but the number of readers who have thought of your book great, and who couldn&#8217;t wait for your next book to be out.&#9733;ARC Copy was given in exchange for an honest review.&#9733;"
2013-12-14,B00GQOI146,5.0,OMG!!!!!,A2R36N02V8OQU4,"So sad that this book has finally ended. Absolutely a great read. I have read all three parts of the Love, Lies, and Obsessions books and I wasn't disappointed. Hopefully there will be a part 4, but I'm very happy with how this book ended. This is a must read."
2014-06-10,B00GR4XFPU,4.0,The story flows right along...,A2VUIEKRYTJ8IF,"It IS a good intriguing story and I like the fact that the main characters are flawed - not beautiful and handsome beyond belief like most books make their main characters. The only thing I found wrong with it is that when Robyn first realizes she is being spied upon through her web cam, why didn't she cover it up? It's the simplest thing she could've done. However, it's a good read and you should really give it a try - it may just intrigue you too!Lila L. PinordAuthor of Skye Dancer"

Please to say that this one hit the spot. &#34;Dusk&#34; is sensual, intense, and interesting read that makes me want to watch more of this show.I loved the way Cerys introduces us to a hot CEO with some very complex problems. Elena is drawn to Stefan's many dark secrets and his suave good looks. It isn't long before she realizes what he is, and the real fun starts as she learns how to handle a man who's more than just a brooding billionaire.Honestly, the dark, possessive billionaire is a natural fit for meshing up with the vampire world. I'm happy someone like Ms. du Lys decided to weave the two together in such a creative way, and in a well written romance story!"

This story is awesome! It is a great mystery, jam packed with story from start to finish.It is well written, flows smoothly, easy to understand and more. The characters are well defined and easy to relate to.Jamie Quinn (female) is a lawyer who is still coming to grips with the death of her mother. A family type lawyer, Jamie is pulled into action when her autistic cousin Adam is wrongfully accused of murder. Jamie has to find the real murderer before it is too late. Complicating the matter is that Adam confessed to a murder he did not commit.I recommend this book for age 14 on up. I think you will all love it as much as I have. Will definitely be looking at more works by this author."

2013-11-28,B00GW9D8DO,5.0,Such a testament to a wonderful storyteller!,A367REBE6P8VOF,"If you were a fan of &#34;Annabelle&#34;, than you will love her new short story &#34;Alice In Wonderland&#34;. Just as wonderful, Christie's beautiful voice graces the pages introducing us to a young woman who uses her books to escape the intimidating torment of the emotional grasp her confined mother has on her. When you are taking care of someone who is solely dependent on another, for someone like Alice, it can become an emotionally draining task. Considering her mother is not the materialistic type, you can feel the desperation of being emotionally and physically trapped. Filled with emotion, beautifully written, the reader will escape into a story leaving you wanting more. From the first page to the last, what Christie has accomplished in such few pages, some cannot do in a hundred, which is such a testament to her beautiful voice as a storyteller."

2014-07-20,B00GXK2P7C,5.0,Loved it!!,A14DHYFGHKOYHZ,"This is a brilliant rock and roll romance. The strife between the two brothers has been going on for so long and the reason was based on a lie that Marcus fabricated in high school. The girl in question, Naomi, is caught in the middle and leaves to attend university. When she comes home she finds out, after joining the brothers band, that it was a lie. How she and Marcus and Theo co exist on tour creates a bit of tension. I look forward to finding out about Marcus and his rise to fame because of a video of his last concert with the band."
2014-06-17,B00GYA55XC,4.0,Romance with more character depth and evil stepmom drama!,AI430R7250VB8,"You bet I am all in on a football romance. Well I have been laying low with my own injury that I would like to attribute to football, but alas it was lazer tag. So I keep tracking my healing process to be reading for the NFL season. What better way to heal than to read football romance!When Cassie learns who her father is, she knows it isn&#8217;t going to be an easy road to travel to get to know him. Giving herself one last night of wildness before meeting him, she drags her best friend out on the town for some clubbing. Dancing horribly, but enthusiastically draws the attention of Trey Owens, the quarterback of the Sante Fe Bobcats. Not a lover of publicity or media, Trey disguises himself to have a little fun. Who knew either of them would find each other and hit it off so wildly?While Cassie knows her father is the coach of the Sante Fe Bobcats, she doesn&#8217;t know Trey is the quarterback. Put under some insane rules by her father, she must give up dating while getting to know him. But after a crazy, not nice start to their relationship, she stumbles into Trey again and still doesn&#8217;t know he is the quarterback. Well, she isn&#8217;t a sports fan, being a nerd and all, so I guess I have to forgive her some, but not totally since I am a computer nerd too and also a fan of football. Hello!Trey on his own is trying to stay out of the limelight, but falls hard for Cassie in almost a stalkerish way. When he finds her again, he thinks it&#8217;s fate and won&#8217;t let go. He too doesn&#8217;t know Cassie is the bosses daughter and they blithely go on their way to falling in love while hiding it from coaches and the media.The romance goes over a coarse of time and you see the two fall in love slowly but also in the right manner. They do find out about each other at some point and Trey is always there for Cassie when the family treats her like (sorry) s%$#! But he also keeps the romance secret for his own sanity not wanting to be the headline of the week doing the coaches daughter.Now let me take one time out and deck the stepmother, Tabetha. This is one unclassy female dog and I am sorry to use so many curse words in my review, but she makes Cassie&#8217;s life a living Hell because she feels so threatened, when Cassie does nothing to deserve it besides be a good sister&#8230;she has two half sisters. Tabetha baits her, tricks her, calls her names and in general is one woman who needs to have her ass kicked.The sisters were hilarious and also giving me some agony! At 16 and 14, they are they age where boys matter, clothing matters and their mother denies them both. Not that denying them boys is so bad, but she never lets them have their own personality. Cassie befriends them, keeps their confidences and even bails the older one out of a sticky situation. Overall, Tabetha should have been thrilled they had an older sister like Cassie around.Trey is hunky along with his two cohorts. One is dealing with an alcohol problem that the other two are trying to keep him away from. This causes some scenes of drama and ultimately comes to a head at one point. All of them are good guys, playing football and trying to live their lives outside of the media.While the love scenes were sexy, they tended to fade out towards halfway through the story. It became more about relationships at that point versus getting your game on*wink*.One Night with a Quarterback was a good introduction into a new football series I am putting on my auto by list!f"
2013-12-3,B00GZG41GC,5.0,"There is great power in forgiveness? Oh yes, most certainly.",A3384G16CPDPV,"Forgiving yourself and others is not easy. I can attest. But this book has great tips on how forgive yourself and how to forgive others for their wrong doing. People make mistakes all the friggin time.One of the important points in this book talks about expecting others to apologize when that will never happen. This is when I have trouble forgiving others but it's not their responsibility. I have the power to forgive, not the other person.Lilli mentioned the law of attraction and that can't be over emphasized. If we want positive energy, we must send out positive energy. Overall. I enjoyed it. A great read and this book can really help heal someone who needs this information badly."
2014-01-3,B00GZQTYDM,4.0,Book 4 in series,A1KOQDEBDYQ9J8,"I found the first three books in the series sufficiently interesting and entertaining to immediately order/read this ebook. It continues to be a worthwhile space opera.If you want to start reading the series, here is the order: (1)  Battlecruiser Alamo: The Price of Admiralty; (2) Battlecruiser Alamo: Fermi's War; (3) Battlecruiser Alamo: Victory or Death; (4) Battlecruiser Alamo: Tip of the Spear."
2014-01-28,B00GZUBJHW,4.0,I am enjoying this series,A27L9KT5YVAXLC,"This is a good book. It seems a shame that it is apparently only available for kindle. There are some especially nice touches with something for the Wallander fans at the beginning. Like Mankell the author uses a lot of real places in this book, a technique to be commended. While some bad things happen to the people around her, Anita fares somewhat better in this book than in the first two."
2013-12-3,B00H0MVYK6,5.0,Love This Series,A3TMVEN2AWWZ30,"When I saw this book had released it trumped every book in the queue before it. I love Colee's Unbinding fate series.When we left Addy at the end of book 3, she had lost the three most important people in three different and equally cruel circumstances. Twisted memories picks up the story a few months down the line. Addy is living in Tremain, Gage is dead, Tanner can't remember her and Jackson is a shell. This book encompasses the same emotions of the first three. Addy is still uncovering facets of information about the Akori and the past while seeking a cure for her brother's condition. When Tanner starts to feature in her life again, she has to attempt to hide their past relationship.This book is a must read. The whole series is a must read. But be warned, not everyone gets a happy ending. I can't wait for book five, Hellfire, planned for release late 2014."

It was amazing that Carly starting the story off with amnesia allowed the two soon-to-be exs the opportunity to fall back in love with each other and start over.  That is not to say that there was not plenty of things standing in their way, but they managed to overcome their issues and learn how to trust each other again.You need to read this story in order to see just what things got in their way and how they eventually wound up happy with one another.  There are lots of twists that need to be experienced in this book.Give it a try."

Jack wasn&#8217;t always alone and his ex is about to make a dramatic comeback.Every cowboy has a past and this cowboy&#8217;s past is about to destroy his future.Nanee's Review:I thought this story would be a good one, I enjoy stories with sexy cowboys but this story was a little drawn out in parts and fast paced in others. I didn't like David or Laura but I  liked Vicky and Jack. I enjoyed them together but there was no real wow to them it was somewhat glazed over no real sexy there, with Jack's crazy lesbian ex was just weird. Then the book ended..this book had great potential but missed out. 2 stars"
2014-01-8,B00H4FLIBE,4.0,A Wonderful Romance,AT962BZ3QJR1J,"This is the second in the series Ordinary Days in Myrtle Hill by Deanne Durrett. The first was Rogue's Trust, and both are awesome books.Becca McGee, a young widow with a precocious twelve-year-old daughter has accepted an enormous inheritance with awesome potential from someone she never knew. With a part of it, she purchased a huge historic mansion to be used as a home for battered women.In this novel, Becca is trying to foil two women who are attempting to block the zoning that would allow the mansion to be used as temporary shelter for these needy women and their children. She's also trying to figure out her feelings for JT Harrison and why those winks and extra attention from a car salesman are making her feel so flustered.Her feelings for either man are totally beside the point anyway, because Amy K (her daughter) constantly tells her, &#34;Second marriages are bad for kids.&#34; Unless she can figure out her daughter's objections, though, she can only meet her date surreptitiously."
2014-03-23,B00H5UAEZY,5.0,Quirky and fun!,A2CWJKA00YWN1J,"Richard Sherlock, private detective, is divorced with 2 kids and no money. He's the typical every man's kind of guy. Tiffany's not typical, but certainly fits the quirky category. This was fun to read even though not very realistic, but then who says it has to be realistic? I liked it enough to get the first 2 books in the series and look forward to reading more."

Duane, an &#8220;incurable lover of the forest and its creatures,&#8221; is the designated guardian of the woods. Like his father before him, he has inherited a sixth sense which enables him to communicate with animals. A potent Jooobaaa drink gives him the power to transform into a hairy blond WereBigfoot and to tune into his  friends' thoughts. He has been keeping &#8220;the forest safe from those who have a natural proclivity to harming its residents.&#8221;This is certainly an entertaining read for the young adult, as well as, adult crowd: complete with dirty farts, loud belches, rotten smells and constant lusting. But above all, it is a heartfelt shout-out for the simple life, and the importance of safeguarding our pristine forests and all the creatures that depend on it for their survival."

It is simply written but I guess that is the author&#8217;s style of writing. The simplicity adds to the book rather than takes away from it. Quite an insightful look at teenagers and their various problems. You find yourself rooting for the Circle of Five, you feel their emotions, and their happiness. I enjoy Jan Raymond&#8217;s writing style and would love to read the next book."

2013-12-30,B00HBUAXN6,4.0,Relationship Counselling in a Book,A11P4DJ7IXP9KI,"This was a pretty good relationship advice book. It lists many of the common pitfalls and some of the signs that lead up to them, so if you haven&#8217;t reached them then you might be able to identify them if they approach. It also has some handy tips, some of them may be common sense but others are quite practical, like different gift ideas. There is a formatting issue however; some of the sections are repeated in a different font, so you have to flick through an additional page. It doesn&#8217;t affect the content of the book but it is a little annoying."

2014-02-4,B00HCQBGIA,1.0,Pretty Pathetic Premise,A3MMC9EI9QYIHF,"After having stuck with her married-to-the-Marines husband long enough to raise their children, she walks out.  Ok so far.  Suddenly, two years later and the divorce finalized, she can't support herself (apparently alimony doesn't come into the picture--it's never mentioned) so she agrees to marry a guy ten years younger than she, whom she admittedly doesn't love and whose financial situation and family values are obviously widely divergent from hers--huh?  (She's an experienced 40-something, not 18 and pregnant, for heaven's sake!)  She's worried about finances, neighbors' welfare, etc., but doesn't read obviously important mail?--duh!  (She wants to be self-reliant, but...)  She's bargained her mowing services for lower rent for a couple years; suddenly she's like a daughter/granddaughter to the trailer park owner--o-kayyyy...?  By the way, since when are there only minimal overhead costs to running a trailer park?  Uh, speaking from experience, I don't think so: How about taxes, insurance, maintenance, road repairs, not to mention the continual headaches of non-payment of pad rents and utilities and the subsequent necessary evictions--oh excuse me, she wouldn't dream of doing that; she'll get the new hubby to cover all the neighbors' expenses.).  And then (SPOILER) she agrees to meet her not-so-charming (though admittedly somewhat humorous) Prince Charming ex for a one-nighter the night before the wedding, and suddenly all is forgiven, but still she knuckles under to her fiance's unconvincing blackmail.  Prince C rides to the rescue to saves the day so she can give her toy boy the finger.Be prepared to give a real workout to your willing suspension of disbelief if you decide to go for this one."

The book is set in the future, and if you love spunky heroines, you will love the women in this book. The book is half science fiction, half romance, and again, the plot is just wild!

2013-12-23,B00HGZEPEO,5.0,"Move Over Vamps and Wolves, The Elves Are Back In Town!!!",A2VXE1UZIN6JPU,"I am an avid Quinn Loftis groupie and with the release date for this book a couple of days away I thought I may as well stalk Amazon in the hopes it would appear early and was ecstatic to find it the day before release. I am now sitting here writing this review wishing that I could read it again for the first time and envying anyone who is about to do so!We get back to Trik, Cassie, Elora and the gang after the closing events of book 1, Elfin. Elora, her mum and the group that went to rescue Trik have instead become the captured of Lorsan, the dark-elf king. Upon escaping they split into two groups, one goes to the human world, the other to the light-elf castle. Only trouble is that turns out to be a trap leaving portals to the worlds closed with the two groups not being able to get back together.To say much more of what occurs after this would be to ruin yet another fantastic plot by Ms Loftis so all I will say is be prepared for more skeletons falling out of Trik's closet that as this book ends could cause problems (at least that is the way I am envisioning it panning out!), more fantastic witty dialogue that on occasions had me doubled up laughing and of course more drama. Toss hunky possessive male elves into the mix with a dash of crazy elf thrown in for good measure and you are in for a treat!!All I can do now is cross my fingers that we do not have to wait another year for book 3."

2014-04-28,B00HHYN57C,4.0,Forbes does it again,A3HVBS0LY1KRB7,"This is the second novel of Forbes I've read and enjoyed. He maintains a fast pace throughout and creates intriguing characters centered around intelligently designed plots. The story is anything but predictable too, which I enjoyed. Mystery and thrillers are not my typical genre - I prefer adventure & fantasy - but this author will be one I keep tabs on."
2014-06-7,B00HHYN57C,5.0,Brilliant thriller,A2R5TTOZHY3I88,"When you open the pages of a Mason N. Forbes  novel you know you are in the hands of a pro. You may think you know look and feel of determination, but you've never met a man quite like Jamie Strachan. You may think you know about the wealthy and famous, but you've never seen them under an investigation like this.  Clive Patterson a detective launches Jamie on a mole hunt unlike anything in spy fiction, one that takes the reader into the underground of Europe and America and ends up in a landscape of paranoia and betrayal in Islamic nations &#8221;The Strontian Factor&#8221; is a maze of deception and double dealing about a world where everything is written in zeroes and ones and nothing can be trusted. Another brilliant thriller, about deceit, and dishonor. Very entertaining. Highly recommend."

2013-12-29,B00HIBXKQK,4.0,Couldn't put down!!,A1H35RNPTPP9RI,"Review posted at: [...]Rating: 4 starsCarlie never seizes to amaze me with her angst-filled novels, as well as some of her crazy, obsessed characters.  If you've read Carlie's series The Killer Next Door then you'll already be familiar with Natalie and Mac as their best friends to Kate and Neil (the main characters in TKND series).  If you haven't read TKND series, you can still read Beholden to You, you just may feel a little lost at times.  I found myself wanting to slow down Nat & Mac's story because it seemed to be fast paced.  But then I realized that maybe that's what Nat needed, to stop overthinking things because if she had that time I don't think we'd have seen the ending we got.  Nat and Mac both have a fear of abandonment due to both of them having experienced losing their parents and Nat having also lost her sister.  They connect with one another through their shared understanding of grief.  But the connection doesn't stop there as Mac will do anything to protect Nat and keep her safe.  There's also the intense longing they have for one another.  Mac's crazy and obsessed ex makes her entrance and this kept me turning page after page wondering what she was cooking up next.  Does fear overcome Nat? Will she find something to hold on to?  All of this is to be found in her journey.  Give this a try!"

2014-03-20,B00HLA3LKI,4.0,good story,A2UNMDJYXPEQZ3,"This one was a little different for me.  It is the story of a divorced woman with two teen age kids.  She has gone through a lot of things in her life and is being asked to put it into a book.  She is a writer and has a flare for expressing herself.  She seems to have the perfect kids, a great mother, a great guy that wants to marry her, everything!She writes the book.  There is sex implied but no scenes so just about any age could read and enjoy the book.  I would recommend it.  I just have one question, in the interview with Regis and Kelly they close by calling her by the last name of Chase.  Since she is married and has a baby, shouldn't she have been Mrs. Michaels?  Why would she be going by her first marriage last name?  Just wondering.  It was a good story and I enjoyed it.later.....I was told that she went by Chase because that is the name she wrote the book under.  Still seems strange to me to address someone by a pen name rather than their real name but maybe that is the way authors do it.  Just seems strange to me since Chase was her first husband's name."

2014-03-18,B00HNWEA9K,5.0,Fan-freaking-tastic,A3MLBSC1ADBGG4,"How do I begin to write a review for a book that was so wonderful?  I cannot find any words that will do it justice.  Do you know what kind of book I'm talking about?  It's the kind that causes the lump to appear in the back of your throat making it difficult to swallow, the kind of book that makes you get up and pace because you're nervous only to sit back down 10 seconds later because you're dying to know what happens.  JS Cooper delivers a book filed with drama, love, angst, and all the other emotions that I'm still reeling from.In the beginning we are introduced to Hudson and Riley where we learn about the things Hudson did to Riley when they were children.  It's your typical older boy picking on younger girl behavior.  As the story unfolds we learn that Riley is best friends with Eden who happens to be Hudson's younger sister.  Instantly I thought that this was going to be a book where the girl falls in love with the best friend's older brother and best friend gets mad type of book.  Needless to say it didn't go that exact way.  We follow Hudson and Riley through the years. Hudson enrolls in college and Riley is still in High school.  While Riley has a crush on Hudson he has a girlfriend in college.  Since Riley and Eden are friends, Riley still has contact with Hudson and she finds herself on vacation with Hudson.  On the last day of summer vacation as something beautiful is happening a tragedy occurs.  Who is responsible?  Now Hudson and Riley are left to deal with the aftermath.  Riley enrolls in college and decides to write an article for the college newspaper while Hudson is trying to help his girlfriend's mom and the neighbors.  As far would have it, they run into each other again.  Each of them are still holding on to secrets from the past.  Can these two escape the past and be together or will another tragedy end it all?  This book is definitely worth all 5 stars and worth the journey. HAPPY READING!!! Thank you JS Cooper for another amazing book!!!"

Although I do prefer to use the on screen keyboard quite a bit, this has come in very handy for when I need to type out lengthy items.  The response on this is great with little to no lag time and even though it's compact I find it's still comfortable to use for extended periods.  Overall while it is an investment for the price, it's well worth it for the quality."

No one at school knows that she&#8217;d had her heart ripped to shreds by her high school sweetheart, who&#8217;d driven them both off the side of the road on a borrowed motorcycle, and then abandoned her. No one knows the real Rachel Mattson&#8212;except one person&#8230;Ever since he helped nurse his sister&#8217;s feisty best friend back to health, pierced bass player Kai Nakos has been head over heels in love. But the supposed bad boy can&#8217;t risk letting Rachel know the truth&#8212;especially now that the two of them are back in their hometown for the summer, together for the first time since the months following that fateful night. Never mind that Rachel&#8217;s ex is back, groveling for her forgiveness.Shaken by her ex&#8217;s return, Rachel finds herself turning to the one guy she knows she can trust. Kai is willing to hide his feelings for her, just to have Rachel touch him again. After all, this is only a temporary fling. Until it becomes something more. But maybe it had been more all along.My ThoughtsFrom the first time I read the book synopsis this one called to me, the intensity and the sheer thought of finding ones self in Rachel&#8217;s circumstances was a strong hook that I wanted to explore to see how things had turned out for her following her recovery.The very deep feelings that both Kai and Rachel have for each other are apparent to everyone but them from the get go, as they allow themselves to explore their combustible attraction to each other those feelings only grow until they become all consuming.A friends to lovers story that is based on mutual need and yet also has a very solid background in mutual affection and caring, a very compellingly honest look at two people who are trying so hard to come to grips with life and finding it a very bumpy road to overcome mistakes made in their past.Not having read the first two previous books in the series that were the stories for Rachel&#8217;s college friends Avery and Ella it still does not feel like I missed out on anything as this was focused on telling about how Rachel overcame her past and the present situation where she and Kai are finally acting on the chemistry between them.The author used dual POV throughout the book which really helped to establish a better connection with both Kai and Rachel&#8217;s characters as well as showing how each of them worked out their confusion internally as they became more involved with each other.Book 3 of series but it never felt like I missed anything as this was all about Rachel and the pages flew as I devoured her passionate tale! I loved the fact that this had a complete resolution even though there are more books to come, the fact that the ending was solid really helped it to stand on it&#8217;s own without relying on reading the rest of the series.[EArc from Netgalley in exchange for honest review]"
2014-05-20,B00HQLB72Q,4.0,4.5 stars! Loved Kai!,A2MHRBM9MKRNTN,"Rachel's life was destroyed in an instant three years ago. Her whole life changed and she needed time to recover. Then she made her escape to a new life in college. She lost her boyfriend and left her best friends, Dakota and her brother Kai, and Shane. She met new friends Avery and Ella in college, but she did not share her past pain and tried to be a new person. She kept up a facade as a more outgoing flirt with a penchant for jocks. But now she is home again with her old friends and back to being that girl she was before she left.Kai was there for her during the hardest time in her life and developed feelings for his sister's best friend. After they went their separate ways, he tried to forget her, but it was difficult. And now that they are back together for the summer, it is impossible to ignore the feelings he has been carrying around for her. But his life is a mess and he knows he is not good enough. He is rough, tatted, pierced, and loves music. A far cry from the preppy jocks that seem to be her type. And he does not think she feels the same way about him.But as they spend more time together she is remembering how Kai has always been there for her. She begins to start seeing him as more than a friend, but someone she is attracted to that really knows and cares about her. But Rachel is a girl who lost her way. She has put up walls and kept people out. Her personality had undergone changes over the years and she is trying to figure out who she is and where she fits in.It is confusing for both of them navigating between the attraction they are feeling and resolve it with their past friendship. Kai won me over early on. He was so sweet, protective, and had such strong feelings. But he was totally vulnerable, had fears, insecurities, and was afraid to scare her away. He also had a lot of guilt. I loved that in this story, it was the guy who held the torch for years. And she really had no idea how he felt since he had hidden it so well. They both had crutches to help them cope with their issues and the void in their lives.But she has kept secrets from him, her old friends, and new friends. She has to deal with her worlds colliding and coming clean to all involved. She really needs an anchor and to let someone really in. And he needs to find direction for his life. He needs passion and purpose to overcome feeling numb. And their decisions do not only affect themselves but also their whole support system.Their connection was sweet and built on history. I loved how Kai had been there for her in various capacities and really knew how she had changed. Together their sexual tension and chemistry was hot. And his dirty talking was so in contrast to his soft, sweet side. But their communication seemed to be really good in some ways and lacking in others. So they were often confused about the others' intentions. And their lives and goals were not always compatible.Can they overcome all of the obstacles, open up, and make it more than just a summer secret fling?This is the first book I have read in this series, but I had no trouble reading it as a stand alone. I enjoyed her friends from college, Avery and Ella, even though I have not read their books in this series(but now I want to). And I liked their best friends Shane and Dakota. I would to see their full story in another book. There also seemed to be a little tease with his cousin Nate and a girl named Jessie.I really liked Christina Lee's writing style. It flowed well, sucked me in, and kept me enthralled in their story. It was told in both points of view which was very important due to their confusion and hidden feelings. The characters were complex and well developed. The plot line was interesting. Overall it was an engaging story about friendship, love, and finding your own way. It was funny, sexy, sweet, and Kai was totally swoonworthy.I was gifted a copy in exchange for an honest review."

2014-05-17,B00HTJH9J0,4.0,4.5 Stars,A1AYACY5KT0YOG,"I have thoroughly enjoyed this series by Rachel Harris.  The first book was really cute and sweet and I loved Cat and Lorenzo, and were briefly introduced to Lucas.  The second book, A Tale of Two Centuries was Alessandra and Austin's story and I enjoyed it even more than the first.  We got to see a bit of Lucas and Cat in that book also, but we really get to know Lucas in My Not So Super Sweet Life, and I totally fell in love with him.  Where as the first two books were more light and fun, this book is more on the serious side, and OMG - the romance factor is turned up into the read/heated zone big time.  I loved it!!Cat just wants to have a normal life, but with her parents both being in Hollywood, her dad's upcoming marriage, and a stunt her mom pulls, Cat has some serious issues she has to deal with in this book, and she doesn't always handle things in the best manner.  Lucas also has his own problems he is dealing with related to his family and what's expect of him.  Lucas is so romantic and totally swoon-worthy, and is also very protective of what's his, namely Cat.  He really outdoes himself in the boyfriend department and I would love to just pull him out of the book and keep him for myself.  He truly is a modern day Prince Charming.  We are also introduced to a new character, Ransom, and well.....I hope we get to see more of him.My Not So Super Sweet Life is a wonderful addition to this adorably sweet, fun, and swoony series that YA romance fans will love.  The story is captivating, the characters are beautifully done, and Rachel Harris has once again proved what a talented and creative author she is."
2014-01-28,B00HTX433G,5.0,I can do this!,AV9D6ND2C68BR,Before I got this book I knew nothing about greenhouses but my girlfriend really wants one for her flowers and plants. This book gave me all the information I needed and it laid out all of my options for me. The author introduced me to the idea of greenhouse kits! I didn't even know about them but I think that's the option I'm going to go with. There is also a nice chapter in here about heating and cooling systems. My girlfriend is going to be so thrilled when I tell her I can actually do this. Great resource.

2014-04-1,B00HV2DE7G,4.0,Great story!,A2MUYZCYMA2FJ6,"Beached is the story is the second installment for Ros Baxter&#8217;s Aegira Chronicles and follows the journey of Princess Lecanora to save her kingdom of Aegira.Aegira, for those of you who have read book one (Fish Out of Water), is based on a Norse myth and sets this story up in an mythical and whimsical type of aura that can&#8217;t help but automatically pique your interest!But when you mix that with a little love, mystery, suspense, some magic, and a handsome mercenary from the Land&#8230;how will this all turn out?  And when this ensues the clashing of two worlds, how far will Lecanora go to prevent all chaos from taking place?So, my thoughts:  I really liked this book, I did.  But it did have a few snags as well.While I do love me a mermaid read, there was something missing in it.  For me, I just felt disconnected from the plot and the writing.  It just didn&#8217;t pull me in as much as book one did with the character being a strong, snarky, and opinionated female.  Maybe that&#8217;s just a preference of mine: strong protagonist leads instead of whiny, oblivious, and completely nave characters.I&#8217;m not saying that the temperament of Lecanora annoyed me.  She didn&#8217;t.  She was just too innocent for my taste is all.  But, I guess that&#8217;s the diversity that Ms. Baxter brings as Rania and Lecanora are polar opposites and bring something new to each plot development.  How refreshing of her!So over all,  a nice splash of salt water for me filled with intrigue, conspiracy, and a young girl gathering her strength and digging deep within herself to prove to herself and others that she has what it takes to save her beloved sea home."

2014-02-5,B00HYQJPC2,5.0,Loved it.,A1X7TL7F1IEKRJ,First of all I was a little hesitant in purchasing due to the length. Don't get me wrong I want more books 900 plus pages but it needs to keep me hooked.  This did not let me down...fell in love with Ris or as Dex called her Ritz.  Shy and unsure of herself who wears her heart on her sleeve..... Then you have Dex the d**k. So loved her name for Dex. Alpha moody male...great combo.. Can not wait for more from this author...

2014-02-9,B00HZ6CJVA,5.0,Loved it - thrilling and sexy,AKGNEU8DB2VVR,"I'm so glad I took the chance on this book. By far one of the best I've read. The heroine was so passionate about her beliefs and her students. While some of her decisions were crazy, I lived her. The hero was the stuff dreams are made of. I kind of suspected that his sister was &#34;Linda&#34; and my heart broke for for the hero. Highly recommend without reservation."
2014-06-16,B00HZVQCWM,4.0,"3.5 stars for this contemporary, urban fantasy, M/M romance.",A2GE4E4CWEQNT2,"I received a copy of this book via Goodreads Don't Buy My Love program in exchange for an honest review.Quentin is a 19 y/o man living in a cottage outside Nottingham. He is independently wealthy on account of his father abandoning him and his mother 6 years prior--without saying goodbye and while also removing all traces of his existence from their lives--and setting a trashbag filled with half a million pounds on Quentin's bed.Quentin is gay and his BFF Bertie is a lesbian. They occasionally co-habitate. They definitely drink to excess. On New Year's Quentin is nearly killed by a drunk driver, but he is rescued by a mysterious stranger who pushes him out of the vehicle's path. This stranger has brilliant green eyes and shows up again at the hospital at odd times without speaking to Quentin.Bertie and Quentin's mother believe he's hallucinating the mysterious stranger. After what seems the absolute longest invalid recovery from a broken ankle in the modern medical era, Quentin goes out drinking with Bertie again. And again encounters the stranger. This time they speak.Turns out Tyrin is gay, and a stalker-first class. And, he's not quite human. I'm not going to reveal his powers, but from the title one should guess he's Atlantean. He is charged with finding defector Atlanteans and their half-breed children. Turns out Quentin is more than a passing interest--but Tyrin's brother is all about revealing Quentin's issues to the Atlantean community, thereby banishing Quentin to Atlantis. While this would satisfy Tyrin's sexual interest, it would mean cutting Quentin off from his loved ones...forever.The book ends with a cliffhanger where Tyrin's brother orchestrates a commotion injuring Bertie...and forcing Quentin to choose between her health and his Earth existence.The book is a bit of a slow starter with information dumping in the outset. It was clear to me the issue with Quentin's father from the second he was mentioned. The magic of Atlanteans was interesting--I liked that they all didn't have superpowers--or the same powers. Tyrin is an interesting character; I wish he hadn't come off so creepy. As for smexytimes, that's between them, alas, we get only a couple of smooches and steamy looks with teasing hints about what great times they had.It took me a bit of time to warm up to Quentin--he's a bit on the immature side. I liked him and Bertie, they are a fun platonic pair, but the boozing got a bit much. What's with all the puking and passing out? Really.The book could have used another edit to remove the punctuation errors and homonym switches."

The attraction between the two is undeniable but both try to fight against it. Lilly's plan is to torture and give him the worst case of blueballs in his life. Nate's plan is to try and keep it in his pants all the while pissing her off.Nate is struggling with survivors remorse from his last tour, and guilt over leaving his ailing mother behind and his little brother to care for her. Lilly struggles against her past of a bad family and always being left behind. Lilly and Nate try to push each other away but when they give into temptation more is on the line than just pride.The Good: The story was pretty damn perfect. Even my cold and perverted heart cracked a little with this one. You'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll get more than a little hot and bothered. The struggles of the characters as they fight against the past to get to something more was truly touching. The heroine is sassy and sexy but still sweet and has such heart.The Bad: Not a god damn single thing. Even the ending was perfect. My heart is not as pervy and stone cold as I thought.Final Note: Totally worth reading. So many romance novel just seem to blend together and follow the same plot line. This novel just adds something more. More heart, more story, more sexy. Although this is the second novel in the Falling for You series you can read it as a stand alone. I still have not read the first, but will definitely be doing so in the near future. This was the first book in a while that I could not stand to put down.Favorite Quotes:&#34;And there was no way she could go to prison. She looked terrible in orange. Guess she'd have to get creative when hiding the body.&#34;&#34; 'We even brought a skunk home one time, thinking if we gave it a bath it wouldn't stink so badly.' Nate chocked on his drink, but he was grinning. 'Why in God's name would you do that?' She shrugged. 'Poor thing looked so lonely sitting on the side of the road all by himself.' &#34;&#34;Shock and awe stole any words he might have produced.&#34;"

2014-01-29,B00I2W94IW,5.0,Almost Perfect!,A1FJ6YD0TL90GN,"I needed this book as soon as I finished book 1. And I began reading it and could not put it down. Had to drag myself away to do my work. An almost perfect story. A few months after Liz leaves London and  Gabriel, she is alone and pregnant. Still independent and working towards her degree and still working full time. When she has to see Gabriel to sign the final paperwork, he doesn't seem to know her. She is heart broken. He is in pain from the accident and it shows on his face, at least to her. What will happen when work finds out who the father of her baby is? What does Gabriel have up his sleeve for Liz and her baby? Will Gabriel learn to accept her independence or lose her in the end? Will Liz follow Gabriel's rules? There are some twists to this one that I was not expecting but loved them all. Yes there is a cliffhanger but the story is well worth the read. Wait for the last book if you want, then read them all together. Either way, you will not be able to put your kindle, nook or other reading device down. Great job once again Magda Alexander and can't wait for book 3."

I haven't read Clay/Jet's story yet but I have read the other three.  I didn't write a review for Ethan's book because I still don't think much of his character.  Jade put forth a good effort to redeem Ethan but as far as I am concerned his character was weak.Anyway back to Brad - I love Brad's character.  So sad what he had to endure and once again, as I reviewed in Bullet Val was such an idiot to not see how much Brad love her throughout.  Although reading Fully Automatic was much like re-reading Bullet it was different in that we were reading Brad's POV.  We know that while he was discreet he didn't just sit back without his own affairs.Good job to Jade.  Very realistic in that although filled with angst the stories are realistic and heart wrenching at times."
2014-05-10,B00I481HSO,4.0,I'm intrigued.,A3VETQ4MCUBHB7,"I like Ms. Wright's writing.  She has a way with words that pulls you into her story and won't let you go. For example: &#34;Noc, claimed he was a spoken word artist, but he was actually just a skinny Puerto Rican guy who sold drugs and wrote lyrical rhymes that would cause Dr. Seuss to rise from his grave and slap him.&#34;She also makes me laugh out loud which not enough books do frankly.  I will be eternally grateful to her for sharing the V.I.B test as well as the meaning behind it (if you wanna know read the book). Her characterizations are well thought out, fun, and the protagonists as well as some other characters seemed to leap off the page and announce themselves occasionally as here for a good time. I even loved how she sensually used food throughout the story.So why four stars you ask?Again for me it's a matter of opinion and personal likes (oh alright it's a personal quirk).  I have a problem with polygamous relationships. I just don't get it and not being a prude or being open minded (both of which I am) hasn't helped me to change my mind. I've read many books about them and I still feel woefully confused and behind the eight ball on the subject.It was particularly difficult for me in this book cause I liked Jasmine. She seemed like a smart, interesting woman who would not put up with the crap Chase Stone put out (I don't care how fine or rich or sexy, or... did I mention he was really rich?).  And as for his other women, I kept wishing for female characters in other books who are tougher than me to come over and put a nice case of whip a$$ on them. They needed it.  Believe me.Alright I'll get off my peevish soapbox and get to the important point.  Like many others I read this book because my book club strongly suggested it and it is not only worth the read, I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. I would recommend it as a fun read that will challenge your social mores. Life's a bore without some challenges so I'll be reading book 2."

I usually feel cheated by authors writing 100 page stories and luring me into what amounts to a reader's one night stand.  However,  the premise of this story was orchestrated brilliantly and perfectly.  A chance meeting on a plane, a snow storm and a woman at a crossroads in her life makes for a perfect romantic interlude!"

2014-05-28,B00I7EOX68,2.0,The Silent Reporter,A21Q18JIMSWIFA,This seems like &agrave; lot of clich&eacute;s. The detective has become an alcoholic because his pregnant wife died in a car accident. The young man is &agrave; reporter but not really working for the paper. A man commits suicide but not really. I found the characters one deminsional. This story is like so many others I have read. I am guessing if you want something to read that you don't have to get interested in this would do it.
2014-02-8,B00I7EUDHQ,1.0,Reads like an advertisement with external links,A3EPHBMU07LZ50,"Feb 9: NOTE the authors commented the term Little Aussie Gluten Flour will be removed by February 11 when their cookbook is updated. The external link to their proprietary pie crust recipe is included as a convenience, according to one of the authors. Below is the original review.I downloaded the Allergy Friendly Eats: A Collection of The Little Aussie Bakery & Cafe's Most Popular Gluten-Free & Allergy Friendly Recipes cookbook by authors Rita Sturzbecher and John Apostolovic and was a bit disappointed to find the authors included external links to their website to get recipes. I do believe if I pay for a cookbook it should contain all the recipes needed to prepare a dish. I should not have to depend on Internet access to complete a recipe. Also, their cookbook lacks an interactive table of contents making it a bit more difficult to find the recipes you would like to prepare.Also, some of the recipes call for proprietary ingredients such as Little Aussie GF Flour.I do like how the authors stated all the recipes are gluten free and are free of the top 10 allergens unless otherwise noted. You will read an index of recipes and there are notations stating if there is a possible allergy ingredient used to prepare the recipe. You will find numerous color photos showing completed recipes.Some of the recipes you will find in their cookbook include:Spinach Quiche with the notation ""Contains dairy."" This recipe uses Little Aussie GF Flour and includes an external link for the pie crust recipe needed to make the quiche.Mini Chorizo French Toast (You will need to purchase the Little Aussie GF buns to complete the recipe).Creamy Rice PuddingAlmond Tea Cake (Recipe says contains the notation ""Contains eggs and almonds."" (You will need to purchase the Little Aussie GF flour to complete the recipe).Dairy-Free Garlic ""Butter""Australian Lamb Pie (You will need to buy and pick up the pie crust from the Little Aussie Bakery or make the pie crust by finding their recipe online using an external link).Ox Blood Chocolate Cake with the notation ""Contains eggs."" (You will have to purchase the Little Aussie GF flour to complete the recipe. There is a link to the Little Aussie Bakery & Cafe to purchase the flour).As you can see this cookbook reads more like an advert than a true stand alone cookbook. You will need to use the enclosed cookbook links to find the extra recipes or ingredients you need to prepare the recipes.Note: I suffer from potentially life threatening allergies, so I am always on the lookout for good allergy recipes, and cookbooks. I wish their cookbook had been what I had hoped for.Recommend with caveats given.MR"

2014-03-28,B00I91EQCA,2.0,Don't bother,A2G8DRR5WT0QN2,"Maybe it is just because I just finished an incredibly well written book that I struggled so much with this one.  Nah, I just think this is an immaturely written, boring book.  The main character, Jette, is ridiculously immature-especially so because she supposedly comes from a foster child background with little to no stability, but somehow afforded culinary school as an out-of-state student.  She is self sabotaging and way too much drama. The book actually lets us know when Jetter checks her Facebook and Twitter feeds.  Seriously?  The writing is overly descriptive, also.  It starts out as a love story to the Jersey Shore, as if I care about the minute details.  I suppose that establishes the author's &#34;local&#34; Jersey credentials.  When there are SO MANY good books out there, don't waster your time on this one."

Very well written. The premise is undoubtedly one of the best good vs. evil stories written. The drama and action that takes place throughout kept me glued to the pages. The characters are a great cast of personalities. I admit that I did not see the end unfolding the way it did. Azure has such a talented way of writing her stories. As always I was not let down. A definite add to your tbr list. Highly recommended!!
2014-02-14,B00IFTZAEE,5.0,Fantastic!,A19A83SNJZYJCB,"I've been following this series and when I saw the prequel was coming out, I was excited. I had to have it! This story gets deeper into the history of the two guardian angels and we find out why they began feuding over one human girl. I wasn't sure what the author had in mind for this story, boy does it sizzle. It was even hotter than Ominous Love. Although the story starts out with Eloise's birth, it jumps halfway through to when she's sixteen. The story is romantic, but also funny and there are plenty of laugh out loud moments. It's also sad in parts and will bring tears to your eyes. The first book was written from Eloise's point of view, but this story is written from the male's point of view, which was great. All through this story, the reader will be right inside the MC's mind, through his suffering, his learning and his discovery of what human teenage hormones feel like, and the problems they can cause. I loved getting this extra history and fell in love with the characters all over again as I anxiously turned the pages. I also loved that this book was set in Australia and Australian native animals pop up in a few scenes,. You get to travel along sun-drenched beaches, fly through dense forests, even see a shooting star from close up. It took you right into the setting. That scene was so amazing and visual, but my favorite part was when the angel fell. I can't say what happens though because it would give the plot away. This book was an awesome read and I can't wait to read Ominous Angel, the third book in this series."
2014-02-14,B00IFW5W5I,5.0,Loved it,A1I7WIH41YDFDJ,"The only thing I was disappointed in this book is that it was too short.I always wonder what happens with characters in romance novels years later and Shelly Crane managed to wow me with her writing by fulfilling the ""whatever happened to them"" questions that I had with this series. I missed the significance series so much and was not let down and now being promised with the continuation of Ava's story. I can't wait! Thank you Shelly Crane for bringing them back!"

2014-03-4,B00IM4RLQC,5.0,Another wonderful story from Susan Mac Nicol,A1G7LEBVXSWFXD,"After only reading 3 books from Ms. Mac Nicol she has jumped to my must buy list.  So glad I found her books.  Toby is a man who has found his calling & loves his work as the GM of a hotel in Stamford.  When he meets Rain, a Master Carpenter who's been hired to build a bar in the hotel sparks instantly fly.  There is a wonderful chemistry between the leading men that just draws you in, I found myself instantly falling in love and cheering for them to make their relationship work.  I don't want to give any details away form this great story because I want you to watch it unfold for yourself. While there is drama there is not the angst that is in 'Saving Alexander' or 'Worth Keeping' (both also excellent stories) there is plenty of humor with an unlikely phobia and an unexpected talent for pole dancing. This is a book I will be rereading again & again. I can't wait for Ms. Mac Nicol's next book."

Lewis tries to distance himself from Max. By the time Max decides he wants more than friendship with Lewis, will it be too late?I loved this book. These guys were awesome together. They had such great chemistry and a good connection. I loved all the other roommates as well. Lewis and Max, just fit well together. I was sad to see their story end. My only complaint is I wanted more scenes of them as a couple. Maybe the author will write a novella for them. Fingers crossed ;)This is my 1st book by this author, but it won't be my last.

The ins and outs of the Law of Attraction and why it works for some people but not for others has always been a mystery to me, and this book explains a lot of why I was confused.In addition to explaining how the Law of Attraction truly works, this book is truly motivational. I now understand how I can visualize my best future and success, and I'm excited about getting start and each moment that happens beyond this one, because I know that every step into the future is a step closer to my new reality."
2014-05-8,B00IODZCDK,3.0,Strong writing but couldn't connect,ABKPMQWQM01II,"**Originally written for Book Bliss book blog. I received a copy of this book in exchange for an unbiased and honest review**Review: 3 starsGeneral: Then There Was You is a good little romance read. For me, it had many strong elements from a strong set of characters to a mostly compelling plot. The cover too, was a good hook into it. I thought the writing itself was high quality and the words easy to read. Salem and Chris were wonderful, well written characters with a story that was both believable and emotional.However for me I just didn't click with the book all the way. There was something about it that kept me from having that hard to put down response. I certainly enjoyed it from beginning to end but it wasn't engaging enough personally. I think the issue may have been the point of view. Since becoming a book blogger I have learned that there are multiple points of view that can work, however I still prefer the third person when dealing with an emotional and impactful story. This book didn't reach out and grab me despite the extremely strong characters. I almost feel it's a disservice to people reading this that I can't put my finger on why I enjoyed it but didn't love it. However, sometimes we just don't find that connection with a book and there's nothing wrong with it, it just isn't jiving with you."

I really enjoy this author's style. It's not heavy going or overly-violent and again I have been drawn into the plot. There's a surprise twist to the plot which means of course I need to get the next book in the series to satisfy my curiosity. Always a good sign.

2014-03-18,B00ISB70TM,5.0,Sweet Little Book for Under 5's,ATWKJ3MGJU3KJ,"Although I don't have children I do have a lot of friends with young children. Therefore this little book intrigued me. It is a simple book but is great for under 3's and I would say probably for older children but in a different ways. Younger children will love the bright pictures and will want to look at these. It will also introduce them to the concept of time at an early age.With older children I would develop the basic premise. As well as talking about time I would also ask them what they did at each place. What did Carmi the Cat do with each of the animals he visited. In this way older children could also develop their ability to tell stories. At the back there are two pages of activities. Obviously this is one for the paperback, rather than the kindle version. You could, however, recreate your own.I love this little book. It is more suitable to be read on a tablet rather than a basic kindle as the beautifully coloured pictures would be lost in black and white. This is a book I would highly recommend to all parents of young children."

2014-03-27,B00IW3BOC0,5.0,absolute perfection,A30QPWHVHGEBR0,"I fell in love with this series and its main characters, Tate and Sav.  I am now heartbroken now that the series has ended.  But what a magnificent ride it has been.  Rachel Brookes has brought to life these incredible characters that you can&#8217;t help but love and adore. In this finale to the series, Tate and Sav have everything that they could ever want: love and a family.  Their lives are the living embodiment of bliss but both live under the constant fear of losing the other.  When problems arise, will their love be enough to get them through?This series is perfection.  Absolute perfection. Rachel&#8217;s voice has become stronger, lovelier and more concise as this series has progressed.  Her words draw you into the story and do not let you go.  I became so wrapped up in Breathe Again that it became nearly impossible to put it down.  These characters will play with your emotions.  I was a hot mess of laughter, tears and love throughout this book. Tate is beyond hunk-a-licious.  He could alternate between adorable, sexy and maddening, but so lovable.  Sav is one strong, opinionated but not afraid to show her emotions and stand up to Tate.  I love the fact that she stands up for herself but also has an air of innocence about her.  Tate and Sav are one of my all time book couples. They are sweet, sexy, and lovable.Now to what I didn&#8217;t like- CHELSEA.  Ugh.  If I never have to read about her again , it will be too soon.  It literally hurt my heart to have to watch and see if Tate and Sav could move on from her lies.  I was beyond tense while waiting to see if this amazing couple would finally get their happy ending.  Speaking of the ending&#8230;it was perfect.  There was no other way that I would have wanted this series to end.  Kudos to Rachel Brookes.  Her writing had me addicted to the very last word.  This series is addictive, emotional, intense, dramatic, sexy, and fun.  As sad as I am that it had to end, I am so beyond honored that I was given the opportunity to read these exceptional books.5 out of 5 stars to every book in the series."
2014-05-8,B00IW876FY,5.0,Great Prayer Book,A3EM163GU8FDPV,This is a great book to have on hand.  Especially if you have not prayed in a while or are not sure of how to pray.  This book delivers a few awesome prayers.
2014-03-12,B00IW8ADMW,3.0,Didn't Meet My Expectations,A3OYOY6OVT8VSF,"This was an okay book... but it was nowhere near as gritty and heart-wrenching as I'd expected it to be. Definitely didn't meet my expectations. *sad face*3 STARS FOR ANNIE & PATRICK!Young, beautiful, rich, American girl, Annie, was kidnapped from her Carribean cruise five years ago and forced into an underworld of sex slavery and drug addiction.Patrick Walsh is a Navy SEAL. On a night off he visits a brothel and when he chooses Annie from a line up of hookers, she recognises it as her final chance to be rescued, so she risks everything and tells him her name, in the hope that he will save her.&#34;My name is Annie Hamilton. I'm an American citizen. I was kidnapped from a cruise ship five years ago. You're my last hope. Please save me.&#34;Never a man to walk away from somebody in need, or from a challenge, Patrick can't help but return to Annie, despite the trouble it could cause for him, in an attempt to return her safely to her parents in America, who had all but given up hope of ever seeing her again.'They had once been little girls playing make believe, dreaming of princes and castles. But I was no prince. I'd done enough life saving in my time and I'd learned the hard way that I couldn't save them all.'Now, I was so excited to read this book. It isn't often that a book can totally grip me from a blurb alone. Usually it's the hype surrounding the book, the recommendations through word of mouth, reviews from trusted sources, etc. But with this book, I read the book and I had to read it as soon as I could get hold of it. And I have to admit, I was pretty disappointed.This could have been sooooo good. This could have completely blown my mind, broken my heart, made my pulse race, made me cry, filled me with adrenaline and made a huge mark on this indie romance community. But it didn't. It was short, quick, a bit rushed and just not nearly as hard-hitting as I wanted it to be. Everything was wrapped up pretty swiftly, there were no big climaxes, no complications to navigate... Find girl, save girl, bring girl home, get together with girl, the end. It just kind of fell a little flat, really.Invincible is told from Patrick's POV. Now, one thing that I felt this book could have really benefited from was some scenes from Annie's POV. How great would that have been? To get inside her head, see what she'd been through. I wanted to be shocked and horrified. I wanted to be as desperate for her liberation as she was. But as we didn't really get to know Annie until she free, I really wasn't too fussed either way. She was just a statistic to me, albeit one that gives really good head and has an alien tattoo on her ankle. Not really grounds for heartfelt emotional investment in a character.&#34;For five years, I've head on to this fantasy that I'd be rescued. I prayed for you, I've dreamt of you. I just knew you were sent for me. You are my only hope.&#34;And then, once she was free, (which actually seemed like a pretty painless rescue mission to me... although I'm no expert on rescue missions, so y'know, I could be wrong) I really felt she got over the whole ordeal rather too quickly. Here is a girl who has been sold as a sex slave, passed from place to place, raped and violated repeatedly, been forced to engage in all kinds of unmentionable, unimaginable things at the hands of the absolute scum of society. She's been forcedly addicted to heroine, using the drugs to numb her pain and as the only form of release, she's lost the only friend she had whilst in captivity, lived in complete squalor, stripped of her identity... I mean, she's been in the epitome of living hell for five years. I'd imagine it is virtually impossible to fully recover from this kind of experience. And Annie kind of just slips back into society quite neatly, with the exception of some cold-turkey induced tantrums whilst she detoxes. I just felt like it would have been really fascinating if the author had explored the huge obstacles Annie had to face when returning back to America after such a traumatic ordeal. But she didn't.&#34;You aren't invisible - you're invincible.&#34;Again, this was just one way that this book felt far too rushed. And then there was the ending which really took the biscuit... *looks shocked* I just felt like the author got a bit bored with writing and just went 'Ah, that'll do.' For me, it wasn't a satisfactory ending at all. Things with Annie and Pat moved waaaay too quickly, completely unrealistically, again there was no real climax and then... bish, bosh bash, The End. Ta daaaa. *jazz hands*Erm, no. I wanted to get to know and love these characters. I'm reading this book because I want to know their story. I don't want a bullet point rendition of what happened to them. I want to know it all!Patrick was okay. He was a bit up his own arse, though. He was very full of the whole 'I'm a Navy SEAL and we are the s***!' thing. He had commitment issues, trust issues, etc. at first, but then just completely forgot they even existed once the author decided she'd had enough of those. But overall, he was a good enough guy and he was pretty adept at saving his damsel in distress, although the guys guarding her didn't exactly seem up to the job. But then, didn't you know, SEALs are awesome badasses who can conquer anything and anyone... so maybe that's why. Who knows?!'In times of war or uncertainty there is a special breed of warrior ready to answer our Nation's call.A common man with uncommon desire to succeed.Forged by adversity, he stands alongside America's finest special operations forces to serve his country, the American people, and protect their way of life.I am that man.'So, what there was of this book was okay. Could have been better, but it was alright. But there wasn't near enough character development, detail, action... anything really. The premise is fantastic, I so wanted to love this book. I thought it was going to rock my socks off! But the execution left so much to be desired in my opinion. I feel like I want to go to the author and go, great, now fill in the gaps and tell me the rest! What a shame.Have you read it? Tell us what you thought?'Invincible' Statistics&#8226; Steam Rating (out of 5): &#9829;&#9829;&#9829;&#8226; Ending: Happy ending, but very abrupt.&#8226; Length: 157 pages&#8226; POV: Patrick's POV.&#8226; Narrative: First person.

2014-04-8,B00IX4ET2A,5.0,Great book!!,A1ADRRKARO0DKB,"I have to say wow when it comes to this book. When I begun to read the book, I imagined a young girl lost in a world of faint memories. The more I read the book the more exciting it became. The book has an interesting plot to the story that brings in a hint of horror and excitement at the same time. As I kept reading I found myself wondering how the book would end and if anyone would lose their life or if she would choose between two friends that loved her. This is a great book filled with action, exotic temptations and thrills. I really enjoyed reading the book. I hope to see more books from this author. Maybe even a second series of this book, which I think could be very easily made. The author did an excellent job writing the book. I recommend this book to anyone looking for a thriller with some exotic excitement added to it."
2014-04-23,B00IXOP294,4.0,a great romantic escape,A1B8VC3YYINAVX,"While I don't read a ton of Regency Romance, I so enjoyed reading this book. It was a great romantic escape. It had all the things I love in a romance: unexpected and twisting plots, detente and intrigue, romance and of course, a sexy hero. It took a long time for Lady Henrietta and Lord Vaughan to find their happy ending. I liked the primary characters. Henrietta was spunky and intelligent, a trait I often find lacking in stories with women of this time period.  I was fully prepared to dislike Vaughan due to the fact that he had a mistress but I just could not keep from liking him - I do love a good bad boy. ;)I enjoyed Ms. Walters easy to read pacing, the clarity of her plot and the individuality of her characters.  While I have not read A Lady's Plight, the first book in this series, I did not feel like I was walking in in the middle of the conversation.  This book stood well on it's own.  However, I do love a good series and I certainly look forward to reading more Katy Walter romances in the future.Rating:  4 Stars****I received this book in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  All opinions are my own and no further compensation was received."

They must learn to live with the past, almost a decade, 8 years in fact since the beginning, in this new world and figure out whether they should good or bad. There are a lot of moral situations in this story and had it not been for all the retelling of many details I would have given this 5 stars but sometimes it is just too much. I truly did enjoy this book it was different than a lot of post-apocalyptic tales I have read it comes with a lot of twist and turns. I really want to know what happens in the next book but for now I need to go back a bit and read the first book in this series! This book is a tale of its own and as you can see can be read without having read the first."

2014-04-17,B00J2LH1JG,5.0,Made Me Think of Things I Otherwise Wouldn't,AP3L1D6WOQPVG,"On my continued journey learning to trade I came across another one in the series on Day Trading which is something I didn&#8217;t know too much about prior to reading this book.  I have had some friends that have had some success in this field working from home and working for themselves and they seemed pretty happy with their lifestyle. Knowing the high risks involved with day trading I wanted to gather some additional information than what I had gotten from my friends.  I really liked how the book didn&#8217;t just explain about the dynamics and fundamentals of day trading but went into detail about how your home office should look and feel so that it puts you in the best mind set, minimizes the stress, and is free of distraction as well as the importance of writing a business plan and how to do it for your day trading business. Just because Day Trading is the most standard type of self-employed business you need to treat it like any other business and business venture. As I am learning from the few books I&#8217;ve been reading about trading practicing is the most important thing and day trading is no different. The book described how you can practice with trade simulators which allows you to practice in real time without the money and risk and from these platforms results should be analyzed and learned from it by developing a strategy that works for you and sticking with it. Another interesting point that was made in this book is that not all day trading is high risk such as with market making which will be something I will look more into since I&#8217;m not a super highly risky person. I&#8217;m really glad I read this book. Though I will be continuing my journey learning about day trading I definitely found this as a a great start."
2014-05-25,B00J44T4YQ,1.0,this was just so bad,AP5EQBCE6FW0V,"I hate these books about men who try to rescue girls who were kidnapped and pushed into slavery.The relationships that developed aren't real.  They're based to Stockholm Syndrome which isn't sexy.  Even if I'm supposed to ignore this in dark romance, there's not enough here for me to buy the relationship that supposedly develops.SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT FORWARD.There were plenty of plot and content issues that never get properly resolved here.  This is a standalone, so there will never be resolution on these issues for me.  Will the relationship between William and his twin, Ben ever be repaired?  The ending makes no real sense -- all 12 go back to him, even though they know that #13 and William are &#34;together&#34;  And did she really have to be a virgin??  **ROLLS EYES**The author makes a big deal at the end about the girls finally meeting each other and learning their names and backgrounds... when really we should be learning about how they might cope outside of William's &#34;care&#34;... and what of the bullies that permanently disfigured William?  What happened?  That he wants to &#34;teach lessons&#34; presumes that these girls are &#34;bad&#34; when in actuality they were thrust into situations that were out of their control.  It makes no sense!"

Some of the description of weapons and home front preps reminded my of John Wesley Rawles' first novel. If you're not interested in those detailed descriptions you can skip ahead, but they include some great ideas (particularly fire thorns under your windows). I disagree that with the reviewers who said it was too short. I thought it was very well done, and I'm definitely looking forward to the next book in the series."

This book shines a light on what I've been doing for quite a while already. It seems that a lot of people go through life like they're just going through the motions, and as a result they can become very frustrated and are not able to put their finger on exactly what it is that is bothering them. This book describes how to practice mindfulness, with the hope of making self realisations and being able to look at things for what they are without getting overly stressed or worried."
2014-04-1,B00JBTNJIG,5.0,Good Read,A1K9Z3AAKDQ8UT,"Sunny you know you did your thing girl, I love reading your books they keep getting better and better, Keep up the good work, I can't wait to read what you have coming out next."

2014-04-11,B00JD5RM54,5.0,Everything you need to get starrted,A2HK3Q07JRCIGJ,"The Mediterranean Diet has been been around for many years and is still very popular. That must mean that it works and that it is a diet/lifestyle that one can stick to and not feel deprived.This book does a good job of providing a background on the diet from it's development to what it includes and why it is included. You also gain an understanding of what it isn't. There is a section on myths of the Mediterranean Diet which help you to understand it even further.The recipes look delicious and I will be experimenting with a few of them this weekend. Each recipe includes Prep Time, Cooking time, Serving and Nutritional information. If you want to try something different and something that is not difficult to stick with this book is a great place to start or get more recipes if you are already on the Mediterranean Diet."
2014-04-14,B00JDV9MGK,5.0,Great info!,A2WZJDFX12QXKD,"I love books that are thorough but concise, not wasting pages on excessive verbiage. Every page in this book is useful and important, and it covers everything: the biology of our skin, how acne happens, how various molecules from our food interact to cause it, and finally a laundry list of which foods to avoid and which to focus on. Highly recommended."
2014-04-15,B00JDWVHOY,3.0,greed,A1I4NFFM9HCIXB,"i enjoyed the book  , it was a page turner for sure !  Greed is something else !!  it just lacked depth  in meaning  i think they should have went in more detail about  the main characters but like i said a good book"
2014-04-26,B00JDYC5OI,3.0,Over too soon,A2AYH9TNEAGGUS,I was just starting to get into the story and it was over. I hope I dont have to wait to long for the next one or it want be worth reading this series. Love both the characters of this story and hope the next book continues to develop them while keeping the interesting topic of this book flowing.
2014-05-19,B00JDZJKG8,3.0,Rather Interesting.,AJDJXHL159RQ0,"Rather Interesting.I don't know if I'd give it any more stars than this, but I do lick itVery nice."
2014-05-24,B00JF6PCB2,3.0,good,A2KEX55F9H5K8R,it ended as if there is a sequel but i have yet to see a second installment over all the book is a good book but the ending leaves to many unanswered questions either that or use your deductive reasoning to determine what happened
2014-04-29,B00JF9HC6W,4.0,Enjoyable,AV5QDABZ3T6K1,First thought...this book just made me feel good reading it....it was one of those light reads but very well done. If your looking for a happy ending you'll find one here.
2014-04-2,B00JFGHXPU,5.0,Damian has been tamed &lt;3,A2NX71QYBESHTK,"What can I say, I LOVED The Heartbreaker series. Damian Castillo is definitely a man every woman wants to have as her own. The first book we get to see how Damian meets alexis and the time they spend together. Then we get the prequel and we get to see just how much of a bad boy he really is! sigh I'll never look at washer machines the same ;)""You are the butter to my bread and the breath to my life""-Julia Child (From Julie and Julia)Okay so Taming Damian.. wow what a roller coaster of emotions, not only in the book lol.. Some times I felt like crying my eyes out, other I just wanted to punch my screen, and other i wanted to get in between the words and give them a good shake or punch. But that epilogue made it all worth it, it was damn beautiful made me all cheesy with tears in my eyes, it was beautifully written. Jessica Wood did an amazing job writing this book. If you read the first book and liked it, you're going to love this one. There of course DRAMA, unexpected events, people from the past, moments that will anger you, moments that will make you cry but its all worth it &lt;3I don't want to say too much and ruin it for other readers. I read it all in one day and now I kinda wish I didn't I'm really going to miss Alexis, Damian and Izzy! &lt;3**Book does have a happy ending and its the conclusion to the Heartbreaker seriesIf you haven't read any of Jessica Wood's books then go now! :) you'll love it! I sure did :D"
2014-07-18,B00JFGHXPU,4.0,It was ok. R. A,A1AHCX8ONTKNSG,It was ok for the continuing from the first book. It was good that she added the cancer part it made them a stronger couple.
2014-04-3,B00JFHDUTC,5.0,A wonderful insight,A3RXDCCIRJM6V8,"I have been loving this series and this has given me such an insight into Autumn and the way she acted as she did, especially with Brody and Evie. Good writing always draws you in and you feel what the characters are going through, great writing and you experience every little emotion and nuance, well in this one it is great. I was there with Autumn through her school years feeling every taunt and bite, every time something else happened. Bullies are bullies wherever you go, and wherever you go there are bullies, now as an adult and a stronger person I want to stand up and say no more but as a student I felt like Autumn powerless. Although we meet Brody and Evie and get to know them, this is very much all about Autumn and is a wonderful backstory for the series, the secondary characters are finely drawn but they in no way take over from who the story is meant to be about, it was also wonderful to meet her mum and dad, giving us further insight into the person we know and love.I received a free copy for an honest review,"
2014-05-24,B00JFHKE1Y,5.0,Can't wait,A28GYWBV9ZLMF,This book gives you a little glimpse into Gabe and Catlin's worlds. It gives you a need to read the next one. It's a captivating four chapters that will leaving open mouthed and waiting for the next one. Full review at: [...]
2014-06-6,B00JG6EGW2,4.0,Slow Starter,AOV2OHKK4JRKO,"The book starts of, to me, a little on the slow side.  Then it becomes the outstanding type of book Jay Allan writes.  A good read."
2014-04-18,B00JJYH24A,2.0,"Not as good as the first, and too many stereotype memes",A1XPD3WFBJ38WK,"Gorham's first book is a great standalone novel about an EMP event, although it begs the question (also never resolved in the second book) about why a main character who works for a power company never tries to do anything to bring power back to his small town (hydroelectric and other kinds of power generation exist without sophisticated integrated circuits).This second book, Daunting Days of Winter, feels very much like &#34;ooh, the first book sold well, guess I'll do a second.&#34; It tends to skirt too close to romance novel territory and then plays to all sorts of stereotypes - the Army went to Hell when the gays got their rights, the first thing men want to do when the SHTF is rape women, women get the vapors and fall apart because their man isn't around, the &#34;Indians&#34; (yep, he has Native American characters calling themselves Indians, not their tribe name) are having a hard time now that the alcohol has run out, and the Polish immigrant has a TV sitcom accent and calls himself a Polack a dozen times. None of these memes actually advance the story, and they invoke a right-wing creepiness that wasn't apparent in the first book.No need to read any further books in the series; I'll wish Kyle and his family well and continue to wonder why a guy who works for a power company can't figure out ways to get at least some power restored."
2014-04-15,B00JJZLJRU,5.0,So good!,A1CGO9N0UIOOFY,"What a super book!  This story had everything from laughter, tears, angst, and HEA.  Windsor was the perfect heroine with brains, a backbone, and gentleness.  Mav was built like a rock but had such a soft heart.  I would love for the author to continue this series wih Morg and Steves story....pretty please?"
2014-06-8,B00JM0QUV2,4.0,"Sweet, satisfying, short story",A33Z7O75Z6DE0E,"Note that this story ends at about 50% on kindle since the rest of the book includes samples of other books. This is a  very sweet story about the fulfillment of an unrequited love. The hero, heroine and her step-son are all super likable characters you will be rooting for. Perfect for bedtime reading, or a quick diversion."
2014-04-13,B00JMUVLPC,5.0,Exceeded expectations,AI2HY1YC9RUD1,"If you want to set healthy, realistic goals to lose weight, I highly recommend this book. And it offers another free book!  There are studies about how other diets compare and medical processes that are simplified (or demystified :))  I found exactly what I was looking for and more."
2014-04-21,B00JNHU2MM,5.0,Awesome!!!,A2F1CU28IKVW46,Angie Hayes- love how this second installment is a page turner also!! Keep up the good work! Can't wait for the third!
2014-05-23,B00JNK06K2,5.0,Another good book in the James McGill Series,AAVU0Z43O7KMC,Really enjoy these books. The editing is getting better so there are not as many grammar and spelling errors. The series continues on and I am looking forward to the next one in the series. I like the way he weaves characters from his other series into this books which lends continuity to all his books.
2014-05-3,B00JNPPDRS,5.0,aspiring writers and authors check this out,A2UQ060E1UF84U,"This book has great inputs on the do's and dont's in writing, what you need to learn first and how you present your story. Mike Adams has gives readers attainable and easy to follow advise to write compelling stories. 50 ways is a lot for an inexpensive book such as this."
2014-04-23,B00JO6IO9U,5.0,The book to read if you are new to making websites and blogs,A14PRVP4JK88E7,"I have been learning how to use WordPress for a little while now. Still new at the whole content management system stuff but I know how to install it, change themes and such. The book did a great job on that regard, the information it provides, the instructions are all up to date and accurate. I actually followed the steps as if I didn't know how to do it already. The one thing I was able to benefit from was the domain names section, and also I got more details about the hosting options which will vary depending on what type of site you are building.  This is a nice book to read."
2014-04-29,B00JOQ63IO,5.0,Italian cooking,A39IRQ9IS9MNAK,I love Italian food. So many great recipes here. Can't wait to try the Italian meatballs. I can see myself using this book a lot.
2014-06-17,B00JOXGMH4,5.0,Another great book by Heather Killough-Walden,A1VIN76HYWQQL8,Another great book and series. I was hooked and couldn't put it down until I finished it. If you want a great new author to read try any of Heather's books. You will be hooked just like I am.
2014-07-17,B00JPGDDWM,4.0,Not for the squeamish,A2ZOX31E1B1FB6,"I liked it quite a bit.  Great plot, engaging, well-developed characters.  The in-depth look at the religion of gnosticism was well done, but not for the squeamish.  The author handled the various plot threads well and integrated them deftly.  The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is that when done, I had no desire to read further into the series."
2014-05-8,B00JQDOPSK,3.0,NO MY FAVORITE,AHR3AU7CPID24,HEA - NO CLIFFHANGERJust ok for me. The writing was good but the story didn't grab me. I didn't connect with either character. Received Arc courtesy of Netgalley. The Hot Rod series is a better read to me.
2014-05-3,B00JRGJXUQ,5.0,What a wonderful book to read to a child before they take swimming lessons! Excellent book,ABDR6IJ93HFIO,"This book is outstanding as the pictures are beautiful and really help tell the story. In the book, Donny and Michelle are afraid to get into the water and learn to swim. The children's dad gradually helped them with their fear of the water and they ending up learning to swim and dive. What made the book special is that the kids had such fun that other kids (bunnies) watched and lost their fear of the water and wanted to learn to swim as well.This book would be excellent to read to a child before he or she goes to their first swimming lesson, as it should take away the fear of the water and get them in the mood to learn to swim.Highly recommend this book!"
2014-07-2,B00JRNOW4G,5.0,fantastic series,A9TLQBRLH41B6,"I stumbled on this series by accident, boy am I glad.  I started book one June 19 and just finished the last book July 2.  The story line was good, had great romance, intrigue, character development and family relationships. I enjoyed how the book covered a good span of time.  I came away thinking this was the African American 50 Shades.  Loved it and look forward to reading more books by Ms. Belvin."
2014-06-16,B00JS3BFQ8,5.0,Short but Packed with Emotion!,A1LW0S183QJ6PD,This story was 100 times better than I expected it to be. I was truly amazed at the emotion I felt as I was pulled into it.  I immediately felt the joy and pain of this widowed too young mother from page one. I knew from the very start that this could be me. I celebrated with Carla and felt her bittersweet joy as she resolved a huge conflict.
2014-05-15,B00JS6GW40,5.0,Loved the whole series,A1579RT7TGIPAU,"I loved this whole series, as soon as I would finish one I would jump on Amazon and buy the next one. I do look forward to the next Series Bound."
2014-04-24,B00JS6I07W,5.0,Hilarity at its finest,AKTHNVJZKSJYJ,"Matilda is at it again.  What happens when you cross the Easter Bunny, a hit man, a demigod, a really popular god, a really bad person, a unicorn and a whole lot of mayhem?  A great big huge romp in the hay?  Well...actually you get a wonderful new addition to The Case Files of Dr. Matilda Schmidt.  A Psychologist who is living a life we all secretly dream of living.  Well..maybe the hot sex part anyway!Dr. Schmidt just found out she is being blackmailed by 'the ferret'  and no sooner does he leave then the suicidal Easter Bunny shows up wanting her to help her end his life.  When her very own demigod shows up with yet another problem from the otherworld, clothes start flying and mayhem ensues.This book didn't disappoint.  It's full of laughter and fun and merriment and joy that will lighten any mood.  It's a short story that will fill your life full of rainbow jelly beans and sunny days, no matter what the outside weather might be!  I can't say too much, but if you are in the mood for a light hearted yet hilarious romp through the world of Dr. Matilda.  Warning...rated X!  You may want to grab all three books in this series....yeah...it's that good!"
2014-07-11,B00JS9WHFU,5.0,A gift from Erica Stevens.,A39E0OJQ8U3R31,"I feel like Erica Stevens completely spoiled her readers by giving us another book in The Captive Series. I soaked up every word of this book. It was hard to put down when there was more to uncover in Jack and William's and even Aria and Braith's stories. Fans of The Captive Series will be extremely happy with this book.The love story in Redemption is absolutely perfect. I don't think Erica Stevens could have possibly come up with a better pair of characters to bring together than Jack and Hannah. All the conflict and difficulty they faced in being together made this a very entertaining read, and the ending of the book had me absolutely glued to my Kindle."
2014-04-23,B00JSW7IH4,4.0,Very smart and uplifting book!,A3HVJCC0Z4F65N,"I got an email offering a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. I read the complete Nashville series and loved it so I figured ...why not!Becca is a girl who lives a quiet (Amish like) life and Matt is a boy who lives with his grandmother and is an amazing baseball player. Will love ever be enough...This book is amazing, but had a very slow start. I was getting confused and was wondering when the excitement was going to kick in. That is why I only gave it four stars. The story is amazing but the beginning was too slow for me to get involved with the characters from the starting point. Still, I was glad I stuck with it because the story is great."
2014-05-28,B00JT1HP5Y,4.0,Great read,A1FRYNZ1CA6YT9,"This is a first time read from this author. The story was fast,mysterious, intriguing and fun to read. I like the interaction between the character's and looking forward to the next book this fall.Recommended if you like regency with a little mystery."
2014-05-21,B00JTF86C6,5.0,I loved the hard series!,AUMB67O5X6X4X,Omg!  The hard series was absolutely amazing!  I just started on duces story. I wish the series wasn't over. I would love to know what happens next. Hopefully in duce and Italy's story will wind up filling us all in! I've read so many series and books. But these were definitely the best 4 books ever! If you haven't started reading them your missing out big time!
2014-06-14,B00JTFFU7K,3.0,Along Came A Tiger,AK416MLKE1AH5,This book was to short for the story that felt like it was started... with a longer book I think this story could have evolved into something that would have made me add this author to my favorites list.
2014-04-25,B00JTJQZ70,5.0,Another Hit!,A1QIVPV4GRJ14W,"I don't know how she does it, but this author ALWAYS writes interesting stories that keep my attention and make me want to read more. I have followed the MacLarens since the author's first book and they have always been the kind of people that I can relate to in my own storybook world. This version, a contemporary romance, is different than what I am used to from her but it works for me. Hard Landing lets me take a look at the MacLarens in modern day times. Trey MacLaren is one of the romance novel characters I have ever read; he and Jesse are the perfect couple and when a wedge is placed between them, I felt myself rooting for them wholeheartedly. That's how connected the author makes the reader and her characters and it's that connection that keeps me coming back for more every time she writes a new novel. Hard Landing is worth a read for anyone who likes romance novels, especially novels that have such a talented author as Shirleen Davies."
2014-06-29,B00JTOFIR8,4.0,Trickery,A1CJ5QY5NPS3TR,This book was kind of hard to get into but as you keep reading it's gets better. The things that went on with Kayla & Gabby I see why the became good friends. I hope there is a part 2 if not I hope it's coming.
2014-04-28,B00JU8H8IA,1.0,Plagiarizing is a crime. RIGHT?,AXTQB1DY17ZUQ,"Yes I am not the only reader who suddenly realized that they, unwittingly purchased a story that had been done before. The Other Side is the same freaking book I bought four years ago. New names and changing the ethnicity of the male character does not make it a new book Ms. Bates, did you really think no one would notice; especially since many avid readers of the interracial/multicultural romance genre recycle and reread books on their Kindle. I'm floored that Amazon has continued to let this type of literary thievery continue; sadly this is not the first book to be plagiarized on this cite. This type of underhanded method of theft needs to be stopped. I for one won't ever purchase another book bye this individual."
2014-04-28,B00JU93M6Q,5.0,Awesome!,A179Q0SO6QMZ97,"This is the first 5 star book I have read in awhile. The characters were real. The relationship grew. The heroine was strong, smart and successful. The rock star was an image, but the man was real. I loved it!"
2014-07-15,B00JVF40C4,1.0,All over the place,A325GJ8CS8VOG3,"Thought this was going to be an interesting and enjoyable read.  It was not.  I did not care for the writing, the flow of the story or the story itself.  I will not be reading book two."
2014-07-5,B00JVX6XZS,4.0,Liam list... it was ok,AV4UGRLN53ULW,I read Vivienne list first which I do suggest. I gave this book 4star's cause some of this book bored me. This author used a lot of words that I had no idea what they meant. Viv first day of school really really bored me. Since I gave the book 4 star's I did enjoy most of the book. It's not my favorite but not the worst either.
2014-04-24,B00JW4RP6W,5.0,Perfect Ending to an amazing series!,A1GECJN7XHDKU6,"Complimentary copy provided by author for an honest review.Wow, this book is my favorite in the series!!! I absolutely love the Destined Series by Ashley Suzanne, and reading Epiphany brought out so many emotions for all of the characters. Epiphany is the last book in the series, and as much as I don&#8217;t want to let these characters go, I absolutely loved how this series ended.Skylar and Mira are the main characters in Epiphany, most of the book revolves around them, but don&#8217;t worry we still get Danny, Jacoby, and Kylee are all there too. I loved looking back at some of the things that happened in previous books with the glimpses that Ashley provided us throughout, but not being stuck re-reading chapters of the previous books, just enough to remember why you loved (or hated) these characters so much.Skylar is still hot as ever, and I absolutely love him, but a few times in the first half of this book, I&#8217;m like WTF are you doing dude?! DO NOT RUIN THIS! And Mira is Mira, crazy, fun, passionate, and crazy in love with Skylar. I love her character and she reminds me so much of myself, well not the whole falling in love with my fiance&#8217;s best friend (Mirage) thing, but the rest of her personality, yes. And Mira and Skylar together, OMG, they are hotter than ever. I loved the scene on the motorcycle in the rain.. ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT! And will probably never look at my husbands bike again without thinking of the things that can be done on it ;)Something great happens to Skylar and Mira and then it turns horrible. I think Ashley did an amazing job of describing what Mira goes through during this part of the book, because it is very honest, and you feel her pain and everything else she is going through, during this time in the book.I loved how this story, well the whole series really, grabs you and doesn&#8217;t let you go till the last word. Epiphany is no exception to this, it is amazing, but instead of screaming &#8220;WTF Ashley why did you screw with my head?!&#8221; after finishing it, you are brought to tears, well at least I was. Between everything that happened in the book, and knowing it&#8217;s the last of these amazing characters that I truly love, it was just an emotional last few paragraphs for me.The Epilogue of this book is what really did it for me, seeing how everything ends up years down the road, it was just the perfect ending to the perfect series. Seeing these characters grow through out all of the books, and especially this one, was amazing. These characters are ones that will stay with you long after the book is over. You&#8217;ll always love Mira and Skylar, half an on/off relationship with Danny, and wish for a best friend as amazing as Kylee.If you haven&#8217;t read this series, your are missing out. There should be nothing stopping you now that all of the books are released (or soon to be released). These characters, the twists in the plots, the friendships, the writing, everything about this series and this book are superb, and I loved each and every one of these books more and more as I made my way through the series.I am not one to re-read books a lot, but this series, this series, will definitely be on my list of books to re-read, so make sure you are adding this one to your TBR list. You definitely do not want to miss out on this amazing series by Ashley Suzanne. It will have you in tears, laughing, screaming, saying WTF, crying, and falling in love with a hot biker."
2014-04-29,B00JW98CPA,5.0,Complicated Creatures,A2E1952HUEKG3Q,"This is one of those books that is so impossible to write a review for. It's such a great book that you absolutely have to leave a review, but what can you say that isn't going to be a spoiler? I shall give it a go, because this book definitely deserves a five star review.Complicated Creatures has a little bit of everything. Romance, mystery, international travel, and even a little action. Jack and Sam are very believable characters. I always like it when I can feel a real connection, like they are my friends.I can't say much else without giving away something and taking away the pleasure of you reading it for yourself, but don't pass this one up. You will regret it."
2014-06-26,B00JYEQOYO,4.0,Interesting start to a college adventure series,AZV90AHN71U9W,What I enjoyed most about Antioch College is the visual picture Goth paints of early college days.  His descriptive style drew me in and I felt like I could see the students mulling around on the grass in front of the brick building or hanging out in the quaint town with the funky shops nearby.  This is a short read designed to draw you into a series so there's much left open with Evan and his counterparts.  I'm interested to see where the story goes.
2014-04-30,B00JYKH75I,5.0,Soapmaking very interesting skill!,A2UFPTFGJM7VVM,"I am so happy I purchased this book. A friend of mine is having some skin problems and she has tried basically everything.  Making your own soap is a great way to control what is in your soap.  The instructions in this book are detailed and easy to follow.  I will definitely recommend this book to her so she can give soap making a try.  And for an added plus she can also sell the soap if she really gets into it, soap making is also a great business idea."
2014-05-2,B00JYLTX8Q,4.0,3.75 romantic stars,AW4NFCPN81CS3,"3.75 stars:  SNOWED UNDER is the contemporary, new adult, erotic romance storyline from author Jen Greyson. The focus of the story is on environmental activist Cassidy and Alaskan logger Teague Whetman. Cassidy is determined to shut down his operations in Alaska but is unprepared for the storm that rages outside and inside of her heart.Written from alternating first person POV (Cassidy and Teague) the premise follows Cassidy as she leaves the warmth of hometown San Diego behind landing in the wilds of Alaska preparing to protest against Whetman Logging. When a fierce winter storm shuts down everyone and everything Cassidy finds herself a reluctant houseguest of the man whose business she was targeting.  Enter one angry moose, an avalanche, eight feet of snow, power outages and a shortage of food -Cassidy is definitely out of her element.The attraction between Cassidy and Teague is immediate.  Near frostbite, a concussion and a raging moose push Cassidy and Teague closer together but Cassidy is left struggling between her beliefs and her attraction to Teague Whetman.  Cassidy&#8217;s eyes and her mind will be open to the possibilities that not all logging is an environmental catastrophe waiting to happen. Without controlled logging, many people (and animals) would never survive.Jen Greyson pulls the reader into a winter wonderland of ice and snow. From the darkened forests of Alaska and the men who work and live the terrain, SNOWED UNDER  is a romantic storyline about two people who would never have met under any other circumstances until a feisty one woman protest tugs at the heart of a man who has been without a woman for a very long time.I was gifted a copy"

2014-06-2,B00JZO5CFK,3.0,Not the best,A2FZ2I2TZJM1NJ,"This story was a fine read, though certainly not in my favorite list. It had a nice flow and it really never lagged. My problems with it though came from the main characters relationship. For me there was no chemistry. I couldn't see how a lawyer would be all that interested in not only an  ex con but also someone who hadn't finished high school. I mean, what do they even talk about?  At one part of the story this 40 year old lawyer and 27 year old ex con were discussing their high school years. It didn't seem practical to me and grasping. The only thing the ex con could talk about was gardening, lattes, and high school. There was nothing pointing to mutual interest except the sex and since I couldn't fit them together in my head, the sex didn't go anywhere with me.  Now if they were just having sex and a complete focus on their attraction, them maybe. But there were complete sections of them just talking. Hmmm. About what?  No direct mention about what. The author couldn't even come up with anything except for one point mentioning that they talked about high school. Hmmmm. Yeah. It. Didn't. Work.Then there was the sections about the law and crime fighting. There was a judge, A JUDGE, who rolled over on his Miranda rights and talked. What judge who knows the law would do that?  That was just one example. There were many many instances where I'm like, I don't think that can happen. For instance, can someone seriously be sent to jail without a trial, without testimony, without anything?  The key witnesses weren't even all questioned. I mean,I know that there are situations where the system doesn't work but one without even a trial over the death of the son of a judge?  And the media wouldn't be interested in any of that?Yeah, so this story was ok. I won't be rereading it. But it did hold my interest as long as I kept myself distant enough not to be annoyed by the aspects that didn't add up.  I don't think it was worth the money I paid for it though. But what can you do?  Oh well."
2014-05-7,B00JZO5CFK,5.0,Love this series!,A21XH6JSYWOIX,Wow. I loved the first book in the series but this one was so much better. I loved the build up of these two characters. The chemistry and flirting was only part of it. The story had suspense keeping me on the edge of my seat wanting more. I loved that we got to see Julian and Matt interacting again. They are just such a sickening sweet couple.The interaction between the sub characters was hilarious at times too. Cole was ridiculous with his no filter. And of course there's Hunter's dad. He just cracked me up the things he would say.This was my kind of book through and through. I look forward to see what Jaime has in store for this series. She's my new go to author.
2014-05-3,B00JZQAE2Y,5.0,PERFECT!,A1TQYAEFWXVJWV,"BACK TO YOU (DREAMS 1.5) by FAITH ANDREWSPerfection.This is the perfect follow-up to Faith Andrews' debut book, Man of My Dreams. When I found out that there's actually a follow-up, I was so excited to read it. Book 1 was deep, emotional and very real so to have a follow-up to that is such a wonderful thing. I mean, after reading Man of My Dreams I have this idea and question in my head in how Mia & Declan can move past what happened? It's a big work and maybe a difficult one and that question was answered in this book.Mia & Declan did moved past what had happened and was able to find forgiveness and acceptance and was able to move forward to a more better version of themselves and their marriage but the journey is not easy. It was obvious from the first chapter of this book that they both have something to say. They need to express it & talk it out for them to really feel that they actually moved on but they were holding back. It was difficult, on both sides. Mia was full of guilt while Declan though he tries to deny is is still hurting and still has doubts. But ya know what I like about how this novella was written? Faith Andrews showed their vulnerability and doubts in the most sincere and real kind of way. True, both Mia & Declan have faults but they both recognized it and acknowledged the fact that it takes two to tango and is willing to make things work for the better and everything about the way they think and express themselves in the story is so poignant and raw. The way Faith Andrews wrote every scene is full of true emotions and you will feel it, even if you haven't experienced what the characters are going through you will feel it deep in your core and in your heart like you are actually feeling the same emotions. It was wonderful. Perfection.Fans of Man of My Dreams will sure love this novella. You will love it. I did. I so did. However, I want more and I don't want Mia & Declan's story to end. I hope there's more and speaking of more, we will have Noah's story. Like Faith Andrews said, he deserves one and his own HEA. There'sno date yet and maybe Faith haven't even started writing it but hey, I will wait. I can wait and I am sure I will love his book.This series just keeps getting better and I can't wait for more. :)** Also posted on my TUMBLR & GR account"

We move forward with our personal knowledge and depending on how we were raised by our parents. It is always interesting to read about raising children. This book is very well structured.

2014-05-31,B00K08PA1G,5.0,More than I expected.  Very enjoyable and loved the characters!,A2EAORFHCNOLHV,"Crave was so much more than I was expected from the synopsis.  Jake and Lilly both have issues from their past to work through and have a hard time not only trusting each other, but trusting in themselves and the emotions they feel.  Their relationship seemed to be something of a &#34;push-pull&#34; affair - they both alternated between pulling each other in and pushing each other away.  I think this added to the personality of each character.  Both Lilly and Jake were very well-developed.  I particularly enjoyed  Lilly's character and her outlook on life, and she was very easy to relate to - I could see myself saying &#34;damn hair dryer&#34; since I have experienced mornings just like Lilly has.  While Jake was depicted as being a playboy, there was enough back story provided to see it was a protective mechanism so he wouldn't get hurt again.The story was primarily told from the perspective of both Jake and Lilly) and in the first person.  Ms. Delaney did an amazing job with the transitions between the two characters and using the first person perspective - not once was I confused as to who was telling the story, and I feel that it added more to the story to see the different ways Jake and Lilly looked at things, as well as be privy to the internal thoughts each of them have.I will definitely be reading more of Ms. Delaney's books.  It should be noted this book was received as a gift in exchange for an honest review."

Now in Sway...we are given more insight into his past heartaches and why he became the man he is today....and I really fell for him =)When he needs to get away from his life, he moves in with his good friend and client Vanessa and is thrown into a relationship with her younger sister Whitney. But it's complicated...another age difference and their pasts preventing them from completely being free to open up.Kate Roth has a talent for writing beautiful love stories that veer away from the usual formula and I think it is refreshing. Her women are strong yet vulnerable and her men are not your average cookie cutter guys.Another sweet and bittersweet love story where everyone is not always how they seem on the outside.Really looking forward to more from this talented author!**** 4.5 **** &#34;fighting for an HEA&#34; stars =)~ Review has been done in conjunction with Platypire Reviews ~"

2014-05-22,B00K1DWC2U,5.0,My Favorite Book of the Series,A26GHQOTRZMGG8,"Edge is the third book in the Fire on Ice Series. The first book was Bound and the second was Captive. Both of the first two books were about Kate and Ryker (oh, Ryker!). Take a peek at my reviews to see what I thought of those two books. This third book is about Ryker&#8217;s team mate, Luke Hudson. If I thought Ryker was swoon worthy, I had no idea until I met Luke.This is actually Luke and Dell&#8217;s love story. Luke was injured during a hockey game and ends up in rehab with a minor league team. This is where we meet Adella. Luke just needs to find a way to get Dell to let go of her rule of not dating a hockey player. Okay, that&#8217;s all you&#8217;re getting from me. No spoilers, but I will tell you that there is a happily ever from our couple.Brenda Rothert does it again with a story of passion, angst, and ultimately love. She gives us steamy scenes, including some totally swoon worthy love scenes. I love the twists and turns throughout the book and we still see a bit of Kate and Ryker, but this is most definitely Luke and Dell&#8217;s book. Pick it up now! Such a great read for those of us that like our BBF&#8217;s a little alpha, a little sweet, and a little bruised."

The book has a fast tempo, good storyline, and made me laugh.It was a realistic point of view, capturing feelings and thoughts so you feel you are there. I had fun reading it and read it beginning to end without stopping to do more than fill my coffee cup again. I found myself chuckling, moaning when her heart was broken, and understanding what she was going through.I will be looking for more from the author because she knows her stuff."

Previous smoothie aficionados focused more on high fruit and juice based drinks; however, this book illustrates how important green, chlorophyll rich smoothies are to our nutritional needs.  They can provide even more benefits than supplements and basic dieting alone.  The recipes are simple to make and absolutely delicious.  I&#8217;m going to make these green smoothies part of my daily regimen for fitness and achieving a better, fiber-rich diet.  I strongly recommend this book!"

Lots of useful stuff in the book about the e-learning platforms and the great add-on would be to write something that reflects a wider perspective and scope towards earning few more bucks using the internet world and technology.Detailing the courses online and the source is a rich addition to the book. Thoroughly recommended read and worth buying."

As always with Dawn's style, you know its going to get really emotional and it wouldn't be DH without the hottest  steamy sex scenes either.This 1 has had me ugly crying in 1 instance, then with the next line, my all time favorite characters come out with something that has me cracking up laughing my way through the tears.In Fortitude we are dealing with Ava's fight with the dreaded big C,  so many people suffer with in this world and Ava and Mason battle through this in their own way, the only way they know how. Because it's a fight not everyone can always win, just hold on to these 3 words, Faith, Hope and Love and pray you come out the other side.Mason and Ava Fox are the most awesome couple and have always been the perfect match for each other. I have loved every minute with them and I feel like I've lived their past 20 years with them as my friends. Too me they are so much more than characters in a book, and it's been 1 hell of a rollercoaster ride.This was just the perfect ending to the most fantastic heart wrenching emotional series. I am very sad to say goodbye to the Fox's but they needed closure and an end to their story, but my favorite book couple will always have a place in my heart and I know they are only a page away.Thank you DH for giving us that Glorious Bastard and His Little Warrior. &#60;3 &#60;3 &#60;3"
2014-05-21,B00K5AEV28,5.0,Easy to read and very informative,A2KWQ64TRHB3YH,"This book by Jack Abner contains all the basic information that people need to know to understand how to secure and maintain a good credit rating. In six easy to read and very informative chapters, Abner explains what a credit score is, what determines it, how to find out what score you have, and how to fix it. He also explains various terms, gives readers the history of the system, tells what lenders look at in the score, and how to keep scores high. He informs readers that the more accounts that they have raises their credit score because it shows that lenders are willing to lend you money.  He reveals that lenders may see a different report than you are able to see. He also tells why credit scores determine eligibility for loans, a high score can result in a lower loan rate, and how people can secure a free copy of their rating. While a score of 720-850 is excellent, he advises that people should shoot for a score above 760.In short this is the book to use to help you improve your credit rating."

The story-line was very interesting as was the setting. It was fast-paced and exciting. The only problem I has was the ending, it seemed too quick, like the author was just trying to end it. It's my own personal opinion, but I would have like a little more depth to the ending. Other than that, a very good read.  The little excerpt at the end, &#34;The Enigma Strain&#34; was really good and piqued my interest so much that I am really looking forward to reading the rest of it."

2014-05-21,B00KA02IFA,4.0,Jayne and Flynn's riviting story continues to thrill in Queen of Hearts!,A1BJN9HHYBJJZF,"*I was given a complimentary copy of Queen of Hearts for an honest review.After being left with a hell of a book hangover and slightly miffed after a cliffhanger of an ending, I jumped at the opportunity to read Queen of Hearts early. I needed to know immediately what happened to Jayne King, Flynn McGuire, Vince, and that massive jerk hole Doyle McGuire. Queen of Hearts is full of suspense, angst that comes with two completely stubborn main characters, and off the charts steamy chemistry between Jayne and Flynn.We begin with Jayne living away from Las Vegas. She fled her life after it completely fell apart in a blaze of gunfire and deception. She loses every single person that was important to her. Going back to her hometown in Oklahoma, she tries to live a simple life complete different from her existence as a high priced call girl. As much as she tries to transform herself into a different person, her old life permeates every thought. She does find a connection with Jackson, the owner of the diner where she waitresses. He is a down-to-earth, gorgeous man who wants more from Jayne, but she is unable to open her heart to him. Flynn still weighs heavy on her heart. After receiving a visit from an unexpected person from her past, she decides to go back to Las Vegas and confront the problems and danger she desperately tried to escape.The plot line for the Queen of Hearts is more fast paced and action packed than See Jayne Play. Jayne is determined to find out what happened to Flynn, Vince, and her father, despite the attempts by her friends to stop her. I love Jayne&#8217;s tenacity. She&#8217;s a very strong willed character, something I love in my heroines. I was a bit upset with Flynn&#8217;s character at the beginning of this book. I really wanted him to step up a bit more when pursuing Jayne. But Jami redeems him in my eyes with the lengths he goes to protect her later on in the story. Vince&#8217;s character infuriated me throughout the whole book! He was secretive, combative, elusive, and just plain aggravating. I loved every minute of it! His storyline with Kelsey has me wanting more. I hope Jami continues the series with their story. I really enjoyed all the secondary characters I had one problem with this story, however. I wanted more scenes with Doyle McGuire&#8217;s character. The reader is told of all his nefarious ways, but never shown them. I would like to see his evil character in action. I think it would have really cemented his place as the bad guy in this book instead of just being told he was terrible.Queen of Heart is a addicting, fast paced read. I really enjoyed the suspense aspect of the plot. The characters are wonderfully complex and flawed. The sex scenes are romantic and steamy. I look forward to more books my Jami Denise. I give Queen of Hearts 4 out of 5 stars!Written by Dee McGee - Booze, Bookz, and Bad Boyz"

2014-05-24,B00KB4V28E,5.0,Be Prepared to Experience Psychological Manipulation...Amazing Writing!,A2GCUDSESSTNWU,"~ ~ ~Warning per author/publisher: This is extreme psychological reconditioning, the deconstruction of someone's mind. Please be aware that there is extreme non-con in there. There is also kidnap and captivity, with violence. Antidote is extreme dark erotic romance, and will have triggers that will upset on multiple levels.My Review:MIND. FreakINGLY. BRILLIANT.IF you want to know what psychological manipulation feels like, read Antidote. If you don't. Don't.This is not a stand-alone. You must read Don't..., first. Then read it again before you start this one. I should have. I struggled to remember pertinent information, but either Jack L. Pyke did her job of implanting information into my brain when I read Don't, or she did her job of extracting what I had buried and then forced me to remember. Then she tied it all together, expanded on it, ripped it apart and created a brand new beginning.THE CHARACTERS""I can't climb in to my head and order thoughts as easily as I do my sock drawer...""Jack Harrison - We talk about broken, f'ed up characters all the time. Jack trumps them all.""Jan got you like that, and I f'ing loved how even Gray was nearly caught in his gentle trap.""Jan Richard- Vanilla, intelligent, ""normal"". His nightmare became mine. Not only does he ground this story, but he lets us see.""Part of me swore that the search for that quiet was what drove Gray, because the moment Jack quietened, so did he.""Gray Raoul - Complex. Dangerous. Powerful. His deeply hidden compassion almost did me in.THE STORY""There was a brush of his nose along Gray's jaw for the second time now, and the need to find out the what and why behind it nearly killed me.""I don't even think I can tell you anything. I'm short changing this fascinating piece of work by not expounding here, but I fear there is nothing that I can say to do it justice. Not to mention that I'd give something away.In generalities the book starts on a high. Things are good and this is where it must start, at a pinnacle, both because it has to give you that high to cling on to and also because it makes the depths of despair that much more poignant. There is no light at the bottom, but there is memory of it.I will just say, IF you're up for it, read this.THE WRITINGThe brilliance of this work comes from the way the author was able to keep me off kilter and grounded all at once. I was flailing, but for reasons. I couldn't put the book down. At the same time, I had to take breaks to digest, adjust, and breathe. The intensity caused me to experience real life physical reactions; racing heart rate, tears, depression, and anger. It takes a lot, any more, for me to reach that level of response to writing. It was more than just the nature of the story, it was the writing that gripped me so hard.Ms. Pyke is building something here. This book took a wild deviation from where I thought this series would go. Not in the nature of the events, but in the nature of where I thought the main players would go. This opens entirely new paths.I was struck at the end by the way the author's writing changed to fit the moment. It became lyrical only when it was necessary and it may have saved me. I read the last two pages over and over and over again.~ ~ ~I would like to thank Jack L. Pyke and Forbidden Fiction for providing me with an ARC/Review Copy in exchange for my honest review.~ ~ ~"

Setting her sights on opening her own resturant, she focuses only on her dream, not wanting to let anythhing get in her way.Morgan Woods is struggling to keep his business, as well as his father's, afloat during the economic downturn. His father isn't feeling well so he's taken over running the construction crew for Cara's Kitchen.In his mind, women are trouble, but he can't seem keep his mind from wandering to Ms. Cara Carson. There is something about her that makes him want to throw his convictions aside and grab on with both hands.Cara felt an instant attraction to Morgan but has talked herself out of pursuing anything with him. Not only can she not take another loss, but the man is working for her. Its a line she's struggling not to cross.I really enjoyed this book. The only thing I would have liked to have seen was a little more information about the tragedy Cara suffered earlier in the book, as well as the reasons behind Morgan's insecurities.~~Wicked Reads Review Team~~"

2014-06-12,B00KC90VG2,3.0,A little slow but good storyline,A125ZBPAZNHLVD,"*Received a copy of this book in change for an honest review*I enjoyed this book, once I got to about halfway through. The first half was slower than I like, and I don't feel it should've taken that long to develop the characters. My favorite character was Jo, and honestly, I knew from her first introduction what would happen to her. I thought there should have been more of a paranormal element to it. What was there was good but it didn't feel like that was the main arc. Overall, the book was a decent read. I'd like to see what else the author does in the future."
2014-06-25,B00KDIC5FC,5.0,Another brilliant book by Holly Martin!,A3IFZVH1FA28T9,"Get out your passport-because with Holly Martin's newest release, One Hundred Proposals, you are about to go around the world in the search of the perfect proposal.  The journey is filled with laughs, misunderstandings, and most of all, love between two people who are afraid to share that sentiment with each other.Written in Ms. Martin's creative style, One Hundred Proposals is the story of Harry and Suzie, who work together on Suzie's website, the.perfect.proposal.com which assists people in creating the perfect proposal. Everyone around them can see that they do love each other, and are truly meant to be together, but neither Harry and Suzie can admit their feelings to each other. But when Harry begins a blogging challenge of 100 proposals to Suzie in order to find the perfect one, we are taken around the globe to the most unique places and amazing ways one could ever hope to propose to someone they love. But will Suzie be able to survive 100 proposals without her heart breaking every time? Could the perfect proposal simply be the one where Suzie says yes?I absolutely love Ms. Martin's style. I laugh, I feel heartbreak, I'm visually transported to exotic locations with her lush descriptions. Harry and Suzie are both completely loveable characters that you want to cheer for from the first page. I picked up this book and could not put it down. Right now, it's my favorite book I've read in 2014. An absolute pleasure to read, I highly recommend this to anyone who is a romantic at heart."

As a Haitian-Dominican woman I am always trying to cook different types of food for my family. I already used several of the breakfast recipes and two of the dinner ones. I definitely plan to use many more recipes. My favorites were the French Classic Crepes because they used ingredients that I already had on hand. The potato pancake with Cantal Cheese was definitely unique and easy. And for dinner my family loved the Chicken Raclette dish. Simply amazing! Great job Patrick Smith!
2014-06-19,B00KFTA0YC,3.0,OK MC Read,A3U7OYM75C6CS2,"There were aspects of the story I enjoyed, and others not so much.I wasn't overly fond of Piper at first.  She was willing to sleep with men to get ahead at work, and her personality was hard to warm up to.  At times she was portrayed as a strong business woman, but then she would seem weak in her relationship with Grizz.  The flip flopping made it hard to warm up to her.Grizz was another character I had mixed feelings about.  He would act like he cared about Piper but then they'd get in a fight and he'd go have sex with someone else.  He did try to do the right thing for Piper towards the end, which redeemed him somewhat.Both characters had tragic pasts but they were briefly discussed and didn't really help to explain how they made the characters the way they were.I would have liked a little more insight into the club itself.  Several members were mentioned, but there really wasn't an emphasis on what the club did.  Grizz would just disappear for a few days with little explanation as to why or what was happening during that time.There was a bit of violence in this story, including a rape scene.  While the level of violence didn't bother me, it may bother some people so they should take that into consideration before reading this story.Despite my issues with the story, I'd be open to reading more from this author.**A free copy was provided by the author.**"

I have loved EVERYTHING that she has written, and Taint has become an all time favorite.  This precious, delicious, intensely romantic work will be read by me over and over.  It has become the book that  I will read every time I want to read something romantic and juicy.  Thank you Ms. Jennings for bringing Justice Drake to life."
2014-06-13,B00KFXLFM4,5.0,A new focus for beginners,A14PRVP4JK88E7,"I love how this book is lay out, it starts with getting to know the equipment you will use, and then moves from needles to the different type of yarns, something that I haven't seen in other books about knitting till now. It isn't until the last chapter that you get instructions on how to get started with whatever you will  do, sock or hat, etc. I would recommend this book for beginners who have yet to know the materials very well as this is the focus of the book rather than different knots and patterns that you would find on regular beginner's book."
2014-05-27,B00KHAXWX0,5.0,Awesome sequel!!,ABJBRXZA3OYER,"Susan Mac Nicol takes us on another fantastic journey into the magyckal & mysterious world of Witches, Warlocks, Withinners & Sprites in this sequel to Double Alchemy.In this story, Quinn & his boyfriend Cade are now happily living together, but there's still danger lurking at every turn.  Quinn is the Grand Master of the Warlocks & has been trying to find & destroy the Witchfinder General, who is on a mission to kill all Witches & Warlocks.  So far, the Witchfinder General has stayed one step ahead of Quinn & has evaded him with some magyck of his own.  The answer to finding & destroying him may lie in an ancient book called the Book of Shadows.  It's a book of spells that used to belong to a 17th century Witch, but has ended up in the hands of a beautiful seductive Witch named Valensia, who Quinn used to date years ago.  She didn't take their breakup too well at the time, when he told her he just wanted to date men exclusively, so he knows he may have a hard time convincing her to turn the book over to him, but will do whatever it takes.Cade, in the meantime, has been embracing his inner Sprite.  Having just found out he was Fey or a Water Sprite when he met Quinn, he wants to learn more about his ancestry & their healing powers.  He gets the opportunity to do so when he is injured & the Sprites take him away to heal him, but also teach him how to use his own healing powers.  But this puts him in danger as well, because now he's being tracked by a Chaser, a goblin-like creature who tracks Sprites for Collectors.  A Collector is also a Sprite, but wants to steal the healing powers of other Sprites to make themselves more powerful.  They will do whatever it takes to steal these powers, including killing the other Sprite.There's a lot going on in this story.  Enemies to be dealt with, alliances to be formed & an infatuated male co-worker of Cade's who won't take no for an answer & has Quinn green-eyed with jealousy.  There's also a lot of hot sex, but some not on the page.  It seems Cade & Quinn have a bit of a kinky side, but a lot of it's left up to our imagination!  All in all, a well written book.  If you are a fan of paranormal, then you will love this!  If not, then you should give it a try.  But you have to read Double Alchemy first, because this sequel is not a standalone.  Highly recommend both books!"

Rachel and Kerr are both written really well and the author does a great job exploring these characters without falling into the same old boring routines that are prevalent in a lot of crime fiction.The book is long but it went by really fast, which means that it kept my interest. Enough twists and turns without getting dragged down in the details.  Definitely a sign of a good book!"

This book can be read as standalone but I highly suggest that you read No One&#8217;s Angel in order to get a better understanding why Kevin is needed to protect Lexi.College is a place where one begins to find oneself and explore their independence.  For Lexi Feron, she has been living in the shadows of her missing twin sister and so when the opportunity to go off to college, she couldn&#8217;t wait to be on her own.

Lexi wants to live and enjoy her new freedom that she has been denied for so long. She thought college would be fun but what she didn&#8217;t expect was that she was hated and her peers were jealous of her. Alone and lost, Lexi just goes through the motions till Kevin reminds her that she is beautiful and full of light and hope. Battling inner desires and love, Kevin tries to separate his work and personal life but he is failing when it comes to Lexi.

Or will the threats from Angel&#8217;s ex disrupt any chance for Lexi and Kevin?In this second installment, Kelly Walker did an amazing job focusing on Lexi and Kevin as they lean on each other for support. This book had so many qualities that I love in NA book. I loved the simplicity of their romance and the added twist of suspense in their storyline.  Ms. Walker did surprise as a new added surprise twist of events occurred in the last few chapters of the book. No One&#8217;s Hero is a perfect example of great storytelling and characters that are lovable. I look forward to reading more works from Kelly Walker and I can&#8217;t wait for the third book of the series."
2014-05-28,B00KKUPWXK,5.0,I had no idea this could work,A1YBM3LBZ07QQS,"I had heard about people making a lot of money using the website Fiverr, but I didn't know about the cool tricks you can use to make money on there even if you're not good at drawing caricatures or making voiceovers or something. This book was very illuminating - it tells you how to make big Fiverr money while doing very little of the work yourself.The trick is pretty simple but pretty smart. I would never have thought of this myself. You really do less than the people who work hard to create original stuff while making more money than they do. I'm not gonna ruin the book, but suffice it to say if you want to make money online, this is a great, easy place to start."

If I am going to root for Nathan, there will have to be some serious stops pulled out. Not much to like about him so far. I would highly recommend but I would wait until all of them are out before getting started.  I read both of them in 3 hours or less and would like to see a little more happen in each book."

2014-06-6,B00KLRBGIC,4.0,gifted book,AQ9M23BNJZRK4,"4 stars.I love this authors type of writing. This my second book from her and it didn't disappoint. It was great to have Marcy as the mma fighter and jax as the trainer. It was a nice switch of the role and it made it more interesting. I loved Marcy's overprotective friends, two step and Reid. The way this group of fighters were such a tight knit group made it feel like family. Marcy's strong will and determination made her a great lead character. Jax was also a nice alpha character for this book because of his background. Only disappointment was that I was hoping for a little more past story on the two so we could feel a little more connected to the characters. Overall the book has a story and great sex appeal.Marcy is trading for the championship, but something is holding her back, but no one knows what. In comes jax the coach and phycologist. He thinks he can fix her. She doesn't think she needs to be fixed. In weeks the see who they are and what they can do for each other. The more time they spend, the more drawn they are to each other. Their feelings collide and sparks fly. What could possibly go wrong?I love that I got to read another book from this author and I hope to read more. This definetly must read."

2014-06-6,B00KNJQ2T6,5.0,Romance with a side of bdsm~,A26OF6WI5RVAR9,"This to me was not your typical bdsm type book. Yes, it had some kink but not that much. It has a romantic focus along with the bdsm topic but the point I think the author was trying to add was the concept of complete trust. Sebastian and the men of Twisted & Tied are not only sex on legs but men with wonderful hearts. I look forward to the next in the series and I want so much more."

She gets the pleasure of meeting two super hot guys in Sean and Ryan.  Each of them are special in their own ways and both very different.  Everyone's life has a different plan and course and which way will Hallie's path go?For only being a novella, this story has so much to offer!  I didn't think a story of this length could leave me feeling so emotionally drained!  Gia was able to give us a story with humor, with love, and with heartache.  She also throws in an awesome BFF in Alex.  He is funny, he is caring and supportive and he deserves his own story too!!!!  Please Gia:  write book 2 ASAP!!!5 Swedish Fish Loving Stars!!!!"
2014-06-4,B00KPIE4TA,5.0,Sweet Historical Romance,A1XA4BJ23AVBT7,"A Bride for the Baron is a historical romance novella by Harris Channing.  In A Bride for the Baron, governess Martha Arden visits her cousin in America while recovering from a broken engagement.  In America, she meets baron Fredrick Von Richter who was at one time engaged to Martha's cousin Chloe.  Both are weary of love because of past broken engagements but they quickly form a bond, a bond that is pulled into question when Martha's former fiance decides to win her back.I really loved A Bride for the Baron.  After reading some heavy contemporary stories lately, it is a nice change of pace to read a sweet historical romance with a bit of drama.  I also felt bad for Samuel cause he wasn't a true villain, just someone who made a mistake by listening to his judgmental father.  Highly recommend A Bride for the Baron for historical romance fans."

This is a quirky little book that goes into detail of the day to day life of a pop star. Before this book, I had no idea who Nate Todd was, but now I do and you will too. A pop stars life is not just all about sex, drugs, and women...ok, well, most of it is, but it is also about how they make their money and all the other people in the background who basically keep them occupied and out of trouble. His lawyers sure do a lot of work to keep him out of jail and making money. This book will make you question if it is really all that it is cracked up to be to be in the lime light all the time and a pop star. Sure the money is amazing, but are you/will you be happy?"
2014-06-22,B00KQX5EU2,1.0,Not What I Expected from the Preview,A20R37WRPLUM1D,"It's a harlequin romance, with the younger, curly haired, cute Johnny and the bigger masculine, burly Grissom. The instant attraction is a bit much to accept, especially since Johnny has never acted on any previous attraction to men he might have felt. Most annoying is the idea that Johnny doesn't choose to get involved with Grissom, it is forced on him. Grissom decides to pursue, and basically ignores Johnny's reluctance to get involved and keeps returning. It's unwanted initially, as in sexual predator or even rape.Not my kind of story, not consensual. I returned it."

The book was written from a point where it can be understood easily even by a lay person.For example, in Chapter 6, the author has highlighted when we should drink water in a table that's so easy to understand.Overall, it's  a small little book and I wished the author had some more chapters on some more valuable advices.

Oh, and she owes people, scary people, for help in the past, and it seems that every single one of them wants her help, like right now!This one had me biting my nails and seriously tired for Ivy LOL  Ok, so she needs to save Jinx, then somethings setting the whole town on fire, there's a crazy Green Lady threatening her, and some vampers who are just dirty, all threatening things and people Ivy loves.Be prepared to get shocked, and mad, and crazy, all at once!

It has all the stuff you need to know about Jelqing and great tips to enhancing, The book is well written with good intention and is full of information you need before making any decisions that may cause damage. The book really helped me understand more about Jelqing. I'm very excited to try all the techniques and hoping I will grow in the long term. If you're looking for a way to naturally enhance your penis without damaging it this book is for you."
2014-07-2,B00KTV5HVM,2.0,"Fun and light, but lacks depth",A5FEPIIKTY9Q2,"Reading this book made me realize it has been eons since I've read a story written in third person, or at least now I noticed it. I can definitely understand why it makes it so difficult to connect with the characters. It constantly felt like I was looking at this story from the side, it didn't draw me in.Now in the chick-lit genre I've read some crazy plot lines, so I definitely don't mind it being over the top as long as the author is able to make it believable. That felt kind of missing for me. Madison simply took it too far for me to be able to just go with it.Jared said he maybe had a position for Madison at his company, but she would already get paid to play his girlfriend at a family dinner. When Madison realizes there is no job at his company, she gets mad and takes revenge on him. First of all that is kind of petty. Second, the way she does that is just not funny. In front of his family Madison declares that she and Jared are getting married. Who does such a thing? They don't know each other, there is barely a connection and this just feels wrong to me. She involved his family and claiming you're getting married is a very big lie. As in when people find out, they will hate you.Of course Madison hasn't really thought this true, as Jared's aunt is really sick and she wants to see the wedding before she dies. Jared's aunt has been like a mom to him, so the man would do anything to make her happy, still marrying Madison might be too much. He's all about coming clean, but it's once again Madison's big mouth that gets them further into trouble and before you know it, she's trying on dresses and choosing flowers.This screamed disaster from the beginning. I had a lot of trouble liking Madison and honestly I really don't like her. She says and does certain things without thinking about the consequences, including the people who might get hurt. In the beginning she doesn't very much like Jared, but after spending two weeks with him, she's almost ready to really marry him. Everything definitely moved fast in this story.Jared seemed like an okay guy. He's the typical rich businessman with commitment issues. As soon as Madison gets in his car, he regrets bringing her along. Things just spiral downwards after that. Getting married is the last thing on his mind, though slowly Madison crawls under his skin, in a good way. I really didn't understand what he saw in her. These two people are complete strangers and I just couldn't see that connection between them.The story was also very short (188 pages) and I feel if it had been longer and things were more deepened, it would have been better. The surface was barely scratched and therefore the characters felt very one dimensional to me.Also it does switches points of view between Madison, Jared, Jared's dad and Jared's ex-girlfriend. Those last two, to me, weren't necessary for the continuity of the story. That she was a vindictive bitch was very easy to figure out, without needing to know her plans upfront.Overall the plot was a bit all over the place and it was hard for me to connect with the characters. I've read other books, were girls need to play fake girlfriends for rich men, that were simply better than this. It's fun and light, but even for a short read it lacks depth for me.*I received a copy through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review*"
2014-06-7,B00KU28VCW,5.0,Awesome Series Starter,A2ABNGB7OPDT7Q,This story will be a highlight of the year for my kindle.  The story and characters were so involved that it sucked me into the new universe Mr. Teasdale created within the first few pages.  And then the epilogue came along and I was stunned and sorry that I was going to have to wait for the next book in the series.  Haven't felt this hyped up for the next book in a series since The Other Side of Hell ended.
2014-06-22,B00KVN6HH6,5.0,what a way to end the series,A1ZZV4VCL1AODA,Wow. I'm speechless this was such an amazing read. What a way to end this series. I cried then had a good laugh then cried some more! I have read this series from book one and as much as I hate to see it end I'm glad she ended this way. This book was well worth the wait!
2014-07-11,B00KWI0GRW,5.0,Fabulous Resource!,A2AMUT1KKC9G76,I never knew such a book existed until I stumbled over it. I love to play the piano and some people have asked me to create simple songs for children as a classroom teacher. Now I have a fabulous resource on my Kindle to refer to. I can't wait to start applying the information in this book!
2014-07-19,B00KXJ69T4,5.0,Each installment is better than the last,A2EOMC3VZGI5E4,"And I truly believed that not to be possible, at least not to such degrees.  Still, these books can indeed stand on their own.  You'll probably get more out of them, reading in order, but the author artistically weaves the pertinent information from previous texts within, without creating boring redundancies for those who have read consecutively.In this novel, the black witch is sought with a vengeance.  Jade has, through instruction from her father and his cronies, honed her warrior skills; however, will it be enough for fighting the dark powers of her sister, who has continued killing and assimilating diverse powers during Jade's  absence?No spoilers here, so that's all you're getting from me.  Once you start reading, you'll be so invested and drawn into the story that putting it down will drive you nuts!  And it's one of those books that will have you reading faster than your usual speed.  I am SO ready to start #4!  Oh how I hate the waiting game...."
2014-07-1,B00KYIMNRQ,3.0,2 1/2 - 3 Stars,A3PT210CN7YJB3,"I give this book 2 1/2 - 3 stars. I had a really hard time getting into this story until over half way through. The writing was fine. I just didn't feel any connection to the story or main characters. If I had it to do over, I would have read something else on my &#34;to be read&#34; list.The female protagonist, Autumn, was an uptight, prudish librarian with a stick up her ass. While many authors are able to take such a character and make their antics comical or endearing, this author did neither.  The male lead was also unimpressive. He was an arrogant, sadistic, ass that got off on toying with Autumn under the guise of conducting research for his latest novel. Any attempt to portray him as a sexy, dominant alpha-male fell short by miles.What you're left with is 2 characters that you don't like, a predictable plot and so-so sex scenes. The story failed to evoke any emotion, probably because there was absolutely no connection to the characters. The ending was lukewarm at best and didn't come nearly quick enough.All in all, I wouldn't recommend this book. Definitely not my cup of tea."
2014-07-7,B00L01ZELS,5.0,Ohmygodohmygodohmygod,A2RMULV25P85EK,My favorite book this year and I've read to 100 so far. I never thought a book about criminals would be awesome. This was a great love story. I come to realize that this is the third book in a series. Going back to read the first two so I can see how the other pairs hooked up.
2014-06-29,B00L0N6NAW,5.0,Good book,A9X290PLHYXX8,It gets your attention and makes you want to know more. I want to know more. I love books like this because there is a story line that I want to know so much more.
2014-06-28,B00L2PM5WI,5.0,Start walking and get healthy.,AS5FSU7SG5UN0,"An excellent fitness and exercise related book solely emphasized on &#8220;Power Walking&#8221; which simply means exercise walking or fitness walking. I always used to think walking is lightest method of exercise and lightest method to gain fitness and stamina. It only works for elderly people who are unable to do heavy exercises. And for us there is no alternative for heavy exercises. But this book totally changed my impression about walking as soon as I took a glimpse on the first chapter. This book is all written about walking and anything you need to know about it, remember and follow. And it really shows that walking alone can be the best and even be the most dependable and effective exercise. Because actually this book gives a very wide and clear knowledge about fitness walking which most of us even those who are walking regularly don&#8217;t know."
2014-06-30,B00L3I1BR4,5.0,Absolutely one of the best books on the subject,A2WZJDFX12QXKD,"Awesome summary of what I have suffered from for years and never quite understood. Insightful and hopeful, but always realistic account of the nature of the beast that is fear of heights. If you want to know more about yourself and are a long time anxious individual I recommend it highly. I learned more than I ever have from a textbook or my own colleagues. Very well done."
2014-07-13,B00L3U9OCG,5.0,finally something new,A9R53DDA70YMP,"This is an excellent book, a mix of military action and good old fashioned science fiction.  I was first a little disappointed in the pace of the book, but after about 4 chapters I could not put it down!  When is the next one?"
2014-07-22,B00L3WEXDY,5.0,Excellent Book To Help You Focus On Positive Affirmations,AK1LAL0FKD7SG,This book is a great read for anyone who is going through any type of negativity in their life. The author breaks down in detail what steps are necessary to use EFT to help negative emotions and bring about positive change. Worth the read.
2014-07-3,B00L4RYEZ0,4.0,A Nice Twist,AIR70RFHJSRW7,"This books starts out with an attention grabber--the main character, Mira, is in the hospital after trying to commit suicide. Her mother is concerned; her father is off on another campaign trip for the up-coming election. We learn quickly that Mira has a gift (or curse). Whenever someone makes skin contact with her, she receives an instant zap of all their memories. The only person immune to her powers is her father.We enter Mira's world, one with a loving mother, never home father and a body guard on constant alert. Mira's life is lonely and due to her ability, she's cut herself off from everyone even more. I'll admit, I wondered where her friends might be or at least, loose acquaintances. But at least, she does run into a wonderfully sweet guy, who accompanies her on this journey (one which her father doesn't instantly approve of, of course.)It was interesting to watch a main character who absolutely hates their ability. Often characters may not like it, but they at least try to use it to their advantage every now and then, where Mira does not. She also attempts to seek professional help and is willing to open up to Dr. Walsh, which was also a nice and interesting twist. Even better, Dr. Walsh believes her, an act which doesn't completely shut Mira out from the world.I found the inner-contrast in Mira very interesting. She's willing to try to commit suicide twice to escape her ability, but on the other hand, is a strong person, ready to take on a powerful opponent when the need arises. She has strengths and weaknesses, both which make her a very sympathetic and realistic character.The world and plot surrounding Mira deepens quickly, making the story run along at a nice pace. There's plenty of emotion, mystery and adventure, which tended to remind me of scenes from the movie Die Hard. I couldn't help but smile at the end chase---although it was really tense!I had no problem connecting to the characters and was glad to see a hero, who is heroic without being overly dashing, overly strong, or overly anything. He's simply sweet, nice and totally lovable.In other words, I recommend this to YA Urban Fantasy fans, who like a bit of romance (but not too hot), a mystery with twists and turns, and actions scenes with a few explosions."
2014-06-23,B00L5F13V4,5.0,Amazing story and book!,A1QVOV1L6ZJXG4,Oh my goodness I loved this book by Author Emerald Barnes.  This story and the characters in the story took me as a reader on a journey of what it is to endure faith when everything seems to be stacked against you.  Madison's journey and path is something I could totally relate to as I was growing up and her problems were my problems.  I loved this story and I connected to her and the people around her.  I loved it and this was one amazing book!
2014-06-23,B00L63FP9G,5.0,A Great Compilation of Cross Training Workouts,A107QCQSFVT6VN,"The &#34;WODZILLA: The Ultimate WOD Compilation 700+ Cross Training Workouts&#34; is decidedly different from other workout and training books. It fits in perfectly with my training philosophy as it takes the focus off vanity and focuses entirely on performance.As my schedule has changed, I have much less time to work out. Fortunately the workouts only take between 15 to 20 minutes. The author also includes a large number of workouts that don't require any fitness equipment. The combination of short workouts that don't require fitness equipment is perfect for the busy person. I can easily grab a quick workout at home before heading to the office.The author has included such a wide variety of workouts that you won't become bored with the same routine day in and day out. The workouts range from beginner to advanced, so there are workouts to suit every level of fitness.As the &#34;WODZILLA: The Ultimate WOD Compilation 700+ Cross Training Workouts&#34; was precisely what I needed I could recommend it highly."
2014-06-24,B00L6JVO40,5.0,Oh my GOD,A2VEHMBK4LD7HE,"First of all this book is STEAMY HOT. Grace is a strong independent woman, and she's SMART. Blake is mysterious and sexy as hell. Put them together and BAM! This book made my glasses steam up. And if you are into classic literature you will definitely catch that this one is a modern day Jane Eyre. But much much sexier!"
2014-07-7,B00L7DRQME,4.0,Secrets and Lies,A1Z3Q1MP35VZUL,"Loved the book, but felt more like I read a chapter and was left hanging. Really wish you would give us at least more of the story rather than wait so long in between. Love the characters so far but frustrated it ended just as I really became involved with them."
2014-07-10,B00L7IGXO6,5.0,Absolute must read!,A3GH9PHBQQQJRJ,This book opened my eyes to the need for a sugar detox. I learned that many of the problems that I had was due to too much sugar consumption and the addictive nature of sugar. I have currently not consumed any sugar for three days and I&#8217;m hoping that I can go for a longer period without intake of sugar; probably even adopt a sugar free lifestyle.
2014-07-1,B00L85OBBU,4.0,Wow perfect title.,A2GBDHBVO5A2YX,"This book was a roller coaster of emotions. I was mad, sad, aggravated, and hopeful throughout the entire story. Aleah has something awful happen to her and instead of her family and friends protecting and sheltering her they turn their backs on her. She is forced to escape her family to stop the abuse and plans they have for her. She has been sheltered her entire life and is now forced to grow up pretty quickly. She is put in an impossible situation and feels that she has no future, but she is saved by a kind elderly gentleman. Things seem to look up for Aleah until his family descends like the vultures they are. Aleah has one of the kindest souls yet others around her crush it on a repeated basis. Just as things seem to be looking up someone kicks her back down. I kept hoping for things to get better for Aleah, because she loves with her whole heart but the people around her don't deserve it. Warning there is a cliffhanger."

It is particularly a motivational book for college students and expats who may be away from home over long periods of time or for the first time. The author explains by making friends, having a optimistic attitude, making friends, eating healthy, and getting ample rest you can overcome being homesick. This book is nothing short for awesomeness! Good book,recommended."

2014-07-19,B00LF3R4WI,4.0,Interesting journey into Submission,A29FFT26RF63YX,"This was a very good book. Not quite into the great category. I was not that into the domming of a women by another woman. Nothing wrong with it, just not MY thing.Also, the over use of 2 words got on my nerves. #1 was Acquiesce. I know this word appears a lot in books of this genre but here it was over used. #2 was was Ooohhh, ohhhh, OOOHHH, and other versions there of. Writer needs a thesaurus to find other usable words. All in all, a decent, insightful book."
2014-07-21,B00LI485VI,5.0,I enjoyed this,A1KQWZZPFNE37C,I read more than my share of paranormal romance. This was a little different. Hannah is in the witness protection a d is brought to Riker for safety. What happens next makes this book so different. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did
2014-07-9,B00LJAL65S,5.0,Aura Balancing,ANOSVLTGRKABQ,This book taught me so much about finding peace in my life in a new way. I found so much information in this book that helped me. I never gave much credence in the whole aura balancing business. But after reading this book and trying it I have to say I am a beiever now. This book is easy to read and so rewarding to do. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking to find peace in their life.
2014-07-23,B00LK5BO1S,5.0,The Viper Queen Strikes,AZRFJMX7PLZOP,"After escaping the Queen Viper&#8217;s hold during one of The Viper Rooms grand party, Joely and Jace manage to start a life together on the run. Moving from place to place, never stopping in one city or country for too long. Their peace seems to be a godsend, and the couple take advantage of the calm. But just when everything seems to be going smoothly, Clara strikes and rips Joely & Jace&#8217;s world to shreds.Back in Clara&#8217;s grasp, Joely has to do one thing&#8230; survive.I love the way we&#8217;re led into this second installment of the Viper series. After the stressful and dangerous game Jace & Joely play with Clara in the first book, it&#8217;s hard to see any type of future for those two. Yet, the start of The Runaway Viper fills the reader with a sense of hope for them. They&#8217;re given a moment to breathe, relax, and not have to constantly be looking over their shoulder. But don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re off the devil&#8217;s radar just yet! There's still that underlying fear and resistance to completely succumb to bliss, because Clara is still out there.Hunting and plotting.I could feel every emotion Joely was going through. I was just as anxious to find out what was going on with the club. I empathized with her when Clara stole her love away. A lot of emotions stir up from this book, and a lot of that emotion is raw and painful to read through. You can&#8217;t help but feel those tragic moments that J&J; spend apart as much as the beautiful seconds they spend together. Every word they speak about each other goes right to the heart.There was a good amount of time where Joely got reacquainted with the pit and I&#8217;m convinced it drove her a bit mad. Things that she said and her reactions weren&#8217;t sensible or beneficial. One scene in particular had me bug-eyed in shock and confused at her feelings toward the situation. I just had issues with the way she acted at times. With the treatment she was being given, who could blame her for going a little bonkers.&#8220;Clara may want me broken, but some parts of me are so impenetrable now, even she won&#8217;t win.&#8221;Overall I really liked the pacing of the novel, though it did seem to drag on a bit in the middle, that just adds to the empathy the reader feels for Joely. There were fast paced moments and then some calm ones.The end left me with a sense of fear. For Clara that is!Jace and co. have something up their sleeves and they&#8217;re not even close to being finished with the Viper Queen. I&#8217;m eagerly anticipating the final showdown for these characters in the third book, The Viper&#8217;s Bite."

2014-07-10,B00LKSYOUS,5.0,This is a solid book based on science and emotion.,A31QY4OKBWOS5G,"It's full of helpful tutorials with pictures to show you the basics. I appreciated the focus on an active sex life as being healthy. So important for relationships! The book explains that taking your time is key and when you think about it, time is something we all have less of. Like anything else, the book shows you how making sex a priority instead of afterthought is key to developing your relationship. The author writes very respectfully towards the reader so I have no problem recommending it."
2014-07-13,B00LLK9SG0,5.0,Great read !! Loved it!!,AUYU7RWJKXQXY,"What a great collection of twisted, dark-humored suspense thrillers!  I was intrigued, enthralled, entertained, freaked out, and laughing.  The stories take you on quite an interesting thrill ride that your imagination will not soon forget.  This book is not for children&#8230; that&#8217;s for sure!  LOL!  But for adults with a warped sadistic sense of humor&#8230; it&#8217;s just what the doctor ordered!  I absolutely loved it!

One wanting to scream it from the roof tops. The other one wants to keep it a secret for their own selfish reasons. It's about 2 people being apart for 8yrs. Now, that they are seeing each other again after so long what comes next? This is my 1st book by Louise Bay. I definitely would read her next.Ava Elliot & Joel Wentworth have never had a easy relationship. They met in college. Ava and Joel had the same group of friends. But, it was there time spent in the library studying that changed everything. They finally gave into temptation after awhile. The funny thing was is that is wasn't Ava making Joel wait. Joel made Ava wait until she knew that this is what she wanted. Joel never hid his feelings for Ava. So, when they finally committed to each other it was for infinity. For forever. So, what's the problem? Ava!! Ava was the problem. Joel wanted to let all their friends know that they were together & happy and in love. Ava on the other hand had a weird way of thinking. She didn't think she was pretty enough for Joel. Ava thought once everybody found out they were together that people would talk Joel into doing better.No matter how much Joel told her he loved her. No matter how much he showed her. It was never enough for Ava. He could never touch her or stand too close to her in public. I felt so bad for Joel. I can not tell you how many times I yelled & cursed at Ava while reading this book! Here she has a man who can legitimately get any woman & is destined to do big things loves her with everything he has. He wants to scream from the highest rooftop that he loves her. Yet, she somehow makes him agree to wait until after her final exam to tell their friends.Now, that finals are a week away Ava is wondering what Joel's plans are after they graduate. All of their friends have said what they are all doing. Ava herself has everything planned out. Everybody has discussed what's next except for Joel. Ava decide's to ask. Joel lets her know he's got this awesome opportunity to go to New York for a year. Joel asks Ava to go with him. To defer school & her internship for the year. After discussing it with her parents she decides to stay.Now, 8yrs later and Joel is moving back to London. Ava has managed for the last 8yrs to avoid Joel every time he's come back to visit their friends. Not only has she managed to avoid Joel like the plague she has also never dated anyone in that time. Ava's life has revolved around work and not much of anything else.Ava has had this imaginary relationship with Joel. Her heart has and always will belong with him. Yet, Ava is afraid his heart is with someone else. Ava talks her friend Jules into getting her on a dating website to get her mind and heart off Joel.Now, with Joel back in town the old gang is back together. They are back to getting together for dinner. Going out to the bars. Yet Ava and Joel never seem to speak to each other except for a &#34;Hello&#34; &#34;How are you&#34; &#34;Good bye&#34; thing. And, that literally drove me insane!!It wasn't until Joel showed up at Ava's doorstep that the present got good. He was there demanding answers. Finally!! He also gave her a time frame. 1 week. Ava had 1 week to prove to him she was ready for a relationship. A public one. Not behind closed doors. But, to let all their friends & anyone else around that they were together. It was all or nothing!I'm so glad the story went back & forth from past and present time frames. It really filled in their complete story. Seeing them falling harder  and harder for each other was nice. Because, they really genuinely did love each other. I just wish Ava wasn't so worried about what everyone else thought and went with her heart. Because, they spent more time either hiding or alone. There was so many unnecessary things with them that never should of happened.I was so pissed from the start of the book to the end of the book in the present time. For the first 72% of the book in the present time that Joel & Ava didn't speak! There was too much description and not enough dialogue. I felt like the book could of used more conversation's between the characters. And, I am sad Ava & Joel didn't get anywhere in the present until 72%.I did love all the characters in this story. I loved how they all remained friends after all these years after they graduated college. They truly did care & love each other. I really hope Louise decides to write another book revolving around one of Ava & Joel's friends. Because, they really are a group of great people."
2014-07-21,B00LTZF72G,4.0,Fun read,A1K17SX0H0F9XX,"**I received a complimentary copy in exchange for a honest review**My star rating: 4/5This was a really fun book.  Emma was intelligent, witty, and relateably insecure...even if she is a little odd.  Her personal journey through the story was gripping.  I loved that we never knew who the water was going to send Emma to deal with next.  Abby was my favorite secondary character for sure; she allowed us to really see the depth of Emma's nurturing spirit.  Ms. Noser's writing was clean, though more on the young adult level than new adult.  College life was explored thoroughly, an area typically left lacking in paranormal new adults, which I loved.  I will say there probably could have been a half-dozen or so less chapters.  There was a lot of filler that I found myself skipping over.Mary BernsenAuthor of Healing The Bayou and The Villain's Love Series"
2014-07-22,B00LU2DW0M,5.0,Amazingly Sweet Story,A3A6C58USZGUY6,"Shy of Tomorrow is an amazingly beautiful read. Love the characters,  the storyline...there was nothing about the story I did not like. Kylee, the shy librarian kinda reminded me of how I use to be shy when it came to relationships and dealing with the opposite sex. This is a highly recommend story if you like a sweet read. Looking forward to reading more from this author."
2014-07-21,B00LWBR25M,5.0,I need more now!!!,A3KLGF74NCV3P1,I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.I absolutely loved this book.  I love all of Scarlett Dawn&#8217;s work.  This book was very easy-to-read.  I didn&#8217;t have any problems with the new world and the different species.  My heart broke for both Braita and Jax when they were chosen to go to the planet of the Mian&#8217;s.  They were basically sent to be slaves after a tsunami wiped out there city on the planet they escaped to when the Earth fell.  I felt so much anxiety not knowing what would happen to them.  I hated their President for failing to tell them the terms of their new lives.  I was relieved when Braita started her new life with Leo and Malik.  I just knew they&#8217;d take care of her.  I never saw the ending coming.  Not one bit.  Oh My Gawd!!!  How could you do that to me Scarlett?  And now I have to wait how long for the next book?  At least I can look forward to King Tomb coming October 8th.5-BombsReviewed by Tracy
