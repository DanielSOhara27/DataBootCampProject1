I usually get the super cheap Chandra i think its called, from a store with a red bullseye but oddly, they think people only wear slippers at Christmas so if yours wear out, you have to wait until November for your size to be widely available (7-7.5).  These are almost the same shoe, with the same strong support and bottom, same cushioned feel, good looking and accurate sizing- at 3x\'s the sale price of the Chandra ($8). The sole is not as thick as the Chandra but it doesn\'t seem to effect the support quality so it\'s okay. But my feet have been killing me from my old slippers having no more support left so I couldn\'t wait any longer.Bought a size 7 (I get the other in 7.5) - these fit perfectly except I would rather have the half size bigger for my thick furry socks. But they still can be worn with my socks so it works just fine. Accurate sizing matters - I tried Isotoner in a 7.5-8 and my foot hung off the back and the regular was so narrow, there was no fitting it with anything but a bare foot and then they were still much too short, not anywhere close to what is considered \"standard\" 7-7.5 much less 7.5-8 which should be too big on my 7 foot. So sizing should give them a bonus star for being a size that I typically would wear in any shoe.

So I ordered this one January this year, and more than half a year later of usage, I\'m a bit iffy on the quality.The belt itself is sturdy, made of clear plastic that isn\'t flimsy, which I liked. Based on other reviews about this belt I agree that it has a little bulge on the adjustment loop portion -- but to me that\'s not much of an issue, as I don\'t wear super-fit shirts anyway (I wear it more so to remediate the gaping waistline issue), but I can see how that poses a problem to people who want to wear fitted shirts over it.The buckles and adjustment loops are strong enough. I do wish they have this in a more \"translucent\" plastic, as during my usage the indigo jeans tend to bleed out and stain the edges of this belt, so it\'s not so \"invisible\" anymore when you use it on khakis (or maybe get the black one to wear it with dark jeans -- I just wanted to get the clear one expecting it to be flexible for dark and light pants).The main reason why I\'m saying it\'s \"just OK\" is that while I do not wear the belt frequently the past 6 months (not all of my pants need the belt), the stitching that holds the buckle is not too strong. Right now the stitching is starting to snap off bit by bit and I\'m pretty sure it\'s not going to last on the next wear. I am not  even putting stress on it (I don\'t force my belt too tightly) -- I\'d say that they need to improve the quality of the stitching -- maybe make a double parallel stitch rather than just one?Anyhow, there aren\'t really better options that I like out there for \"invisible belts\" so I\'m going to give Invisibelt another chance. Hopefully my 2nd one lasts longer.','I812812559'),(90,'2013-12-30',5,'Love it!','[[\'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry\', \'Women\', \'Clothing\', \'Tops & Tees\', \'Blouses & Button-Down Shirts\']]','This shirt was a good fit for me.

I guess I should have known, but you can\'t tell by looking at the picture.Another disappointment is the diamond accent.  I thought it would be in the middle of the sapphire, that makes sense.. I knew the top and bottom would be polished silver, but no it\'s at the bottom of the main sapphire and it\'s NOT centered.  It looks awkward off to the side.. that is if you can even tell it is there.The ring doesn\'t fit in my jewelry box either due to it\'s size, I guess I should have thought about that.Given being able to do it again, I would give it some major thought and might still do it because it matches a bracelet I bought off here, but I would have given so much for it ($35).','I873283863'),(238,'2014-01-26',5,'Super Cute!','[[\'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry\', \'Women\', \'Clothing\', \'Dresses\', \'Night Out & Cocktail\'], [\'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry\', \'Women\', \'Petite\', \'Dresses\', \'Night Out & Cocktail\']]','I really liked this dress its super cute!

This happened with all 4 of the sizes, so I think it\'s an issue of the make vs personal fit.Also, this definitely gives you a 50s torpedo shape to your bustline. Even with the underwire issue, it was pretty and priced well enough that I considered keeping it ... until I put on a shirt and looked in the mirror. Everything was very high, separated, and pointy.

I am thick through the waist, hips and thighs. The 512 and 542 Levi\'s styles are the most comfortable for my shape.  The sizing is unpredictable/inconsistent so if you don\'t have the patience to deal with that inconvenience then you may want to seek a different brand.  For me, no other brand compares.  I ordered 3 pairs of this style in the same size but all different colors.  Two pairs measured 37&#34;-38&#34; in the waist - perfect.  One pair (unscripted) measured 34&#34; in the waist - too small.  Other than the sizing issues, these jeans are very comfortable.  They hug in a way that looks good on a plus size woman.  The back pockets are positioned perfectly. The tummy panel is great with one exception - very shallow front pockets.  I carry nothing important in the front pockets because they are so shallow. That\'s not really an issue for me as don\'t carry things in my pockets anyway.  In the rare need for pockets, the back pockets are my choice. They are boot cut but not too wide as is the case with many other boot cut jeans.  I don\'t like the flare leg look nor do I like the skinny leg look. I simply love these jeans!!Regarding my experience with sizing:Being a repeat Levi\'s customer for 30+ years; I have noticed what seems to be a trend depending on where the jeans were made. First, let me emphasize that when these were made exclusively in the USA, I wore the 550 style and I never encountered erratic sizing issues to the point of &#34;doesn\'t fit at all&#34; that I sometimes encounter now.  As with most clothing brands, they started manufacturing in other countries in order to compete and to stay in business.  When ordered in my normal size:-Made in China runs between too small to perfect sizing.-Made in Pakistan runs between perfect sizing to too large.-I have never received jeans made in China that were too large and I have never received jeans made in Pakistan that were too small.-Made in Pakistan is more often perfect sizing than those Made in China. (In my recent order, 2 pairs from Pakistan fit perfect while one pair from China was too small)OK, I know that may not be very helpful but I wanted to share it because this explains why one reviewer states; these jeans are too small, the next reviewer states; these jeans are too big, and then the next reviewer states; I should have just ordered my normal size.  In my experience I find it is best to just order my normal size because I win more often that way.  Notice that I said more often, not always. It is most probable that hundreds of happy customers order their normal size and simply do not bother to write reviews.','I021185366'),(334,'2013-01-28',3,'Not what I thought I ordered','[[\'Sports & Outdoors\', \'Clothing\', \'Men\', \'Socks\'], [\'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry\', \'Men\', \'Clothing\', \'Active\', \'Athletic Socks\'], [\'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry\', \'Men\', \'Big & Tall\']]','This is not the product I thought I had ordered.

The numbers are large and easy to read against the black background and the movement of the hands is quite smooth.  Only thing he wishes it had was some really nice lume.The watch strap is about as comfortable as you can get ad doesn\'t slip around on the wrist.

Some people said it looks costume-ish, but I personally disagree.  I find the asymmetrical layers to be very pretty and adds nice, classy length.

The picture is very accurate as to what the dress will look like.  The only thing is that it\'s a bit long.  I fixed that by trimming one of the layers, and then it looked nice.  I love this dress, and I think it could work for events, weddings, or maybe even casual with the right shoes.  I love it, and for the price, I couldn\'t ask for better.  If you want something that looks expensive and is extremely classy and foolproof, you\'ll have to spend more than $50.

So why am I posting a review now?Because I received a superior service from Timex that warrants a write-up.After years of faithful service the wrist band on the Ironman watch came off on one side. I looked up where I can find a replacement and found that Timex will replace the band on its watches for free.I called the 800 number and sure enough, they told me to package it up, write a note that it is for band replacement only, told me to enclose a check for a very modest shipping cost to send it back to me. Four weeks later  and my watch arrived back: new band and the back looks shinier. Looks like they cleaned its exterior as well.This has been one of my favorite watches1) I like the nice clear large display. Easy to see even with my now presbyopic eyes.2) Setting the watch is easy without a manual3) There is enough useful features, but not so many that the it makes it too complex to do simple things4) Even though it is a men\'s watch I a female who wear is and I don\'t find it heavy or bulky5) I like the plastic watch band. My previous Timex had a Velcro band and eventually it picked up a lot of lint it did not close well. And now that I found that Timex will replace it for a cost of shipping it back, I am even more pleased with it.6) The battery lasts a reasonable time, I have to replace it every 2-3 years. Not often enough to be annoying. The battery in my \"dressed-up\" watch lasts only a year.I am very pleased with the watch, and now extremely pleased with the service as well.Ali Julia review','I839144576'),(664,'2014-04-18',5,'like','[[\'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry\', \'Women\', \'Shoes\', \'Flats\']]','this is a great shoe to wear with anything.  feels comfortable and dressy look on with any dress or slacks','I192300805'),(665,'2014-07-08',5,'The blue is amazing','[[\'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry\', \'Women\', \'Clothing\', \'Tops & Tees\', \'Knits & Tees\']]','Got the blue one and the blue really pops.

And once it was fastened, I felt like it was cutting off circulation! I returned it. The 34B fits as expected. Very comfortable so far. I have only used it for a couple short 6 mile runs, and there were no irritations or hot spots. The real test will be when I run more than 13 miles in it. That seems to be when any irritations occur. It is a bit of a struggle to put on. The trick is to keep the top latch in the back fastened, and then put it on like a tank top. Then I am able to get the lower back hooks fastened without too much trouble.

I am lucky that I can afford to spent thousands on shoes to find the right shoe and I have purchase all if not most of the major brands.

When I exercise in them they hold my foot in a neutral position and I don\'t over pronate which is a sign of quality for someone with rubbish feet like myself.In my opinion the true test of a shoe is not how shoes function with good feet, its how they function with people was bad feet.

The shoes do run a bit small; I ended up with an 8.5 when I normally wear 8s (or 39s in the Vibrams).The sole tread seems more stable on wet/slippery surfaces than the tread pattern on the vibram shoes, and these shoes do not chafe if you manage to get caught in a deluge; the downside is that these shoes take days to dry out if they get soaked. (so, great *in* rain, but long recovery.) No pressure on my achilles, and no real break-in required. v2 is definitely lighter than the original, which is amazing to me.Downsides: the sole is very soft, and will wear fairly quickly.

If you don\'t already have the perfect athletic body you might want to think about getting a size up. I  got the XXL even though I most often take an XL but in this case the shirt that is meant to be form fitted is a wee bit tight and does not flatter any less than perfect figure flaws, rather it highlights the extra tire. The cut of the shirt will still give the form fitting look but might give you some leverage in the not so pretty areas.

They are a little bouncier than most flip flops found in the U.S. Surprisingly so for the thin-ness of the sole. I find this makes walking in them for any distance, and I live in a city, alot less stressful on the heels than other flops I wear with such thin soles.  The straps that hold your foot to the flop are more V like than many other designs of the typicall flop, so I don\'t get scratched up by them as much as on other types of flops.  The rubber is also fairly soft in comparison to the typical injection molded cheapo flop. They run small for a US 12-13, very small.  I have a size 11.5 foot and 12 is usually pretty large on me, these were actually somewhat small, so be aware of that when ordering.  My toe comes right to the edge with my heel only having about 1/4 of an inch or less of space from the back of the flop and again, I\'m an 11.5 and these are rated 12/14 M. So these run small and narrow.One word of caution, however: One common problem with Havianas is that like flip flops from the 70s, the toe part that clips into the bottom of the shoe will slip loose as they wear.  So don\'t run in them, as this may happen while you are running and you could trip.  I will attach a photo of what I mean.  This tends to happen to me if I do more than just very casually walk in this type of flop or if the ground is really hot as it gets here in DC in the summer on the roads.','I620694861'),(1028,'2012-01-12',5,'Perfect Thermals','[[\'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry\', \'C\', \'Carhartt\'], [\'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry\', \'Men\', \'Clothing\', \'Underwear\', \'Thermal Underwear\', \'Bottoms\'], [\'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry\', \'Men\', \'Big & Tall\']]','I bought these for my husband for our trip to the mountains in GA for Christams.

That makes them bulky and loose and all bunched up and uncomfortable under your pants. Also they are a heavier thicker cotton and feel too hot in the summer. When they get sweaty and then hold the moisture It\'s like having a wet facecloth in your crotch.

Out of the packaging, it looked very small, and I was nervous if these were going to fit on me at all.  At first these felt like a tight panty hoose.  They stretch pretty easily.  These are thicker than normal panty hose so its not like you will rip it if you pull on it to put it on.  The top of the Spanx sits right below my breast line. It sucks everything in pretty good.  I probably reduced at least 2-3 inches off of my waist. I wore this under a tight long dress that was hugging my body and no lines were shown.  :)  super happy!  After wearing this for about 15-30 minutes, I forgot that I was wearing anything underneath at all.  It felt so comfortable.  Most other shapewears are extremely uncomfortable and feels so tight.

One is that the bands are pretty stiff.  I\'m sure that as I wear each one more, they will soften up, but right now they pretty inflexible and so not as comfortable to wear right out of the box as I would have liked.  The second negative is that the pin that pulls out to set the time is really hard to pull out, and, because it is smooth and doesn\'t have ridges on it, it is hard to spin to set the time.

Plus, some info on Icebreaker wool weights, ranges, and sizing','[[\'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry\', \'Women\', \'Clothing\', \'Active\', \'Active Base Layers\']]','I have had this kind of Icebreaker Oasis shirt before, and last week I decided to order another one in a color that matches some new leggings that I ordered.Unfortunately, in my usual Icebreaker size, size small, the chest area of the new Oasis shirt was too tight, which I\'ve not experienced in my other Icebreaker tops.Also, the sleeves of this new shirt were FOUR INCHES too long, 4 inches past my wrist.  Now, most of my Icebreaker shirts have sleeves that are a bit too long for me, often up to 2 inches too long, but 4 inches is something else entirely.  Some Icebreaker tops have thumb loops and are supposed to be 2 inches past the wrist so the thumbs can fit into them, but this top didn\'t even have thumb loops and is meant to finish at the wrist.I had to return this top.  The medium might fit me better in the chest area, but would be even longer in the arms and too big in shoulders/tummy area, so I didn\'t go up a size.I would give the specific top I returned 2 stars, but I went up to 3 for this review because maybe that top was a one-off factory mistake or something.-----------Some general info on Icebreaker:Because some of Amazon\'s listing descriptions for Icebreaker items have very few details about the products, making it difficult for the customer to make an informed purchasing decision if he/she is unfamiliar with this brand of clothing, below I\'ll type some information and personal impressions about Icebreaker clothing.Note that my review is quite long and usually only the first half of it is shown on this page. If this happens on your screen and you wish to read the second half, all you have to do is press the \"read more\" button at the bottom of the review and Amazon will show you the rest of it.  :-)----------------------OVERALL IMPRESSIONIcebreaker\'s marino wool items are generally made well, last a long time, are easy to care for, feel fantastic on the skin, are \"natural\", don\'t get smelly easily like polarfleece does, let the skin breathe, etc.Many of my Icebreaker items have been worn and washed several hundred times and are still holding up much better than would be expected.I am a BIG fan of this company\'s products.  For my overall experience of them from around 2000-2010, I would give them a solid \"5 stars\"!However, I regret to say that my opinion of the items I have bought from Icebreaker in 2012 is not as high.  In the last 2 weeks (late 2012), I have bought 7 items from them and I decided to return all of them because they aren\'t as well-cut as the very \"same\" items that I bought in the 2000s (which I still have and wear, so I can make like-for-like comparisons easily).Based solely on my 2012 experience of Icebreaker products, I would give them 3 stars, \"it\'s ok\".  For me, this is not good enough to command prices of $50 - $100+ for quite simple items, even if the basic wool material itself is outstanding and long-lasting.---------------------MY EXPERIENCE WITH ICEBREAKERI bought my first Icebreaker clothing about 13 years ago when I needed some long underwear for skiing.Up until about 6 years ago, I had been buying Icebreaker items very sparingly, due to the eye-watering prices at London UK sporting goods shops .  Then, I discovered that Sierratradingpost sells various Icebreaker styles (usually discontinued items from years past) on their site for a discount. Fortunately, for a couple of years after I discovered this, they had a large selection of women\'s Icebreaker stuff, so I bought quite a few things for great prices. (These days, Sierra\'s Icebreaker selection for women appears to be smaller, and the prices comparatively higher, than before.  I expect that there are more discounters they have to compete with now, to get that kind of stock.)In addition to bricks-and-mortar sports shops and Sierratradingpost, I have also bought Icebreaker items from several sporting goods online retailers, Amazon, and the Icebreaker website.I still have almost every Icebreaker item I\'ve bought.  Even the discounted items have been somewhat pricey, but the quality and longevity were worth the initial investment.In the last two weeks, I have tried to replace a few of my key Icebreaker items but found the fit and cut of the current versions of the same items to be sub-par.  I will keep using my old items for another year, and hope that next year\'s fit and cut will be better-suited to my','I012041121'),(1150,'2013-12-10',5,'perfect little flats','[[\'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry\', \'Women\', \'Shoes\', \'Flats\']]','Love these flats!

This, of course is the end of my sleep for this night.  I\'ve tried taking every nutrient known to mankind, and nothing helped.So, I decided to try these soft leg warmers.  I already knew I would like the fabric because I have socks and scarves made of it. It feels so luxurious.  The thing I wasn\'t sure of was whether I could actually sleep in them because my skin is so sensitive, and I thought after a while they might itch, but I\'ve had them for about 3 weeks, and I\'ve slept peacefully throughout (most) nights. My sleep has improved about 90%. They\'re long enough that when nights are cold, I can slip them right down to cover my feet as well, so I\'m warm all the way from my knees to my toes.I think maybe they should come in sizes.  I considered getting some for my mom who also deals with night cramps, but I don\'t think they would fit her legs because they\'re quite a bit larger than mine. I\'m 5\'2\" and weight 129 lbs, and these fit perfectly.  In another review, someone said hers immediately got a hole in them. They come with a tag attached with a plastic strip run through the fabric.  Clip that strip carefully; if you jerk it out of the fabric, you\'re almost assured to get a hole in the area where it was pulled through.

The extender might be handy for those with thicker wrists but I have mine closed on the tightest link anyway.It is fairly heavy on the wrist so if you dislike heavy bracelets you might want to steer clear of it. There is some jingle to it since the beads are free moving and they do tend to slip under your wrist when typing so that might be a consideration for a work day.The biggest con I can think of for this item is that the chain the beads are on is a spring design and easily catches and pulls the fine hairs at the wrist.

These shorts include the Pearl Izumi Men\'s Liner Short which can be purchased separately.  The shorts are reasonably priced when you consider the cost of the liners.The material is light but stays in place as you ride.  The amount of material is not skintight nor saggy & rarely gets caught on my saddle.  The single zippered pocket is ample enough to hold a medium wallet (located on the lower portion of the right leg)  Edit:  The single, limited pocket is the worst of these shorts.  More pockets in other locations would have been very desirable.  Limit what you carry or store stuff elsewhere with these.The elastic waistband adjusts with several buttons on each side of the shorts.  A pair of loops inside the waistband clip to the short liners (to avoid sagging?) I purchased a medium size for an approx. 35\" waist and only a minor adjustment to the waistband was needed.  Edit:  Check the other reviews for sizing advice.  Some say the shorts run a bit large.The padded liner portion of the shorts are definitely the highlight of the product and I suggest you check out those independent reviews (search Pearl Izumi Men\'s Liner Short).  The existing user reviews on the liners are very clear and constructive.  I will be purchasing more of the liners in the near future - they work well with other shorts.','I144804904'),(1269,'2012-10-30',5,'So adorable!','[[\'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry\', \'L\', \'Leg Avenue\'], [\'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry\', \'Women\', \'Petite\'], [\'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry\', \'Novelty, Costumes & More\']]','This product was perfect!

By occasional, I mean rarely. My foot would maybe hurt about 5 minutes or so when walking barefoot in the morning and most days not at all. Well, after wearing these shoes, I now suffer from severe plantar fasciitis. (I am not accusing the company of this, I just find it quite a coincidence that immediately after wearing the shoes this occurred.)I wore them 2 or 3 days for a couple hours at a time and then the foot pain started. My foot hurt with every little step. Even with the support of New Balance my foot still hurts (read: shooting pain). Right now, as I am writing this, my foot is in great pain. I now can only wear my Birkenstocks and I still feel the severe pain with those as well. I hope over time this painful affliction goes away, but right now I am quite disappointed in Skechers.
