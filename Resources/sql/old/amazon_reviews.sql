I usually get the super cheap Chandra i think its called, from a store with a red bullseye but oddly, they think people only wear slippers at Christmas so if yours wear out, you have to wait until November for your size to be widely available (7-7.5).  These are almost the same shoe, with the same strong support and bottom, same cushioned feel, good looking and accurate sizing- at 3x\'s the sale price of the Chandra ($8). The sole is not as thick as the Chandra but it doesn\'t seem to effect the support quality so it\'s okay. But my feet have been killing me from my old slippers having no more support left so I couldn\'t wait any longer.Bought a size 7 (I get the other in 7.5) - these fit perfectly except I would rather have the half size bigger for my thick furry socks. But they still can be worn with my socks so it works just fine. Accurate sizing matters - I tried Isotoner in a 7.5-8 and my foot hung off the back and the regular was so narrow, there was no fitting it with anything but a bare foot and then they were still much too short, not anywhere close to what is considered \"standard\" 7-7.5 much less 7.5-8 which should be too big on my 7 foot. So sizing should give them a bonus star for being a size that I typically would wear in any shoe.

So I ordered this one January this year, and more than half a year later of usage, I\'m a bit iffy on the quality.The belt itself is sturdy, made of clear plastic that isn\'t flimsy, which I liked. Based on other reviews about this belt I agree that it has a little bulge on the adjustment loop portion -- but to me that\'s not much of an issue, as I don\'t wear super-fit shirts anyway (I wear it more so to remediate the gaping waistline issue), but I can see how that poses a problem to people who want to wear fitted shirts over it.The buckles and adjustment loops are strong enough. I do wish they have this in a more \"translucent\" plastic, as during my usage the indigo jeans tend to bleed out and stain the edges of this belt, so it\'s not so \"invisible\" anymore when you use it on khakis (or maybe get the black one to wear it with dark jeans -- I just wanted to get the clear one expecting it to be flexible for dark and light pants).The main reason why I\'m saying it\'s \"just OK\" is that while I do not wear the belt frequently the past 6 months (not all of my pants need the belt), the stitching that holds the buckle is not too strong. Right now the stitching is starting to snap off bit by bit and I\'m pretty sure it\'s not going to last on the next wear. I am not  even putting stress on it (I don\'t force my belt too tightly) -- I\'d say that they need to improve the quality of the stitching -- maybe make a double parallel stitch rather than just one?Anyhow, there aren\'t really better options that I like out there for \"invisible belts\" so I\'m going to give Invisibelt another chance. Hopefully my 2nd one lasts longer.','I812812559'),(90,'2013-12-30',5,'Love it!','[[\'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry\', \'Women\', \'Clothing\', \'Tops & Tees\', \'Blouses & Button-Down Shirts\']]','This shirt was a good fit for me.

I guess I should have known, but you can\'t tell by looking at the picture.Another disappointment is the diamond accent.  I thought it would be in the middle of the sapphire, that makes sense.. I knew the top and bottom would be polished silver, but no it\'s at the bottom of the main sapphire and it\'s NOT centered.  It looks awkward off to the side.. that is if you can even tell it is there.The ring doesn\'t fit in my jewelry box either due to it\'s size, I guess I should have thought about that.Given being able to do it again, I would give it some major thought and might still do it because it matches a bracelet I bought off here, but I would have given so much for it ($35).','I873283863'),(238,'2014-01-26',5,'Super Cute!','[[\'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry\', \'Women\', \'Clothing\', \'Dresses\', \'Night Out & Cocktail\'], [\'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry\', \'Women\', \'Petite\', \'Dresses\', \'Night Out & Cocktail\']]','I really liked this dress its super cute!

This happened with all 4 of the sizes, so I think it\'s an issue of the make vs personal fit.Also, this definitely gives you a 50s torpedo shape to your bustline. Even with the underwire issue, it was pretty and priced well enough that I considered keeping it ... until I put on a shirt and looked in the mirror. Everything was very high, separated, and pointy.

I am thick through the waist, hips and thighs. The 512 and 542 Levi\'s styles are the most comfortable for my shape.  The sizing is unpredictable/inconsistent so if you don\'t have the patience to deal with that inconvenience then you may want to seek a different brand.  For me, no other brand compares.  I ordered 3 pairs of this style in the same size but all different colors.  Two pairs measured 37&#34;-38&#34; in the waist - perfect.  One pair (unscripted) measured 34&#34; in the waist - too small.  Other than the sizing issues, these jeans are very comfortable.  They hug in a way that looks good on a plus size woman.  The back pockets are positioned perfectly. The tummy panel is great with one exception - very shallow front pockets.  I carry nothing important in the front pockets because they are so shallow. That\'s not really an issue for me as don\'t carry things in my pockets anyway.  In the rare need for pockets, the back pockets are my choice. They are boot cut but not too wide as is the case with many other boot cut jeans.  I don\'t like the flare leg look nor do I like the skinny leg look. I simply love these jeans!!Regarding my experience with sizing:Being a repeat Levi\'s customer for 30+ years; I have noticed what seems to be a trend depending on where the jeans were made. First, let me emphasize that when these were made exclusively in the USA, I wore the 550 style and I never encountered erratic sizing issues to the point of &#34;doesn\'t fit at all&#34; that I sometimes encounter now.  As with most clothing brands, they started manufacturing in other countries in order to compete and to stay in business.  When ordered in my normal size:-Made in China runs between too small to perfect sizing.-Made in Pakistan runs between perfect sizing to too large.-I have never received jeans made in China that were too large and I have never received jeans made in Pakistan that were too small.-Made in Pakistan is more often perfect sizing than those Made in China. (In my recent order, 2 pairs from Pakistan fit perfect while one pair from China was too small)OK, I know that may not be very helpful but I wanted to share it because this explains why one reviewer states; these jeans are too small, the next reviewer states; these jeans are too big, and then the next reviewer states; I should have just ordered my normal size.  In my experience I find it is best to just order my normal size because I win more often that way.  Notice that I said more often, not always. It is most probable that hundreds of happy customers order their normal size and simply do not bother to write reviews.','I021185366'),(334,'2013-01-28',3,'Not what I thought I ordered','[[\'Sports & Outdoors\', \'Clothing\', \'Men\', \'Socks\'], [\'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry\', \'Men\', \'Clothing\', \'Active\', \'Athletic Socks\'], [\'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry\', \'Men\', \'Big & Tall\']]','This is not the product I thought I had ordered.

The numbers are large and easy to read against the black background and the movement of the hands is quite smooth.  Only thing he wishes it had was some really nice lume.The watch strap is about as comfortable as you can get ad doesn\'t slip around on the wrist.

Some people said it looks costume-ish, but I personally disagree.  I find the asymmetrical layers to be very pretty and adds nice, classy length.

The picture is very accurate as to what the dress will look like.  The only thing is that it\'s a bit long.  I fixed that by trimming one of the layers, and then it looked nice.  I love this dress, and I think it could work for events, weddings, or maybe even casual with the right shoes.  I love it, and for the price, I couldn\'t ask for better.  If you want something that looks expensive and is extremely classy and foolproof, you\'ll have to spend more than $50.

So why am I posting a review now?Because I received a superior service from Timex that warrants a write-up.After years of faithful service the wrist band on the Ironman watch came off on one side. I looked up where I can find a replacement and found that Timex will replace the band on its watches for free.I called the 800 number and sure enough, they told me to package it up, write a note that it is for band replacement only, told me to enclose a check for a very modest shipping cost to send it back to me. Four weeks later  and my watch arrived back: new band and the back looks shinier. Looks like they cleaned its exterior as well.This has been one of my favorite watches1) I like the nice clear large display. Easy to see even with my now presbyopic eyes.2) Setting the watch is easy without a manual3) There is enough useful features, but not so many that the it makes it too complex to do simple things4) Even though it is a men\'s watch I a female who wear is and I don\'t find it heavy or bulky5) I like the plastic watch band. My previous Timex had a Velcro band and eventually it picked up a lot of lint it did not close well. And now that I found that Timex will replace it for a cost of shipping it back, I am even more pleased with it.6) The battery lasts a reasonable time, I have to replace it every 2-3 years. Not often enough to be annoying. The battery in my \"dressed-up\" watch lasts only a year.I am very pleased with the watch, and now extremely pleased with the service as well.Ali Julia review','I839144576'),(664,'2014-04-18',5,'like','[[\'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry\', \'Women\', \'Shoes\', \'Flats\']]','this is a great shoe to wear with anything.  feels comfortable and dressy look on with any dress or slacks','I192300805'),(665,'2014-07-08',5,'The blue is amazing','[[\'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry\', \'Women\', \'Clothing\', \'Tops & Tees\', \'Knits & Tees\']]','Got the blue one and the blue really pops.

And once it was fastened, I felt like it was cutting off circulation! I returned it. The 34B fits as expected. Very comfortable so far. I have only used it for a couple short 6 mile runs, and there were no irritations or hot spots. The real test will be when I run more than 13 miles in it. That seems to be when any irritations occur. It is a bit of a struggle to put on. The trick is to keep the top latch in the back fastened, and then put it on like a tank top. Then I am able to get the lower back hooks fastened without too much trouble.

I am lucky that I can afford to spent thousands on shoes to find the right shoe and I have purchase all if not most of the major brands.

When I exercise in them they hold my foot in a neutral position and I don\'t over pronate which is a sign of quality for someone with rubbish feet like myself.In my opinion the true test of a shoe is not how shoes function with good feet, its how they function with people was bad feet.

The shoes do run a bit small; I ended up with an 8.5 when I normally wear 8s (or 39s in the Vibrams).The sole tread seems more stable on wet/slippery surfaces than the tread pattern on the vibram shoes, and these shoes do not chafe if you manage to get caught in a deluge; the downside is that these shoes take days to dry out if they get soaked. (so, great *in* rain, but long recovery.) No pressure on my achilles, and no real break-in required. v2 is definitely lighter than the original, which is amazing to me.Downsides: the sole is very soft, and will wear fairly quickly.

If you don\'t already have the perfect athletic body you might want to think about getting a size up. I  got the XXL even though I most often take an XL but in this case the shirt that is meant to be form fitted is a wee bit tight and does not flatter any less than perfect figure flaws, rather it highlights the extra tire. The cut of the shirt will still give the form fitting look but might give you some leverage in the not so pretty areas.

They are a little bouncier than most flip flops found in the U.S. Surprisingly so for the thin-ness of the sole. I find this makes walking in them for any distance, and I live in a city, alot less stressful on the heels than other flops I wear with such thin soles.  The straps that hold your foot to the flop are more V like than many other designs of the typicall flop, so I don\'t get scratched up by them as much as on other types of flops.  The rubber is also fairly soft in comparison to the typical injection molded cheapo flop. They run small for a US 12-13, very small.  I have a size 11.5 foot and 12 is usually pretty large on me, these were actually somewhat small, so be aware of that when ordering.  My toe comes right to the edge with my heel only having about 1/4 of an inch or less of space from the back of the flop and again, I\'m an 11.5 and these are rated 12/14 M. So these run small and narrow.One word of caution, however: One common problem with Havianas is that like flip flops from the 70s, the toe part that clips into the bottom of the shoe will slip loose as they wear.  So don\'t run in them, as this may happen while you are running and you could trip.  I will attach a photo of what I mean.  This tends to happen to me if I do more than just very casually walk in this type of flop or if the ground is really hot as it gets here in DC in the summer on the roads.','I620694861'),(1028,'2012-01-12',5,'Perfect Thermals','[[\'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry\', \'C\', \'Carhartt\'], [\'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry\', \'Men\', \'Clothing\', \'Underwear\', \'Thermal Underwear\', \'Bottoms\'], [\'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry\', \'Men\', \'Big & Tall\']]','I bought these for my husband for our trip to the mountains in GA for Christams.

That makes them bulky and loose and all bunched up and uncomfortable under your pants. Also they are a heavier thicker cotton and feel too hot in the summer. When they get sweaty and then hold the moisture It\'s like having a wet facecloth in your crotch.

Out of the packaging, it looked very small, and I was nervous if these were going to fit on me at all.  At first these felt like a tight panty hoose.  They stretch pretty easily.  These are thicker than normal panty hose so its not like you will rip it if you pull on it to put it on.  The top of the Spanx sits right below my breast line. It sucks everything in pretty good.  I probably reduced at least 2-3 inches off of my waist. I wore this under a tight long dress that was hugging my body and no lines were shown.  :)  super happy!  After wearing this for about 15-30 minutes, I forgot that I was wearing anything underneath at all.  It felt so comfortable.  Most other shapewears are extremely uncomfortable and feels so tight.

One is that the bands are pretty stiff.  I\'m sure that as I wear each one more, they will soften up, but right now they pretty inflexible and so not as comfortable to wear right out of the box as I would have liked.  The second negative is that the pin that pulls out to set the time is really hard to pull out, and, because it is smooth and doesn\'t have ridges on it, it is hard to spin to set the time.

Plus, some info on Icebreaker wool weights, ranges, and sizing','[[\'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry\', \'Women\', \'Clothing\', \'Active\', \'Active Base Layers\']]','I have had this kind of Icebreaker Oasis shirt before, and last week I decided to order another one in a color that matches some new leggings that I ordered.Unfortunately, in my usual Icebreaker size, size small, the chest area of the new Oasis shirt was too tight, which I\'ve not experienced in my other Icebreaker tops.Also, the sleeves of this new shirt were FOUR INCHES too long, 4 inches past my wrist.  Now, most of my Icebreaker shirts have sleeves that are a bit too long for me, often up to 2 inches too long, but 4 inches is something else entirely.  Some Icebreaker tops have thumb loops and are supposed to be 2 inches past the wrist so the thumbs can fit into them, but this top didn\'t even have thumb loops and is meant to finish at the wrist.I had to return this top.  The medium might fit me better in the chest area, but would be even longer in the arms and too big in shoulders/tummy area, so I didn\'t go up a size.I would give the specific top I returned 2 stars, but I went up to 3 for this review because maybe that top was a one-off factory mistake or something.-----------Some general info on Icebreaker:Because some of Amazon\'s listing descriptions for Icebreaker items have very few details about the products, making it difficult for the customer to make an informed purchasing decision if he/she is unfamiliar with this brand of clothing, below I\'ll type some information and personal impressions about Icebreaker clothing.Note that my review is quite long and usually only the first half of it is shown on this page. If this happens on your screen and you wish to read the second half, all you have to do is press the \"read more\" button at the bottom of the review and Amazon will show you the rest of it.  :-)----------------------OVERALL IMPRESSIONIcebreaker\'s marino wool items are generally made well, last a long time, are easy to care for, feel fantastic on the skin, are \"natural\", don\'t get smelly easily like polarfleece does, let the skin breathe, etc.Many of my Icebreaker items have been worn and washed several hundred times and are still holding up much better than would be expected.I am a BIG fan of this company\'s products.  For my overall experience of them from around 2000-2010, I would give them a solid \"5 stars\"!However, I regret to say that my opinion of the items I have bought from Icebreaker in 2012 is not as high.  In the last 2 weeks (late 2012), I have bought 7 items from them and I decided to return all of them because they aren\'t as well-cut as the very \"same\" items that I bought in the 2000s (which I still have and wear, so I can make like-for-like comparisons easily).Based solely on my 2012 experience of Icebreaker products, I would give them 3 stars, \"it\'s ok\".  For me, this is not good enough to command prices of $50 - $100+ for quite simple items, even if the basic wool material itself is outstanding and long-lasting.---------------------MY EXPERIENCE WITH ICEBREAKERI bought my first Icebreaker clothing about 13 years ago when I needed some long underwear for skiing.Up until about 6 years ago, I had been buying Icebreaker items very sparingly, due to the eye-watering prices at London UK sporting goods shops .  Then, I discovered that Sierratradingpost sells various Icebreaker styles (usually discontinued items from years past) on their site for a discount. Fortunately, for a couple of years after I discovered this, they had a large selection of women\'s Icebreaker stuff, so I bought quite a few things for great prices. (These days, Sierra\'s Icebreaker selection for women appears to be smaller, and the prices comparatively higher, than before.  I expect that there are more discounters they have to compete with now, to get that kind of stock.)In addition to bricks-and-mortar sports shops and Sierratradingpost, I have also bought Icebreaker items from several sporting goods online retailers, Amazon, and the Icebreaker website.I still have almost every Icebreaker item I\'ve bought.  Even the discounted items have been somewhat pricey, but the quality and longevity were worth the initial investment.In the last two weeks, I have tried to replace a few of my key Icebreaker items but found the fit and cut of the current versions of the same items to be sub-par.  I will keep using my old items for another year, and hope that next year\'s fit and cut will be better-suited to my','I012041121'),(1150,'2013-12-10',5,'perfect little flats','[[\'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry\', \'Women\', \'Shoes\', \'Flats\']]','Love these flats!

This, of course is the end of my sleep for this night.  I\'ve tried taking every nutrient known to mankind, and nothing helped.So, I decided to try these soft leg warmers.  I already knew I would like the fabric because I have socks and scarves made of it. It feels so luxurious.  The thing I wasn\'t sure of was whether I could actually sleep in them because my skin is so sensitive, and I thought after a while they might itch, but I\'ve had them for about 3 weeks, and I\'ve slept peacefully throughout (most) nights. My sleep has improved about 90%. They\'re long enough that when nights are cold, I can slip them right down to cover my feet as well, so I\'m warm all the way from my knees to my toes.I think maybe they should come in sizes.  I considered getting some for my mom who also deals with night cramps, but I don\'t think they would fit her legs because they\'re quite a bit larger than mine. I\'m 5\'2\" and weight 129 lbs, and these fit perfectly.  In another review, someone said hers immediately got a hole in them. They come with a tag attached with a plastic strip run through the fabric.  Clip that strip carefully; if you jerk it out of the fabric, you\'re almost assured to get a hole in the area where it was pulled through.

The extender might be handy for those with thicker wrists but I have mine closed on the tightest link anyway.It is fairly heavy on the wrist so if you dislike heavy bracelets you might want to steer clear of it. There is some jingle to it since the beads are free moving and they do tend to slip under your wrist when typing so that might be a consideration for a work day.The biggest con I can think of for this item is that the chain the beads are on is a spring design and easily catches and pulls the fine hairs at the wrist.

These shorts include the Pearl Izumi Men\'s Liner Short which can be purchased separately.  The shorts are reasonably priced when you consider the cost of the liners.The material is light but stays in place as you ride.  The amount of material is not skintight nor saggy & rarely gets caught on my saddle.  The single zippered pocket is ample enough to hold a medium wallet (located on the lower portion of the right leg)  Edit:  The single, limited pocket is the worst of these shorts.  More pockets in other locations would have been very desirable.  Limit what you carry or store stuff elsewhere with these.The elastic waistband adjusts with several buttons on each side of the shorts.  A pair of loops inside the waistband clip to the short liners (to avoid sagging?) I purchased a medium size for an approx. 35\" waist and only a minor adjustment to the waistband was needed.  Edit:  Check the other reviews for sizing advice.  Some say the shorts run a bit large.The padded liner portion of the shorts are definitely the highlight of the product and I suggest you check out those independent reviews (search Pearl Izumi Men\'s Liner Short).  The existing user reviews on the liners are very clear and constructive.  I will be purchasing more of the liners in the near future - they work well with other shorts.','I144804904'),(1269,'2012-10-30',5,'So adorable!','[[\'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry\', \'L\', \'Leg Avenue\'], [\'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry\', \'Women\', \'Petite\'], [\'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry\', \'Novelty, Costumes & More\']]','This product was perfect!

The information and request to come to Scotland came from Douglas MacGregor, owner of the pub Mac\'s.  The danger is increased when a local man is killed.  With all the threats Allegra has to face it\'s a good thing she has a guardian angel.  Casper, not his real name, was a warrior in a Germanic tribe that fought the Romans.  He died 1st or 2nd century AD.  In order to get into heaven he has to be a guardian angel AND abstain from sex.  This is his penance for the raping and pillaging he indulged in during his lifetime.  This translates into some serious sexual tension between Casper and Allegra.ALLEGRA FAIRWEATHER: PARANORMAL INVESTIGATOR is different and fun.  The story has excellent flow and reads very quickly.  I like Allegra\'s voice and sense of humor.  The mystery is good and trying to figure out what was coming next kept me on my toes.  One of the entities was kinda scary & not one I was really familiar with.  The relationship with Casper is very appealing.  I really appreciate the fact that they both put his entrance into heaven above their temporary carnal satisfaction.  It creates a tension and dynamic that has, in my opinion, an old fashioned romantic feel.  It would suit me if they never scratch that itch.

No, it\'s not as angsty or perhaps as deep as Ms. Lane\'s other books (I am a huge fan!), but I just adore the way she writes - it\'s such a refreshing, funny, biting style, and Sebastian seemed such a perfect fit for her \"voice.\"MILD SPOILERS:Sebastian is out, and with a vengeance, sporting rainbow t-shirts and entirely unapologetic about his sexual preferences. He lives in a world of perpetual academia, plans on starting work on his second PhD with his best friend Bella. But we learn that much about Sebastian, and Bella for that matter, is a cover for the pain in their lives they are both trying to escape. Sebastian\'s pain, without spoiling much, is a result of a less than loving family. Bella\'s is something different, because she is blessed with the \"perfect\" family - including a brother named Asa - the brother who \"bewitches\" Sebastian.Asa is reeling from a painful divorce, and has sole custody of his (adorable) 7 year old son, Jordan. In spite of his pain, however, Asa is ready to love again when he meets Sebastian (in a funny scene where a buck-naked Asa threatens Sebastian with a baseball bat, thinking he\'s a burgler!). He\'s had a single encounter with another man, and is open-minded and most definitely turned-on by the gorgeous Sebastian. One thing leads to another, but it\'s not the formerly straight Asa who runs away in fear...it\'s Sebastian. The main focus of the story is on Sebastian and Bella\'s growth, as we watch them work through their fears and \"grow up.\"I agree with some of the other reviewers that the tension in the story was pretty predictable, but honestly didn\'t care. I didn\'t need a major trauma or angst to round out the plot. I also agree that Asa\'s character is a bit too good to be true, but I think part of this comes from the fact that, although the narrative is in the third-person, the story is most definitely told from Sebastian\'s persepctive, and Sebastian worships the ground Asa walks on. Of course Asa would seem perfect.Ms. Lane did a marvelous job with the character of Bella, giving her depth and her own story. A nice change of pace from the traditional dual protagonist focus of M/M romance. I laughed out loud more than a few times (my kids kept giving me strange looks!) as I read some of the scenes. The sex scenes were hot and there were plenty to satisfy me.This would be a perfect beach read, if you\'re looking for something clever and sweet - a story to keep you smiling, well after you\'ve finished.

Something in her world changes and her parents realize they must let her choose her own path.

While the opening page and a half of the book is reasonable in terms of grabbing attention - setting up questions in the reader\'s mind, the following three pages of blatant exposition quickly cools whatever interest was roused for the plight of the two women stuck in the Nevada desert looking for the illegal horse round-up.The book would have benefitted much from an editor\'s eye being run over the text, followed by a good deal of hard thinking about what to keep in, and what to remove.  The dialogue feels forced and stilted, and in some places kept in merely for the sake of having dialogue, and the recurring instances of exposition - of telling, rather than showing - what is happening do not help to improve the overall impression of the story, of nor the authors skill at telling it.It is a shame, because it could have been such a good book if handled properly.','Not At All What I Hoped It Would Be'),(61,'2013-08-10 00:00:00','B004I6DB0I',5,'AYP2F74RZAT59','Linked by Hope WelshPaperback: 222 pagesPublisher: Rom On Line (February 13, 2012)18+ Adult readersI was given this book as a gift from a friend through amazon.Cover~ I love the cover.

She is the princesse\'s agemate and favored lady-in-waiting, and a Duchesse in her own right. She is both a friend and a counselor. Her life in constrained, but not bad, until everything goes to heck.She is caught up in a coup and forced to flee the palace carrying a magic talisman. She spends her whole time scared spitless and dealing with survivor\'s guilt, but as much as she has been trained to be frail and cossetted, she does manage to get herself going when she needs to.I can certainly see how some readers will be annoyed by her constant desire not to be who the fates are conspiring for her to be, but I think that for someone trained to be a lady, it is probably a pretty huge transition to become a leader. To move from keeping track of romances because they matter in the world of gossip to keeping track of alliances and the world of diplomacy is a pretty big scale change.I really appreciated how much Vianne gave up and had to grow up over the course of the book. She couldn\'t afford to be uncritical of anyone. The King, her princesse, everyone she met needed to be evaluated or re-evaluated in light of her new roles and duties. Does her Captain of Guards love her? Was the King bleeding the country? Are her new allies just using her? She can\'t afford to be trusting, although she does attempt to hang on to kindness as much as possible.She is not the sturdiest heroine. She has migraines. She spends much of the book dragged down by a fever. She cries a lot. I am pretty sure I would not cut a stoic figure if you dragged me two weeks by horse when I was suffering from the loss of all I had known. I am inclined to forgive her that, although it is an interesting authorial choice to make her so frail and yes, a bit whiny. I don\'t think it was an accident, so I want to think about what it means to be a heroine without being strapping.Possibly the best part of the book was the worldbuilding. Everything from the matrilineal descent to the two kinds of magic to the pantheon of gods was interesting and thought-through. I enjoyed the puzzle of figuring out who was what, and it was sometimes highly amusing, like the Pruzian Knives (ninjas!).I think the weakest part of the book was that sometimes you wanted to shake Vianne for not trusting herself. Once, she makes a decision against strenuous advice, and ends up saving herself, but then promises not to go against advice again. You were right, Vianne! Have some faith!I thought the captain of the guard and the bandit king were both compellingly interesting, each with his own flaws and strengths. Tristan (the captain) is pretty humorless, but he has his reasons.On the whole, I am looking forward to the sequel.Read if: you like palace intrigue. You enjoy watching people have greatness thrust upon them.Skip if: a whiny heroine is going to bother you.

Additionally, there were many sentences that read awkwardly and the author fell into the clich&eacute;d problem of telling instead of showing.

What stops them from going on a rampage, making front page headlines and causing mass panic throughout human society? In Chris Adonn\'s story, The Eyes that See, it is a highly evolved and secretive race called the Balancers. A race so secretive that to learn of them means death.The Eyes that See, released in March 2011, is a prelude to Chris Adonn\'s Balancer Series. Where the supernatural world is watched over by The Eyes that See, an ancient secret society in existence since the 5th century BC; it is their job to watch and document all supernatural beings. Adam Smith a fledgling research member of The Eyes that See, has discovered indisputable proof of a new undocumented supernatural race.  Fredrick Bradfield, head of the South African Division and Adam\'s benefactor has been searching for proof all his life that Balancers actually exists, a supernatural race that keeps the worse of the supernatural creatures from exposing paranormal beings to humankind.  Together, Adam and Fredrick enter a world where such knowledge is taboo; dark secrets are exposed threatening the ancient organization with ruin and meet the secret that is required to silence them.Being that the story was a prelude to a larger work of fiction, the book was a fast read; the story line was well written and guided you through the character interaction at a good clip, keeping you involved in the plot of the tale.  The lack of descriptive narrative on each of the characters physical forms left the characters half formed, leaving it up to the reader to decide how they looked; there was also a large lack of description of scenery and setting which detracted from the short tale giving it a feel of being unfinished and rushed.  Though  the character\'s personalities did come through the way they spoke making it easy to see their quirkiness.The premise of an \"immortal policing race\" was intriguing enough to keep me reading to the end to see how it all sorted out.  I found the ending a bit disappointing considering the ominous over tone of taboo and threat of death weaved through the story; how no one was allowed to be aware of the existence of the Balancers. The manner in which  the conflict was resolved at the end was quaint and extremely anti-climatic.  But considering that this was a prelude to a greater work and the storyline interests me I will crack the cover ofLegacy  - Book One of the Balancer Chronicles, in hopes that Chris Adonn has put a bit more time in character development and Scenery description.','Has promise ...good story line'),(97,'2013-08-04 00:00:00','B004W9BX7Y',4,'A8LVA20063AEN','A little naughty but still in good taste.

I will admit to being a little confused by the author\'s intent for his book. It started out as a very interesting, thoughtful thriller about a person being caught up in events over which he had no control. But somewhere along the line, it morphed into an almost comedic \"thriller\". Over the top characters were introduced and the quiet, unassuming lead character suddenly became a thrill-seeker of the first order, not only surviving but thriving in shootouts and explosions. That kind of lost me. I would have liked to see where the story and characters would have gone without the change in direction. Overall, it was just OK for me.

This book is the first in a series of three books about 3 English Lord friends who all find love. I think this book is an excellent read, it is very well written and kept me interested the entire time, making it hard to put down sometimes. It is not as &#8216;Steamy&#8217; as the other book I had read by this author, and the book that comes after this one in the series, &#8220;Broken&#8221;, is definitely hotter, so this book makes for a great Regency Romance.I loved the plot and story line, it was a great concept and she made it believable so it works. Jack, the Marquess of Ettington, is unsure of how to continue dealing with his twin sister, Virginia, Lady Orkney, four years after her husband, who was unusually cruel to her, has died. Virginia has lots of issues she needs to work through, so Jack invites their childhood friend, Constance Grange, aka Pixie, to stay with them in London. Virginia & Pixie are best friends but haven&#8217;t seen each other in years, and Jack was Pixie&#8217;s guardian after her father died, but she reached her majority and is no longer in charge of her as of a year ago. Pixie&#8217;s mother is still alive and has managed to spend all their money so they are broke. The story goes from there. There are a few friends in the book who add to the story and make great minor characters (some of which you can read their stories in the next two books). I also really enjoyed the secondary romance between the sister Virginia, as she heals throughout the book, and another long time friend.The only things I didn&#8217;t like about it was 1) the title, not really sure where it fits? And 2) there is a lot of sexual tension between Jack & Pixie and it takes forever for them to finally kiss, they should have kissed earlier on, they almost do, you think they will than, nothing. But otherwise a great read and I would highly recommend.','Great story line, creative, well written, great read'),(109,'2013-06-16 00:00:00','B004Z1UX70',5,'A1BCKYIEG9QLZD','Well PSI Agent Jasmine MacLellan is at it again in Book 2 of the Divine Cases and as I knew I would all I can say is we need more of the Team I have Read Cheryl Kaye Tardif other books The Children of the Fog Wonderful Read and Submerged and that one I could not but down Si I knew I had to get these two book and no I  am not sorry Cheryl gave another great story with plenty of turns and twists  I am on to the River next and hopefully we will see more Divine Book soon','Book 2 for the Divine Series will make you Want more of the Characters, so Book 3 please'),(110,'2014-03-08 00:00:00','B004ZCIG64',4,'A2BORTFYOKLIHX','This book was a fun and easy read from start to finish.

Kane and his demon partner, Chaz, work as troubleshooters for their demon boss, Shalim.  During an investigation into the death of a high school quarterback, Kane and Chaz discover that a consortium of Wizards seem to be more interested in young humans than they should be. The deeper Kane digs into the mystery, the more questions he turns up and more and more kids turn up in trouble. Kane partners with a demon from a different clan to try to solve the mystery and discovers that the consortium is after not demons, not humans, but a small group of beings that if they live past their 24th year are seemingly immortal.  Welcome to a world of witches, demons, wizards, immortals, humans and other beings that live in heaven, hell and earth.Kane was abandoned as a child and left to die when he stumbled into the demon world.  Shalim, the leader of the clan he stumbled upon, recognized there was more to Kane than just being a half-breed and allowed him to live among his clan.  Kane had to fight and claw for any respect he gained and prove to Shalim that he was an asset worth keeping.  Kane is loyal to his clan, more than a little jaded about the worthiness of others, but still manages to hold compassion and try to help others who might not be able to help themselves. Others see this trait in him and either take advantage of it, or think that it makes him weak. I think it is something he fights in himself and is not sure whether it\'s good or bad.  He is a little difficult to get to know but once you do you soon find he is just a big ole marshmallow under the swagger.  He tends to pick up strays and despite himself, gets attached to them.Along with Kane, we meet a mysterious female demon from another clan, Decible, who is hell-bent on helping Kane find the immortal kids and save them.  Kane is a bit wary of her intentions, but they work well as a team and Decible gives us bits and pieces of information about who she might be, but we really don\'t ever get to know her well.  She seems to know an awful lot about Kane and who he is, more than she should so I have a feeling we are going to see more of her in the future.  Another of Kane\'s ragtag band of misfits is Jezrielle, one of the teenage immortals. The consortium has Jezrielle in their sights. She reluctantly joins Kane and Decible in their quest.  Jezrielle is a strong, smart, street wise young lady who had to grow up too fast.  She goes from mistrusting Kane, but needing his help, to grudgingly trusting him and even possibly liking him. Rounding out the team is a nurse named Anne Kidd, who it turns out, is a witch who is just coming into her powers.  Anne isn\'t thrilled with learning she is a witch, she isn\'t thrilled with helping Kane and is even less thrilled with working with Decible, but Kane manages to pull her into their little group.  The interactions between Decible and Anne were particularly fun to watch and I have a feeling they are going to get more action in the future.While I enjoyed this book, it was a little difficult to follow at times, I kept feeling like I was beginning in the middle of the story and had missed some important background information.  Eventually, we get some of Kane\'s history and some world building as far as the demon realm goes, but I was still lost as to the politics involved between the Wizards, Demons and Witches. I\'m assuming we will get more information as the series goes on, but I think the book would have been better had we had it up front. It will be interesting to see where the author takes us in the future, I\'m sure there will be more to be heard from Kane\'s little group of misfits. There is a decent little reveal toward the end of the book, again it left more questions than answers but it was unexpected. I think if the author works out the kinks of world building and character building this will be a fun series to follow and I\'m looking forward to seeing what comes next.Reviewed as a Member of the Paranormal Romance Guild','A great first book in this series'),(115,'2013-11-03 00:00:00','B00513PJ20',4,'AWBVW5MA9L1D6','A short novella about Andrea and Raphael.

It\'s a nice and sweet and erotic contemporary Western with a dominating, rich ex-bullrider and a sweet, young naive Ango-Mexican woman.Travis was a champion bull-rider used to having a lot of females throwing themselves at him while he was on the circuit.  Now, as a rich ranch owner, females are few and far between for both him and his ranch hands.  Selena having escaped a horrible situation in Mexico, stumbles onto Travis\'s land after again escaping another bad situation and badly beaten.I did have trouble after this point believing that no one but Travis recognized the fact at first that she was a female.  I know it was stated several times that females were very rare in the area but still it was just not convincing enough to me.Travis immediately wants her, is drawn to her - because after all she is a young beautiful woman.  He also wants to keep up lock up so that none of his ranch hands find out she is a woman and start fighting over her.The action is basically Travis wanting Selena - getting angry because he knows that he shouldn\'t seduce a virgin, but can\'t keep from trying - getting jealous and taking it out on her and everyone - being nice one moment and downright ugly the next moment.That was why I could not see rating this book as a 4 or 5 - it reads more like a old Harlequin book which I\'m not that fond of.  It was okay especially for the price but I would not consider it a keeper nor on the same footing as a book in the series by Lorelei James, who is the author that actually got me hooked on \"HOT\" Contempory Westerns.If you are a reader that enjoys short novels with the \"Sweet Virgin and Dominant Male\" theme then you will enjoy this book.

The little girl is never allowed &#8216;outside&#8217; and she and Solomon spend hours together playing hide-and-seek, dancing, and expressing their deep, never-to-end love for each other.  Then, sadly, the cold-hearted step-mother makes a decision; the little girl has grown too old for such nonsense and the bear has to go.  What worse fate for a young child than to be threatened with the loss of something she loves so much.The distraught little girl runs away and Solomon is left alone.  His last glimpse of his dearest friend, his kindred soul, sees her running towards the forbidding forest.  When she doesn\'t return, his heart is broken and he begins to ask himself if their love was as real and as lasting, and as unforgettable as they had both said it would be.  Eventually, unable to bear (please forgive the pun) her loss any longer, Solomon seeks the advice of the other toys, toys he has never mixed with before, to find a way to leave the house and go in search of his beloved companion.Phillip Laird&#8217;s The Story of Solomon Bear is a beautifully, poetically written tale about the strength of an innocent, enduring love and a bond which cannot be broken.

To kill. She has no name, just a designation. Her kind, bitterns, are genetically engineered clones that serve the fae lords as their keenest hunters and assassins. They are little more than animals and are treated as such. She has always been different, however, resistant to conditioning, rebellious, obstinate, and unbreakable. No matter how brutal her masters\' torture, she defied restrictions. And she escaped.Since she crossed over to the world of round ears, to the human realm, she has pursued one goal with frightening intensity. Find the immortals who shared a common enemy with her and ally with them. Get the information she needs. Kill the psychotic vampire allied with the Dark fae king, then, when the walls between planes fall on Samhain, return to the fae realm and release her beserker rage all over the king and whomever else has the misfortune of getting in her way. She will slaughter them all. She knows this. She will not survive. She knows this too.With her first goal nearly in sight she is forced into a slight change of plans. The immortals she was tracking are battling rival vampires and fae beasts and to save them, she lets her berserker rage free. When she wakes up back at the building she\'d been squatting in since arriving in Dallas, she comes nose to furious nose with an exquisitely carved and obviously disgusted Native American face.That face belongs to Koda, ancient guardian, protector of his people, and friend of the immortals she was tracking. He loathes her, thinking her fae, as the fae have annihilated his race for centuries. Convincing him that she\'s not fae, that in fact she reviles them at least as much as he, is a herculean task. As it becomes clear that she\'s being targeted by her former fae masters, and the vampire she planned to execute suddenly ups the stakes on an impending war with humans and immortals alike, joining forces with Koda becomes the only viable strategic option.Two magical beings with a common goal, beginning as enemies, becoming wary allies. They must battle against the forces of evil before the death count spirals out of control and the land is scoured by the ravages of war. Along the way they will discover a fiery need for each other that neither had anticipated and it will forge allies into friends, then lovers. He is Koda. She is bittern...and she calls herself Sephti. Together they are the best hope for mortal and immortal alike.One hundred and ninety. That\'s the number of books I\'ve read, including this one, since January 1st. Nine. That\'s the number of those books, including this one, that I\'ve tagged as a favorite.

Those are the facts.Killing Timedeserved it. That\'s my opinion.I was a little bowled over by Paige\'sKilling Time. I wasn\'t expecting to be as impressed as I was, but despite not reading the first book in the series,Stealing Time(an oversight I can assure you I WILL be rectifying), just about every single one of my Happy Reader buttons got stroked, tickled, and pushed with delicious abandon.Fantastic characters - especially Sephti, who I was completely in love with before the first chapter was done. A layered and imaginative plot that struck the perfect balance between the urban fantasy elements and paranormal romance elements. A rich and vibrant world and mythos brimming with originality. A narrative that brought all those aspects together, reached out and grabbed me by the throat and carried me along for the duration. Man, Paige is a hell of a storyteller.The relationship between Sephti and Koda was so satisfying. Not only did they work well together as a couple, providing the romance lover in me with tons of heart-pounding moments of love, angst, and sexy sensuality, but Sephti was also a complete and three dimensional heroine in her own right, independent, deadly, and more than capable of not only pulling her own weight but rallying those around her to pull theirs too. I could easily imagine her as the center of her own urban fantasy series, and that satisfied the UF lover in me.The bad guys were heinous and truly threatening, their impact on the world and the characters tragic, so the plot started strong and main','One of My Favorite Reads This Year'),(140,'2014-07-10 00:00:00','B005D75Z8C',4,'A2UE20ZV1QWM9O','Good foundational piece for what\'s to come.

Unfortunately, the premise was the only good thing about this book, as the characters and situations were simply implausable.  Just before an important vote, a US IMF member is killed by faulty brakes on his brand new Lexus and despite the police being surprised, the incident is treated strictly as an accident! Even the new widow is unbelievably stoic about her husband\'s death and is more interested in planning the funeral than grieving or questioning. Coincidently, his brother happens to be a retired CIA operative and he alone is suspicious.  Even when a second member of the IMF narrowly escapes a terrorist-style bomb and the brother tries to impress the importance, do the US authorities seem somewhat interested.  Where\'s Homeland Security, the FBI, even the CIA?Without giving away the whole plot (although it wouldn\'t be a loss) the story moves to Russia, where the brother, his gutsy girlfriend and the original KGB agent team up to right all wrongs.  The few interesting looks into today\'s Russia are dwarfed by the repetitive, angst-ridden political intrigue.  If we heard a certain politician was ambitious and ruthless once, we heard it several times.  The chase scenes were yawn-worthy and I found myself paging through to find something of interest.

However, the tension here is more broad than merely learning who has done what to whom and how badly it hurt -- though there is some of that.  Instead, the larger value here is the controlled experiment performed by the author through his main character and narrator, Kip.Kip is searching through the afterlife for Lucy, both now memories to this world.  She is the love of his life and that is the whole of what matters to him.  Weller\'s experiment, then, poses this: \"Does who we love and how we love them, matter?  And will it matter after this life has concluded?\"The book is a rather knowing character study -- where the character is not really a particular individual but a relationship itself, spanning across decades of time and a multitude of distances throughout the mind and an after-life landscape as complicated and fraught with danger as is the land of the living.\"The world exists in all its infinite detail,\" Weller writes as Kip, \"which, going through the motions, we ignore on a daily basis.\" Each reader may come to their own interpretation of this novel.  For me it is a wrestle with the infinite detail not just within our world but within our relationships.  The tiny apartment of Kip and Lucy is just a microcosm in the vastness of literature, music, space and history, but become elevated by exploding it outward to examine in slowed motion. We are shown all the moving parts of their storied history together and, thus, understand Kip\'s very specific drive to keep it alive -- even after his own death.In THE LAND OF LATER ON Weller has built a complex world, replete with a heritage of literary greats and musical references that contribute to the realness of such an unreal place.  For me, a weight lifted after reading. I might not know what exactly happens following death but I know I\'m not alone in the eternal wonderings of it.

Ms. Frost&#8217;s books are always a must read for me. With MAGIC GRAVES I&#8217;ve been introduces to the writings of Ilona Andrews and I am counting myself the luckiest reader in the world to have discover her. Since both Ms. Frost and Ms. Andrews have novellas and excerpts from some of their other work I&#8217;m going to take them one at a time. Just a note here before I do. Both novellas included in MAGIC GRAVES are important to their respective series and should not be missed.I&#8217;m going to begin with Ms. Frost&#8217;s contribution to this book. Her novella is titled ONE FOR THE MONEY. A classic Cat and Bones story filled with wit, danger and nooky. What should have been a simple assignment turns into one of the closest calls Cat encounters in her many adventures of flirting with death. Take a spoiled-rich college girl that needs protection, add Cat&#8217;s mom Justina holed up in the same house as Bones and you have a recipe for disaster. Thing is, the danger comes from an entirely unexpected source. Fantastic read!As an added bonus to ONE FOR THE MONEY there are two excerpts included. The first three chapters to HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS, a Cat and Bones tale, will hook you and not turn lose until you get your hands on the story. The second excerpt comes from the first novel in the Night Prince Series call ONCE BURNED. This series is going to be about Vlad Tepesh, better known as Dracula. Just don&#8217;t call him that, he hates the title. From the little bit of the story that is shared I can already tell this will be another series by Ms. Frost I&#8217;ll simply have to read. No getting around it.Now on to Ms. Andrews. Thank you to whichever book god that lead me to the discovery of her stories. If you have already read any of her books you will know that I am truly grateful to be able to add her to my list of must read authors. If you&#8217;ve been reading her Kate Daniels series and not read A QUESTIONABLE CLIENT you really should correct that mistake. If you&#8217;ve not been reading the series this will give you a tiny bite into her world and the legion of strange creatures, both human and very non-human, that inhabit her post-apocalyptic Atlanta. Kate is a mercenary with extraordinary skills that takes a bodyguard assignment. To say the client, Saiman, is strange and dangerous would be a monstrous understatement.  I cannot read any of the Kate Daniels books and not crack a smile or chuckle out loud. Can&#8217;t be done. I&#8217;m obsessed with her books.Ms. Andrews has included an excerpt from book three in the Edge Series, FATE&#8217;S EDGE. And yes, this will be one more series I will be starting. The other sneak peek was a rough draft from a novella she was working on at the time. MAGIC GRIEVES will be one more story involving Kate. For a rough draft it was great and as intriguing as all the rest of the books in the series.

However, she is discovered by Bran The Fair, whom she happens to know since when she was a little child. Bran is the illegitimate son of the noble man who killed her parents and cast her out. Some years later Gwyneth was married to Geoffrey, the legitimate son of the nobleman, however, Gwyneth never allowed the marriage to be consummated by the murderers of her family, which finally led to the annulment of the marriage. Anyway, Bran is on his way to his father\'s deathbed where he is really stunned because his father orders him to take over Blackthorne and marry Gwyneth. Bran is more than satisfied because finally he has a wife, land and title. However, Gwyneth isn\'t that happy about the developments. Firstly, she doesn\'t want to be married to another son of her family\'s murderer and secondly, she strongly believes that Blackthorne should be returned to its legal heir - and these aren\'t the only problems Bran has to face, since the villagers seem to be loyal to some \"rebels\" who hide in the woods and stir things.Bran and Gwyneth were likeable and very realistic main characters. Bran was presented as a visionary and leader who respected his fellow knights and the villagers. Gwyneth on the other hand had to face her difficult past, a new unwanted marriage and was continuously under the pressure of a very serious secret that could endanger her future with Bran. Her constant struggle to choose between growing love to Bran and the loyalty to her family was nicely put without becoming too tedious.The story line was simple, clearly and well-arranged and offered even some unexpected twists and turns. However, the author tried with her \"epic\" way of writing to stress the time period during which the story played.

I\'d rather not give any plot twists away.Suffice to say, you\'ll enjoy the read.While many of the reviews on Amazon \"nit-pick\" every slight detail, and I can agree that when an author gets his facts and figures wrong on simple details, especially military hardware and weapons, it can interrupt the verisimilitude (willing suspension of disbelief) and ruin an otherwise good book.  This is especially an irritation to old soldiers such as myself.However, few authors today have the breadth of knowledge, or on Amazon, a team of editors to fact check this stuff, not that all editors catch it regardless.Conroy gets it right, more than not, and weaves a tale that is both interesting and fun to read, with just enough plausibilty to keep all but the most nit-picking skeptics and fault-finders at bay.Buy the book, get plenty of sleep before you start reading as once you start, you really want to just keep reading, and pretty soon, like me, you\'ll have bought everything this guys puts out.You\'ll be happy you did.','Follow this alternate-history author'),(177,'2013-06-29 00:00:00','B005SGXPB2',1,'AKCZAZFYKPQE7','I couldn\'t finish this short story.

After thinking about it, I realized that I just did not care about the main character,Landry James because she doesn\'t care about anything but self gratification and sex. She is basically an amoral, bored housewife who doesn\'t love her husband, only the things he gives her, and seems to spend her days caring only for her grooming and looking for new sex partners. Even when she and her friend are threatened at a sex club, she\'s excited by it, not worried that her friend had a knife to the throat. In the end, she is recruited to be a sort of Mata Hari. She\'ll get paid by the government to have sex with men and get pillow talk information from them because she\'d be doing it anyway, so she might as well do it for her country (and money).

I have been waiting and waiting and wondering when an enterprising author would hit upon the idea and I have finally found it.  Zoe is all the best of Percy--funny, spunky and prone to a lot of trouble which made for one great read.After wandering into a forbidden temple while on a trip with her archaeologist uncle and aunt, Zoe is transported to ancient Greece.  Really ancient Greece-1000 BC or so.  To find her way back, she must travel to the oracle (isn\'t there always an oracle) and follow said directions.  Of course, along the way, she must endure trials on Mt. Olympus, rescue various creatures from destruction and get in a catfight with a teenaged Hera.Did I mention she also meets and falls in love with a cute teenage boy who saves her on more than once occasion.  Maybe because he\'s Zeus and, like, the god of everything.  His friends and girlfriend Hera are not happy with the arrangement and throw even  more deadly obstacles in the path of the star-crossed lovers.There is so much to like about this book.  Right away, from the very first paragraph, I felt like I knew Zoe and she was talking straight to me.  That kind of connection isn\'t often found in books and I relished it, reading way past the time I usually give to myself and burning a few dinners in the process.  It has a great message in it for young girls and isn\'t just mindless drivel like many of the girly books out there.  This is one heroine a young girl could really sink her teeth into and learn a valuable message about to boot; namely, that, the trials and obstacles in life often teach us about what we are made up of and teach us what we want in life and what is really  important.  The perfect combination of romance and adventure.The book is a first in a trilogy so be prepared to keep reading--the first one ends in a cliffhanger that wasn\'t satisfying at all.

This is no small feat as our main character Zyre (she is an elf) travels to different worlds in her attempt to flee from a pending arranged marriage.I liked (a lot) that the author gives a bit of a background regarding characters and situations.  This starts from the beginning when pixies are being plied with gin in taverns.  Then she mentions that elves are masters at being able to hide in plain site.  Details such as these gave depth to the story and helped me understand various situations as they unfolded.  Moving throughout the magical realm was seamless due to the placement of the details.I liked the mix of fantasy, romance, action and suspense that flowed through the book as Zyre travels from her own world to the world of humans.  The addition of vampires adds a nice twist and the story continues to flow well with the addition of other characters such as the cat Zyre encounters once we are to the part about the vampire house.I liked this book for many reasons.

A lawyer with a penchant for the underdog, and a niche practice where he defends and provides legal advice for the arrested and persecuted beings.Incredibly well written, with a nice nod to To Kill A Mockingbird, we see the overt separation and distrust and even irrational dislike of the arcanes, perhaps simply because they are different and the years of legends and exaggerated stories have created that ingrained fear.  And of course, there is election-time politics and grandstanding to deal with as well.What strikes me most about the story is the innate believable premise, that window into the current and real world through a highly stylized fictional genre.  The process, just lightly detailed, that highlights the \'say anything to be elected\' that plays on the fears of the electorate with little to no fact and the people who eat it up. Sadly, not a situation confined to the fictional world.What was best about this book? That it was both well written and easy to read without being \'dumbed down\' for it\'s readers.  Not everything is laid out to decide how you should think about any of the situations, but allows you to make decisions and choices.  Certainly much of this is the genre, as a fan of paranormal fiction we are already inclined to have our own thoughts about the supernaturals ( although Arcane is the politically correct phrasing )and perhaps that grants a certain sympathy toward the introduction of the topics, which John Abramowicz does with a nice flair.

Lodge delves into Chinese American cultural relations in 1906 San Francisco. She immerses the reader into the vast differences in the lives of the white population and the Chinese population through the lives of Ruth Greer and Li Hanlin while demonstrating how people themselves tend to be very similar regardless of culture. When Ruth meets Hanlin, she feels an immediate attraction that leads her to look for reasons to return to the Li household. She becomes an English tutor for the Li family much to her father\'s dismay and confusion. Ruth\'s father works hard to separate her from Hanlin as Hanlin fights his attraction to Ruth. Lodge\'s exploration of the culture of Chinatown is at once interesting, engaging, and discomforting. Lodge pulls the reader into a world filled with drugs, sex, and violence seen from multiple angles. Her writing depicts the world in which the characters live without being gratuitously graphic. The characters populating the pages of Gold Mountain are as diverse as the people who populated San Francisco in 1906. Tragedy, bigotry, misconceptions, betrayal, loyalty, and love, both romantic and familial, travel through the pages of Gold Mountain taking the reader on a journey of survival, triumph, loss, and renewal that rings as relevant today as it did during the 1906 time period in which it was set.

For an intro story, this was really disappointing. There were a couple frightening moments, but the style of a story being told to them drained the impact of the frightening parts. Also, the ending seemed more like a twist for the sake of having a twist than leaving me in a terrified state - which is what I\'m used to from One Buck Horror. I\'ll give it 3 stars.The second story, \"Theridia,\" by Mark Onspaugh, is about an older brother going to find out why his younger brother didn\'t go stake their claim at a silver mine like he said, but instead is staying in the town of Rusty Saw. He goes to find out why, and soon determines he needs to stay as well. Will he let his brother have what now draws them both to stay? This was a good story, 4 stars. Despite a first line I thought could have been cleared up a little, I\'m glad I read on.Looks like an upward trend for the first three stories as the third is a 5 star tale. \"Walter\'s Friends,\" by Nick A. Zaino III is a well rounded story with the right ending. To save from spoilers, I\'ll just say I was impressed with the writing, the world-building, the twist on the genre, and the character arc from beginning to end. I\'ll keep my eye on Nick for future stories.The fourth story, \"Bayani\'s Promise,\" by M.R. Jordan, keeps the momentum with another 5 star tale. I particularly liked this one because it reminded me of my honeymoon in Cozumel, and how I sensed a whole other world beyond the tourist areas. This story captures what life would be like beyond the tourist centers when life is about pure survival. What awaits both in the dark and at home are some pretty horrifying revelations. This was well written and had enough twists and turns to keep me engaged and leave me satisfied.The last story, \"In the Eye of the Beholder,\" by Kristine Ong Muslim, is a 4 star with an interesting twist that left me disturbed. Classic One Buck Horror. It\'s not a 5 star because some of the details didn\'t line up in my mind.

When one of them kills an employee at their pharmaceutical company right in front of her she thinks they are vampires, but the police don&#8217;t believe her and her brother has her committed to a mental institution for evaluation. When she manages to escape and put up a blog about the vampire she witnessed killing a woman this brings her to the attention of the actual vampires, the Dark Protectors. It&#8217;s time for damage control, so the vampire King of the Realm, Dage Kayrs, sends his best hunter, Max Petrovsky, to find Sarah and take care of the problem.Max is the biggest, baddest, fiercest hunter Dage has and most would say his heart is made of stone, but he doesn&#8217;t stand a chance against the four-year-old he needs to guard. Max discovers he actually has a heart when he has to spend a good amount of time guarding Janie, so it&#8217;s not such a huge surprise when he meets Sarah that there is room for her there, too. Max is an awesome alpha hero with kick ass fighting skills and a great match for Sarah who couldn&#8217;t really fight her way out of a wet paper bag though she is stubborn and full to the brim with perseverance. The chemistry between the two is steamy, the plot is good, the characters wonderful and there is humor sprinkled throughout.

The bodies she assumes are those of individuals who are in some kind of difficulty. Apparently, she is quite good at adjusting to the problem and finding a solution and this is the reason for her continued wandering among the mortals.In her ministerial duties she is aided by Will, an ethereal `mentor\' who provides a certain amount of basic material to aid in her endeavors. In this particular episode, Abby finds herself in a man\'s body necessitating some adjustments and the need to learn new simple manly routines.As in the first of the series, the story moves along at a nice pace with a simple but credible plot and acceptable characters. Young male readers may notice that the directions for tying a tie apply only if one is left handed and that one does not usually shave after putting on a tie.

But when a car accident leaves him paralyzed, he falls into a dark depression and loses all hope of sharing a life together. When Lilly is hired as his physical therapist, he is ashamed to have her see him so weak and helpless, and employs every trick in the book to drive her away.Regardless of Simon\'s fierce temper and sharp tongue, Lilly refuses to let him bully her into leaving. Not just because she believes she can help Simon walk again, but because she is hopelessly in love with himMy ThoughtsAlthough this book was downloaded on my Kindle as a free read, I was looking forward to reading it because of the story description.At the beginning of the story, you realize that Lilly has met Simon before his accident, but never had the opportunity to speak with him. She did feel an instant connection with him, but was shy and afraid that he would not be interested in her, because he was handsome and could have any woman that he wanted.She still feels an attraction, and hopes that she can keep a professional attitude.Although Simon, who is unable to see at the time Lilly arrives at his home as his physical therapist, he recognizes her as the woman that he met at the club, that he felt himself being drawn too, but was unable to speak with her because she ran out.He also still feels an attraction, but feels less of a man, and wants to get rid of her.This book was well written, however, I felt like the relationship with Lilly and Simon was still a bit rushed.  They went from avoidance of one another to in bed with another before the week was over.  I would have liked to see them take a little longer to come to terms with their feelings for one another.There is also a secondary relationship in this book, and I would have liked to read more on their back story and future.

You could say that this book puts on display the seedy underbelly of the times in a way that Georgette Heyer never would.With themes involving laudanum addiction and child abuse, there\'s no doubt that this book touches on problems never mentioned in lighter historical fare. But at the same time the story is not all doom and gloom; not by a long shot. The sad and unhappy aspects of the plot are more than counterbalanced by the unfolding relationship between Michael and Wes. Here we have two very damaged individuals who find in each other a reason to go on. They bring out the best in each other, and their growing attraction, turning to love, gives them strength and enables them to fight their personal demons and become better people because of it. And isn\'t this an uplifting example of what the best romantic relationships may offer?There is some unpleasant content here, but the positive aspects of the tale were quite uplifting and rest assured that things end well for the pair. However, I did have a few questions at the end; now let\'s see, what can I say without giving away any key plot points....Michael and Wes end up in an ideal situation, but one that perhaps isn\'t perpetually sustainable given the constraints of the time period. I\'d like to see how, as time passed by, they managed to continue to live as a couple while still fitting into society. It\'s true enough that there was a great deal of hypocrisy among the aristocracy in 19th century England. Wait, that\'s true of every society in every time period! But what I\'m saying is that the upper class could get by with behavior that might flout the conventional societal moral norms of the time, as long as the individuals were discreet and didn\'t focus undue attention upon themselves. It really was possible for two men to have a serious committed romantic relationship in this society (even 200 years ago). But to do so they would have to have a logical and innocuous reason to spend a lot of time in each other\'s company, or live in the same house. And I wanted to know how the two protagonists pulled this off after the story concluded.Also, I have to wonder about the fate of the Westin family after the shattering events that engulfed them. (I should note this scandal was NOT due to anything that Wes did!) Could the family, no matter how well-connected and powerful, continue to take their place, and have an influence, in polite society? Or would they have to start afresh in some other country, perhaps on the continent or even America? I simply don\'t know how this would have played out in Regency England.But my questions didn\'t adversely affect my feelings about the story. This is a book that I grew to like even more after I had read it, and thought about it a bit. I suppose I was rather uncomfortable with a few of the plot twists as I was in the process of reading, and only upon reflection did my feelings shift a little. I\'ll recommend this one to those who enjoy Regencies with gay characters.

I thought growing up with 5 brothers was bad enough.  Poor Jessica!This novella is an introduction to the new Jessica McClain series by Amanda Carlson.  It nicely sets the stage for the full-length novel coming out in Fall 2012.  Overall, the novella gives us a good description of the main character, Jessica, and an understanding of how her upbringing and struggles made her who she is now.The author has given life to a fierce and uncompromising society of werewolves where Jessica McClain was not supposed to exist.  In this world, there are no females born of werewolf fathers. Until Jessica.  Most in the Pack feared her and some even thought she was the prophesied one spoken of in the `Cain Myth\' (the true Daughter of Evil would eventually destroy the entire werewolf race). That fear was smoldering to a point where Jessica\'s life is at risk.At the very beginning of the novella, we are thrust into the violent world in which Jessica lives.  With Jessica constantly fighting for her life, the tone is somewhat dark. However, the author convincingly offsets the tension with Jessica\'s keen sense of humor.The pace rises and falls nicely where it\'s supposed to and it flows effortlessly from scene to scene.I admit I am a big fan of novellas. It\'s incredibly difficult to create a good backstory, develop characters and establish an interesting plot in such a limited amount of pages.  A lot of authors will end up overwhelming readers with too much detail or underwhelming them with too few.  It\'s hard to get the balance just right.  I think it\'s a true test of an author\'s skill to communicate all we need to know and successfully deliver a well-structured story.  Amanda Carlson is one of those skilled authors.What I particularly liked about this novella (and this series) is the author\'s ability to interlace a new take on werewolf culture with a strong social message about self-preservation and how far a person is willing to go to survive.If you enjoy urban fantasy series like Sabina Kane by Jaye Wells or Chicagoland Vampires by Chloe Neill, then I think you\'ll like this series.  The heroines of these series are similar in that their will to survive is what motivates them to do whatever it takes to overcome major conflicts/obstacles thrown in their way.________________________________________Just a bit more about the story...Considered an abomination and a genetic freak of nature, Jessica has had to fight pretty much every day of her life.  Even though she is the daughter of the Pack leader, even he couldn\'t protect her all of the time.  While the wolves listened and respected their leader, if fear and emotions got the better of them, they would most likely kill her regardless of the possibility of losing their lives.With the threats becoming more frequent and escalating in aggression, Jessica finally decides to take matters into her own hands.  She challenges a member of the Pack, albeit one she thinks she has a chance to beat, to a fight.  Mitch was only too happy to oblige.  Plan A for her was to beat him senseless and then the others would back off.  At least to give her some breathing room.Relying on her sparring skills learned from her brother, her wits and her knowledge of werewolf weaknesses, Jessica thinks she can win.  If her plan fails and the threats continue, she has a Plan B.  To leave home and go away to start a new life where no one would know her.  Her father is strongly opposed to letting her go, fearing she would be killed without his protection.  What he doesn\'t realize is that she is in just as much danger, if not more, by staying.________________________________________The Characterization...Jessica is a character that immediately brought out my protective side.  Yes, she\'s absolutely fearless and tough and can handle herself, but she is basically scratching to stay alive by staying at the Compound.  I hated seeing her get hurt and I wanted to jump right into that novel and help her in that fight.  She would only end up protecting me and saving my butt, but that\'s beside the point... The author still brilliantly made me feel that way.Even though this first novella is all about Jessica and developing her character, we were introduced to a few others who will probably play a part in novels to come.

There is a turf war starting and Jaime\'s bloodline is sought after, as the time gets nearer to her first `wolf moon\' (coming of age) Jaime senses that Sirus isn\'t the only wolf on her trail.  Danger is all around her and Jaime knows now it\'s more important than ever that she gets her revenge and kills him before he does as he threatened and takes her as his `lifemate\' to ensure his Alpha status over her old territory.I loved the fact that Jaime wasn\'t at any point a push over, she didn\'t swoon at Sirus\' feet in an unnatural sudden turn from hate to love and just because `he\' wanted her it didn\'t change the fact that; as her wolf instincts dictated, she would only end up mating with the strongest Alpha, the one who proved himself, the one who managed to catch her....even if that ended up being one of the others in the chase.This is the second book in the Wolves of Black River series. Both books have ended and we haven\'t been left with a cliff hanger in either, although characters from `Mark of the wolf\' are in this book, they are both separate stories. This is the type of series I enjoy (I hate cliff hangers with a passion!)Blood of the wolf is fast paced and full of action with plenty of passion and lust. The lack of romance between our two main characters gave a realistic feel to their relationship and it was an interesting change to the norm for a `love\' story.T.L Shreffler definitely has a writing style that I love to read and the ability to draw me into her world with an ease that I don\'t find often. Her descriptions of fight scenes had me holding my breath with tension and able to visualise every bite and every drop of blood spilt. She managed to find the balance that so many other writers don\'t achieve in their work, scenes were neither over written nor understated and I enjoyed every page.

Not that great but not bad either.  I finished the book, and mostly enjoyed it while I read it.  But really, when I was done, I had to admit I wouldn\'t miss the story or characters one bit.Now there were some good points.  For example, the author creates a civilization in which the tribe is the basic organizing social structure.  Not only are tribes the basis around which towns/cities are built, but they also dramatically affect the cultural norms by which the members live.  We see tribes that are matriarchal, tribes that are essentially hunter-gatherers, tribes that are religious based, etc., etc.  Overall, I found this to be an interesting feature; albeit unrealistic that all these tribes would live in very close proximity for a thousand years and have virtually no knowledge/understanding of each other.The story itself is fairly interesting:  it tells the story of the good guy main character, who of course is unknowingly more than he seems, as he rises to greatness leading the good tribes against all that is evil.  Along the way there is the obligatory meeting of his soul mate and resulting insta-love.  This romantic element, however, wasn\'t the focus of the book and didn\'t overwhelm the story.My main criticisms were:1) I thought the characters were two dimensional at best.  The main character is helped in his journey to greatness by 3 secondary characters.  None of these secondary characters were fully developed, in my opinion.  Now one character is meant to be somewhat mysterious, I get that.  Nevertheless, since this particular character is instrumental in the development of the main character, I really would have expected more insight into his background and motivations.  The main character\'s love interest as well didn\'t get fully fleshed out.  She, in particular, had an interesting experience during the book that could have been more fully told.2) My second problem had to do with the muddled theology in the book.  There are apparently evil spirits and what appear to be fallen angel-like creatures, there are apparently good-guy angel-like creatures, there appears to be a good god, and there appears to be a satan-like creature.  Now I used the word \"appears\" in all of those previous phrases because none of this is very well explained.  Since this \"war\" between the good god/angels and bad god/angels is the main impetus of the story, the muddled presentation of all of this was very unsatisfying.  In the end, for me, it dramatically increased my level of impatience with the story.3) I thought the combat descriptions were either confusingly written or the author doesn\'t really have a good feel for what this sort of medieval-level of war fighting would be like.  It got a little tiring reading about every other character wielding their sword/axe in circles and mowing down dozens of opponents at a time.  Yet that\'s the kind of battle description we repeatedly received.  No mention of a shield wall, formations, tactics, etc.  And I won\'t even bring up the author\'s idea of good tactics being that a city garrison, outnumbered 2 or 3 to one, particularly in cavalry, would choose to confront this overwhelmingly superior force outside the city walls on the open battlefield (OK, I lied and brought it up anyway).4) Lastly, I got tired of the main character being \"too good\".  He has no flaws.  He\'s good looking.  He is always good natured.  He is super intelligent.  He is always diplomatic.  He is the bravest one around.  His prowess in combat is unequalled.  Although he\'s just a farm boy, he gets the noble girl.  Add to all of that the magical blessings that make his armor impenetrable and the magic from his sword unstoppable and the main character, for me, became just another boring Mary Sue.Now even with all of those shortcomings I found in the book, the book was mostly entertaining.  I\'m not sorry I bought it.

Probably I was expecting hot sex behind the scenes and the usual media scandals, maybe even the classical Hollywood scene of the red carpet where finally the actor admits his love for a man... and instead I found a couple in the aftermath of something huge, the stalker is already dead, the two heroes started a not simple relationship, and apparently Sean, the actor, is becoming crazy, if he wasn\'t yet crazy even before.In the previous book we discovered that Sean is not imagining things and that there is another stalker in his life, someone he would never suspect. Dan again becomes his hero, but at the same time he is his worst enemy: Dan is not accepting that Sean is playing the role of the perfect balanced man. Sean has problems, bigger ones, he is in denial; he faces them in his own way, forcing himself to accept things that his mind is trying to refusing, like sex with a man, and running away when faced with the true.The second book starts with Sean who is another time in danger, but this time he is far from Dan... he ran away, as usual, with the excuse to filming a movie in Galles. Even if before leaving he played the role of the lover who couldn\'t understand why Dan wasn\'t accepting, it\'s quite obvious that it was the perfect chance for Sean to not face again the truth; it was unthinkable for Dan to leave his work for more than three months, and Sean made everything possible to put Dan in front of an accomplished fact. Now in Galles Sean was victim of an accident, or maybe of an attempt murder, and he lost his recent memory; the only thing he remembers is that he loves Dan and he wants him near him, and Dan arrives, without questions or delaying.Sean is again all sweetness and words of undying love, but Dan this time doesn\'t buy it all; I like this double face of Dan, strong an unyielding in front of Sean, wanting from him to admit his mistakes and take measures for them, but at the same time protective and gentle, never leaving him alone. One of the fault I probably found in the previous book was that Sean and Dan\'s outside images were sometime stronger than their private side: this was maybe the reason why I felt the need to read something more on how they met and fell in love, and the reason for why they decided to live together. The second book fills completely that void, giving to Sean and Dan\'s feelings and reasons a main role, and letting the mystery in the background, almost nonexistent.During Sean\'s recovery, he replays in his mind two different timeline of his life with Dan: their first moment together, before the events that took place in book 1, and the aftermath of that book, when they tested their living together and Sean\'s inability to admit that he needed help. Don\'t get me wrong, it seems quite like Dan is the perfect knight in shining armor and Sean a shrinking violet who needs a shrink (pun intended); it\'s not exactly like that, Sean has only had very bad and negative experience with the doctor professional category and he needs time to trust them again. Dan on the other side is the perfect partner, supportive and attentive, with the right dose of protectiveness; maybe he should have more faith in Sean, and doesn\'t worry too much if the man goes 3 months away for work. But also Dan has to have some faults, a too perfect hero would be too much boring, so he is instead a knight in shining, and a bit cracked, armor, that is even better.Again the book is not what I was expecting (no big Hollywood scenes) but nevertheless a book that got me hooked till the end. And this time for me it\'s complete, not loose ends, the love story is full, developed and nicely tightened up.','The White Knight by Josh Lanyon'),(294,'2013-02-09 00:00:00','B007IJLGUY',5,'A3L99QA1E6JWQ4','The book has a lot of information and ideas in it.

Well written and factual, the book weaves history with fantasy and magic into a story that I could not put down.

I felt David\'s character was very realistic, and even though it was quite short, we were able to see him mature from the beginning to the end of the story.I would have loved to have a bit more of an ending.

Like many teens, she is trying to find her place in her society, while skirting the rules.  Her story is paralleled by that of a human girl Grace, who has a scheme to run away to go to art school to escape the family drama of her grandmother\'s drinking and her own guilt about her grandfather\'s death.  While the fairies must keep their existence secret from humans, Grace\'s grandmother knows about them, but of course, no one believes her. When the time comes that Swoop needs her help to save a friend\'s life, Grace needs to capture a fairy to prove that her grandmother is not crazy.I was impressed by the realism of the fairy society, which treats fairies as small people who can fly with the use of a special ointment, which is now running out, and that no one knows how to make. Clearly, fairies have not always lived in the mall, and the book hints at their previous history, raising questions to be explored in series.The human situation is well described too, though in broader strokes, as we already know what it\'s like to be human.  Like many first-in-the-series novels, this one lets us fly through the fairy world, following as Swoop takes ever-increasing risks. Both girls make unfortunate choices, and the repercussions  make their original goals seem childish.

The villagers demanded a sacrifice. No matter how much he tried to teach them of The Great Mother\'s love, they would not give up their barbaric practices. When he reached the temple, he thought vandals had desecrated it, only to find it was worse than that - a sacrifice, it was his granddaughter. The Mother anointed him with his granddaughters ashes and told him it was time and proceeded to destroy the temple.When he awoke, it was to find the villagers gone, only blood left behind. It was a new day, a prophet was born he thought as he walked away from the village.Tommy\'s girlfriend had dumped him and hooked up with Eric, a ghoul with ragged hair, greasy skin and clothes that looked like they were from Goodwill. Tommy and Eric had a couple of run-ins, but Tommy told him he really didn\'t want Alyson back so he didn\'t need to be jealous. Eric wouldn\'t let it go.Tommy and his friends went to the movies and when they came out, Eric and some skin head friends of his were waiting for them. As Bruce and Tommy managed to overpower the skinheads, Eric just stood and watched. When he heard the police sirens coming, he took off.Tommy had taken the brunt of the fight. He had grabbed the knife being held on Coda with his bare hand. As the doctor was stitching it up, Coda had come in asked why he would do something like that for someone he didn\'t even know. His response had been, there wasn\'t anything else he could do. Tommy told Coda about his grandfather, a Taoist monk, who taught him martial arts and how he taught Bruce and some others and she was more than welcome to join them.Alyson came to Tommy after Eric had given her a box to keep for him. She had opened it and what she had seen inside frightened her. She told them about Eric\'s dark side and how he was into magic. She thought the book was a grimoire and it gave her the creeps. Tommy thought they should go see an old friend of theirs, Mike Ferguson, who might be able to help them figure out what the book was all about. They warned him not to let Eric find out he had it.When Tommy and Alyson went back to Mike to see what he found out, Mike had a crazy look on his face. Mike was asking Alyson if Eric had any odd cuts or wounds, when they heard pounding at the doors. They exploded inward. The group was around the table which was surrounded by a blue line, a ward of protection. Eric appeared looking like a monster, with shapes carved all over his face,  even his teeth. He broke through the barrier and grabbed Mike demanding the book. When Eric grabbed Tommy, it was all he could do to remain conscious until something hit Eric and dropped him to the floor. Bruce stood there with a piece of railing in his hand. Alyson threw the book to Eric. As Eric said to tell them he was coming, he slit his own throat.Mike, along with his goth girls were at Eric\'s grave. When Tommy saw Mike, he told him to  enjoy what time he had left. What did he mean by that? The book Eric had was the worst, it dealt with calling the Nephilim. The prophecies had said Eric would return as the Prince of Nephilim. One of the rituals involved eating a fetus cut from the womb.As Mike began telling them about his delve into magic, he had to show them examples and do a lot of explaining. Will Eric return as the Prince of Nephilim? What will he do it he does return? Would he destroy them or the whole world?As the Peris, Mike\'s goth girls, told the history of the First of the Host and the Great Creation, it made me think of the Charmed Ones, a TV program currently in re-runs.

Bruce was more of a goof off and Tommy was more serious, mystical even. Tommy was such a good guy. He knew he could take violence to a new level, but he tried really hard to control it. Bruce could go from a foul-mouthed, trash talking screw up to a sweet big-hearted teddy bear with Kung-fu.

Even when she finds herself drawn back in to relationships and feelings that move her away from a place of safety, she remembers the God who has sealed her to himself.These poems take the reader through betrayal, sorrow and a marvelous comfort as she is pulled from and through what most troubles the soul.

Fierce guards and huge wolves are assigned the sole duty to protect her as they travel.  They meet renegades who demand a toll.  The guards are planning to pay the renegades, but Daeton jumps off her horse & runs up to the renegades, ignoring her guards, yelling that they won\'t pay them & they\'d better let them pass \"or else\".  She instructs the guards & wolves to rally around her & the renegades run off.  So, Daeton ignored the guards, (who were trained to know how to handle dangerous situations) and does whatever she feels like doing, which puts everyone\'s life in danger.  Instead of the guards and everyone being angry, they all compliment her on how brave she is.  Surely, there is no braver female in the realm.The story was riddled with similar immature actions that we were supposed to admire.  I had trouble reconciling the author\'s audience.  I understand that the heroine was 18, so maybe it is targeted at a teenage audience, but the writing style seemed more geared toward 13 & 16 year olds.The sex scenes were more of the same writing style.  They lacked depth and interest.To be fair, it was only 99 cents. Just don\'t expect more than your money\'s worth.

We first meet her as she is taking a ship to Havre along with troops and other medical personel. She tells of a rather festive atmosphere on board. When she reaches Havre she is keen to start her duties.The unknown Nurse is posted to a Hospital Train which travels to the front lines to triage the wounded and to give medical aid. She is later assigned to a Field Hospital before the Diary ends very abruptly.The writing is simplistic and straightforward, the nurse includes commentary about the weather, billets, food and the people.It almost reads as a travelogue.When she is posted to the Hospital Train and tells in a no nonsense manner of the conditions aboard Train, the writing is almost visceral.  The Nurse speaks of the mud, rain filled trenches, the constant bombardment, the casualties, the comradeship, the sacrifices, the sheer numbers of the men who fought.Other reviewers have spoken of the lack of medical procedures/diseases etc revealed, but for a diary I felt it was almost impersonal, a clinical account of events which must have been simply horrific and overwhelming.She writes of being on the train on night duty and having to care for at least 120 very sick men. No nurse to patient ratios in those days or conditions.It is the day to day struggle to care for her patients, even the enemy of occasions that I found to be quite compelling reading. It is the absolute stoicism that hits you with this very personal insight into life on the Western Front and the indefatigable spirit of the Nursing Sister.','Diary of a Nursing Sister on the Western Front, 1914-1915'),(344,'2013-06-25 00:00:00','B0083WTVT8',4,'A8DBC1RO8128K','Rating 4 Stars - Loved ItI am a huge fan of Superhero movies like X-Men, The Avengers, Fantastic Four and was excited to find a Paranormal series with yummy Superheroes.Temptress is a fun, quick read with a smidge of romance. While Temptress is trying to give ThinkTank his powers back by kissing him every time and having to spend time together until his powers are back they are slowly falling for each other. The action, nice build up to their romance worked well for me. There was not an actual love scene but a different kind of sexy fore play scene that got me hot and bothered. Loved that they were both Superheroes but deep down just ordinary people dealing with everyday life and loved that they got to see not only their superhero side but their inner side as well.The best part of the novel is that The Manhattan Ten is known in the world with no secret identity. Only got a little bit of here and there on the rest of the Manhattan Ten crew but it was enough to get me interested in them more. Love that they all have their own voice and different personalities.

This is a touching story, with Chloe feeling insecure because she\'s not California thin, blonde or tanned. As Chloe starts flirting with Jasper, with her friends\' approval, she realizes life still has a lot to offer. Love is among those things. As her confidence grows, so does her boldness. Not to mention, it is refreshing to read about mature women who still are ready to give love a go. The truth is that it is also very reassuring to read about them acting the way they probably did in college but with just a touch more confidence and poise than they had back then. The friendship between the three women--Chloe, Emma, and Taylor--is true also. The friends want to help each other to regain their footing in life again. So, this is Chloe\'s story.Chloe has to deal with finding a new job, even if Jasper manages to persuade her to start by being the hotel\'s singer. Her beautiful voice and full body bring in happy patrons every night she is performing, and soon, she and Jasper take their new relationship to the next level. They have to fight against two exes. Jasper\'s former wife wants to keep him for booty calls. Chloe\'s ex-husband shows up unexpectedly to re-kindle their marriage. When love comes knocking,Chloe is brave enough to go for it, and the ensuing hot sex and romantic moments are so sweet that I really look forward to the next book.\'The only thing I didn\'t really like in the story is that Chloe\'s friends call her a closet slut because she liked dating different men while she was in college. I have never liked the fact that girls or women are depicted as sluts just because they like sex, and I hope this will not be a part of the Next Time Around series.

A great book that I highly recommend for all ages. This is for the horse lovers,those who no little of horses,and for children. The wording can be difficult to understand at times. This is because this book was written in the 1800`s and the setting is in England with the English wording. But mostly fairly easy to understand. I cried, I laughed, i rooted for the horses,and applauded when things went well in the horses` favor. This book is great for teaching children to respect and care for animals. To consider their feelings. To put themselves in their place.

Then I got an email about the Blog Tour for this and here we are! :) I must say, I was in no way disappointed with this book. I completely fell in love with the characters and the direction the story took!Sofia has had one hard life so far. She witnessed the death of her father, along with getting a glimpse of the \"thing\" that killed him. She basically became an adult at the age of 10, due to her mother basically living in the bottom of an alcohol bottle. Her school life wasn\'t much better than her home life. She was teased for any and everything. Then again, it had been this way for as long as she can remember.Then Jason shows up in town and wouldn\'t you know it, he\'s in her class. After years of being ignored and made fun of, she couldn\'t understand why Jason was so adamant about being her friend. After some insane convincing on his part, she finally caved and embraced the friendship. The more time she spent with Jason, the more she thought she could feel herself falling for him. Along with friendship; this was an entirely new feeling for her.Insert Jason\'s bad boy brother, Robbie into the picture. What is Sophia to do when Robbie shows up? Not understanding the hostility between the brothers, she sets out to figure out just what is going on. Nothing prepared her for the shock of the truth she discovered. With Jason attempting to convince her that not only is Robbie is an evil \"non human\", but he is also the \"thing\" that killed her father. Yet something seems... off about all of this. With a new found mission, Sophia sets off to figure out the truth. What she finds out not only confuses her, but makes her realize that her heart just might lie with the other brother.Then Jason goes and chances the game completely. Same players, new script. Two brothers, one girl and many secrets. Insert Awesomeness Here!I freaking loved this book. I wish there was another word for love. I\'m sure there is, but I am also sure it\'s not the best word to describe just what kind of love I am talking about! Sophia is one epically written heroine. She is alpha all the way.

It is by no means a romance novel, and the hero of the piece, and main character, Tess; would probably cringe at her tale being thought of as such.  From the opening of the book, one is caught up in her world of secrecy, espionage, and freedom fighting to the point of reading until the book is finished.The characters, what there are of them, are well developed, but vague enough to leave room for the reader\'s mind to explore some interesting possibilities.  Like all stories, there are good and not so good characters, but it is vividly clear which is which.  Tess, Kage\'s main drive behind the force of the novel, is a strong presence with iron composure, a heart of gold, and a healthy hunger for the opposite sex once she allows her inner emotional animal out of its cage.  The author\'s descriptive capability is fine-tuned.  Whether focusing on characters, landscape, or plot, one has a clear view of his or her surrounding and the people involved in the action.The plot is original, creative, and simply a fun read, but at times falls victim to an over abundance of sexual content when a little would have gone a very long way.  The language during such times echoes the base-level animalistic sexual exploits of the main character and her bedroom interests.  The plain truth is that if one chooses the work simply to bath in sexual exploits, he or she will be disappointed, because there is an actual storyline, and it is a good one.  However, as for myself, I would have preferred a bit more detail in the story line, and a bit less detail in the erotic scenes.  I always have been one to favor a guitar\'s softer undertones, rather than blatant drum solo.  Happily, in the harmony of this tale, there was enough of a guitar\'s emotion in the underpinning to soften the pounding of the drums a bit.','Vampire Underground in No Need of Rescue'),(358,'2013-08-20 00:00:00','B0089PCUJC',5,'ATPWA38YFXZOM','Awesome sauce!!!

When forced to accompany a noble woman to her Uncle\'s home, the party is attacked by the Corscan soldiers. The Corscans do not let any enemy live during an attack and the only way to avoid death for a female is to be chosen as a prisoner bride by one of the soldiers.  When Elara is chosen by a Corscan soldier the story really begins.  I really, really liked the book up until Elara becomes separated in the Capital City of Corscan and my complaint after that point is the story seemed to be compressed and hurried.  While the rest of the story contained good character development and interactions, the very last rushed through a long time period and rushed through the climatic encounter between the two characters (I also was not convinced Elara would run away since she had been so stubborn and brave throughout the rest of the book, but it is a minor point).  I have not read anything like this story.

A fairy tale type of book that isn\'t too mushy to enjoy!  As always, in my reviews, I won\'t give too much detail from the book because I STRONGLY feel it will either give something away or a BOOK \"LONG\" REVIEW is just such a waste of EVERYONE\'S time!  (I mean really!  :)  Just my opinion.)With that said, I really like how Kristen can weave characters to the point of being able to either relate to them in some way or actually picture them as real people.  Now the only thing I didn\'t like about this book, as I am finding out with Kristen\'s earlier books, she has a little bit too much detail on things that are not all that important.  Other than that, this was another winner in my....well...book.  (HA HA HA) sorry.As you know, if you read the Blurb about the book, you have a female character who is dating a guy and ends up with his brother.  Now as bad as that sounds, it really isn\'t.  The guy she \"starts\" with is NOT who you think and the one she ends up with?  Well, let\'s just say WOW.  There are quite a few things that are going on during their time together and other characters in the story help the plot along.  You will be surprised by some of the things, or antics, a couple of other characters do and act like and you will laugh you butt off on the actions and behavior of the others.  This story is filled with love, suspense, doubt, humor, ghosts and so much more.I highly recommend this read.  Plus, a bonus, this is a stand alone book so there is no Cliff Hanger, no waiting months, years for another one and so on.

It was a nice surprise to see them as daddies, and Jackie seems really a cute kid, very loving and loved as well.

Persephone is a modern retelling of just that, the story of Persephone and Hades and how she became the Queen of the Underworld, however give me a chance to tell you why I think you will love this story too. This isn\'t your ancient story about a grumpy old God who is just bitter that he doesn\'t rule Olympus. In fact at this point Olympus has fallen and I don\'t mean some B movie involving Gerard Butler, a lot of the gods died long before Persephone was born and even longer before she knows who she is really becoming.Surprised by her mother Demeter that she is, in fact, a goddess and going to be coming into her powers as she reaches the age of adulthood, you can imagine the roller coaster of emotions that she has to deal with and then she gets attacked, only to be saved by the Lord of Darkness himself, Hades. The only way to do that, however, is to marry her and make her the Queen. Goddess, powers, attack and now queen, happy birthday to you, Persephone. All of this can understandably by a little overwhelming for a 17 year old but she actually takes it very well, which surprisingly felt alright reading it. I guess that\'s what made me like her so much, the fact that she found things out, processed them like a normal person and then accepted what was going on and found a way to deal. That isn\'t easy to do with a character and in this case it is successful. She is a goddess but Persephone feels like you and me. She isn\'t over the top or unapproachable and that\'s what made this story great. However, aking a great lead and mixing them with an awesome ensemble makes a story even better.Hades for me was the greatest part of the other characters. He is so different than other recreations I have read of him that he was interesting from the start. As we get to know him more, however, is where he really shines. Really all of the Underworld characters where great from Cassandra, Thanatos and Charon to even just the structure of the place itself made for a great place for the main characters to interact and definitely helped the story. It had lots of action and fun just like some popular series like Percy Jackson but this brought an element of both romance and realness to the Gods themselves that it made it a complete package for me.

Claire Montoya is a woman who fought her way out of a hardscrabble life and kept right on fighting through her enlistment and into a commission. She\'s a woman who follows only those rules she deems valid. Evan Loehr is a West Point grad, a by-the-book poster boy for the elite military man. He lives for and by all the rules, no questions, no evasions.From the moment they kissed they knew, absolutely knew, how incendiary their attraction was. And how completely unsuited they were for each other.Their professional relationship has grown more and more contentious as the years passed. Claire and Evan do not get along. Neither has forgotten that one moment of passion three years ago, but now that they\'re working together, they can\'t afford to dwell on it. It\'s a pity that knowing that and living it are two very different things.Colorado in winter is Claire\'s version of hell, but dealing with Army bureaucracy while trying to train a company for Iraqi deployment is definitely one of the lower levels. Nothing about the Army\'s focus for this training session makes sense to Claire, and nothing she says or does sways Evan in the least. It\'s enough to drive her out of her mind. It\'s enough to scare her senseless, too, because poorly trained soldiers are dead soldiers.If Claire takes matters into her own hands, she\'ll be forced to wage a personal war on the one man in all of Colorado who could keep her warm during the snowy nights, because for all his many, many...many faults, the fact is that Captain Evan Loehr is both a hell of a soldier and a hell of a man. She\'s left with no good options and a troubling bottom line: if she risks her career she could potentially save lives, but she\'ll definitely lose her heart.~*~I\'m so confused. It\'s been a few months since I read series (and Scott\'s authorial) debut,Because of You, but I haven\'t forgotten that the expectations and assumptions I\'d made about that book prior to reading it affected my impression of it. It was a much weightier, emotionally intense read than I was expecting, so I prepared myself for this one. Expected angst. Had tissues standing by. I was ready.Yeah, well, Scott threw me again. This time, though, I feel a little lost. On the bright side, I liked the characters well enough, and I was much fonder of Evan than I was of Shane in the first book. There wasn\'t an overload of angsty emotional landmines in the characters\' personal lives or relationship, either. Some might consider that a bad thing, but I was happy about it. The first book was just too heavy for me, especially as I was expecting a sexy, light read (the cover of that book did me no favors in that regard).Problem is, for all that I liked the characters in this book, they weren\'t the characters I was expecting, nor was the storyline what I\'d thought it was going to be. The first book left several plot threads dangling and posed a very grim glimpse into the lives of two secondary characters whose marriage was crumbling. At the conclusion of that book, I figured that was going to be a storyline that was carried over to serve as a cohesive element in the series.I was wrong, because unless I\'m mistaken or have forgotten something, there was not one single character crossover between book one and two and no story threads that were picked up and continued from there into this one. There was, however, an opening sequence that was startlingly similar to the beginning of the previous book, and not in a good way. Small details were changed, but the entire dynamic was far too similar and put this book on a shaky foundation for me from the start.You will get no argument from me about the fact that Scott can write. She paints a cohesive, detailed picture of military life that is intriguing and disturbing at turns, and as often frustrating and perplexing as humbling and amazing. The psychology of career military personnel is captured perfectly as her stories unfold. The Army itself is portrayed as having a few...idiosyncrasies that are completely realistic and utterly believable. And more than a little scary.I do wish there had been less emphasis placed on the scheduling snafu as the main conflict in this book. I absolutely believe it\'s an accurate representation of similar real-life situations, but it was belabored throughout the first half of the book to the point that ','Left Me Confused'),(383,'2013-02-25 00:00:00','B008IXE5DO',4,'A1DG765BZAZZQ','Using very witty dialogue betwixt the characters, the author exposes a gaggle of urban neuroses as experienced by a rather depressed young chap who can\'t seem to make a proper choice.

What Justyna Plichta-Jendzio has crafted here is a work of classic/traditional fantasy that weaves together interesting characters, complex monsters, and almost fairy-tale like themes.It\'s also a tale of strong women - monsters, hunters, and heroes alike - who surpass their traditional roles by putting a new spin on them. In the first tale, a beautiful young woman must do battle with the exterminators sent to hunt her down, while fighting against the darkness of her very nature. It\'s a very traditional vampire story with an edge . . . literally. The second tale turns the tables, making a woman the hunter, hot on the trail (no pun intended) of the dragon who decimated her family. She\'s a great character, but it\'s the mythology of the dragons - the velangs - that really intrigued me.The third tale is the longest of the lot, and the one that really takes us into the mythology and philosophy of Justyna\'s world. It\'s also the story with the most depth in terms of setting, introducing us to the highs and lows of society - the rich, the poor, the nobles, and the slaves. While the first two stories were largely straightforward, with a nice twist at the end, this is a tale that\'s built on betrayals. The introduction of more spiritual themes, of angels and demons, is an odd expansion of the traditional fantasy genre, but one that works.All told, these are strong stories, with interesting characters, that are well-told. I would have liked to see a bit of framing around them, something to either link them together or establish them within the larger worldview, but that\'s a minor quibble. I enjoyed my time in Naor, and would definitely be up for a return visit.','Interesting characters, complex monsters, and almost fairy-tale like themes'),(401,'2013-01-23 00:00:00','B008VETEDG',5,'A2PANHB1OFF2EE','This can\'t be all that\'s going to happen in Unique and Kennard\' s lives....

Although it had all the elements I love to have in a story, I can\'t help but think that there was something missing. I loved the concept the author, Libby Drew, brought forward - how a normal man goes from everyday life, to a life where his only purpose is to save people. Jase\'s journey through this ordeal was a trying one. Imagine not knowing your name, your age, or having no idea what you are supposed to do and running from place to place saving strangers. I could not blame him for how he felt - confused, tired and at times thinking about ending it all. It wasn\'t until he meets a man who helps him understand his mission better that he finally gets to see a blip of light at the end of the tunnel.So he goes about his mission, looking forward to that long-awaited number 40. And all hell breaks loose. He meets Lucas and Macy, his last soul to save. After some very interesting events, the three of them find themselves on the run. And here is where Lucas and Jase really connect with each other and form a bond with Macy too. I loved the dynamic between them because it felt believable. Lucas was adorable. His humor and sarcasm alone won me over. And Macy, well, she broke my heart. She was a trooper throughout it all.Then she is kidnapped and Jase\'s mission is compromised or so he thought. This is where the story dragged me down. I understand Lucas and Jase had to look at all the angles, but it felt too slow for my taste. I found myself skimming through it and going right to the dialog. In the end I didn\'t need all that narrative to know who was behind it all. I won\'t get into it much because I really don\'t want to give anything away. I\'ll just say that the author had me wondering what the hell was happening up to this point and within a couple of pages into Lucas and Jase\'s investigation I had it all figured out.Now the resolution to the plot as a whole was another story. It wasn\'t a bad resolution to the plot at all and I was not expecting it in the least, but it felt...lacking? I don\'t know if that\'s even the right word. But I was expecting something with a bit more punch. But maybe it\'s just me.All that said, I do have to say that the author really made the most out of the characters and their situation. They were funny and adorable and I liked them right away. She also went about Lucas and Jase\'s connection the right way. Anything more and their story would have been unbelievable to me and anything less would have made me lose my interest. I enjoyed their constant banter, their tender moments and how they grew throughout the story. I found the ending to be a bit abrupt but I liked it nonetheless.All in all, a good story with a very interesting storyline, a very intriguing mystery and great characters with some chemistry thrown in to the mix make it more enjoyable.','A good story with a very interesting storyline'),(413,'2013-08-21 00:00:00','B0092QBP8Y',4,'AXBPOMEELERLZ','Radiant is a quick read, a short novella chronologically set between Hallowed and Boundless, the next book in the series.  The majority of this one is centered on Angela, a character that I have been wanting more of.  She has more angel blood than Clara, but often seems to be less of an angel.  It didn\'t really progress the main story line of Clara, but it definitely explained a lot about Angela and why she is the way she is.There has always been a bit of an oddness about Angela, something that just seemed suspicious.  This novella didn\'t change that feeling for me, but instead deepened it.  I am not quite sure on which side she falls and she keeps me guessing!  I am betting that is frustrating a lot of fans, but I like the mystery it provides the story as a series.I think you could probably read Boundless without having read this and not miss anything essential.  But there is one pivotal scene in Radiant that is later referenced in Boundless.  But it is explained and described well enough in the book that it is completely understandable, even if you hadn\'t read this novella.Things to love about Radiant...--The focus on Angela.  We learn a lot about her.  She may still be mysterious, but she also seems a lot more human in this novella.

Truly, Vegas is a dangerous place to be if you can\'t hold your liquor after you\'ve picked up a date for the night.  At least that\'s my observation after reading three romance novels with that being the case.This is one that if I had paid close attention to the gist of the story before I picked it up; I probably wouldn\'t have read it.  I\'m not big on cheating and this whole story is a result of a guy lying and cheating.  It turned out that I wasn\'t as upset by the cheating as I usually am because of what else was going on in the story and its lighter tone.  I\'m not saying the ends justify the means, but in this case, everyone was much happier as a result of the things his misdemeanors set in motion so I went with it and ended up enjoying the story.Ben wakes up in his hotel room after a very debauched night on the town in Vegas and looks around with a feeling of dread on top of the hangover.  As he moves about practically tripping over the used condoms and empty bottles, he realizes that not only did he cheat on his girlfriend, but he cheated on her with a man.His best bud and co-conspirator, Lucas, tells him they\'ll keep it a secret and Genevieve need never know.  Lucas thinks Genevieve isn\'t the woman for Ben and tells him so all the time.  Ben secretly agrees on one level, but he also likes her enough to feel awful about things.  He and Lucas return to NYC to their jobs for the architect firm owned by Ben\'s dad and hopefully back to normal.  Ben tries to pretend.  Everything reminds him of Mason, the man he was with, including when he is intimate with Genevieve.  This drives him to guiltily propose to Genevieve.  He should be happy, but it feels all hollow and wrong.  He wants to love Genevieve and she makes his dad happy and he likes her too though he admits to himself that they tend to do just fine going their separate ways with her fashion design work and his job at the firm.  She doesn\'t stir him to passion anymore than he seems to stir her.  She redesigned his apartment suite and seems to want to do the same thing with his life.  They\'ve just been drifting until now.Life gets a bit more complicated when he no sooner discovers the receipt for his marriage to Mason then Mason is standing on his doorstep.  Ben wants to get rid of him even as he is secretly still attracted.  Mason discovers about Genevieve and blackmails Ben into letting him stay.  He will keep quiet about their marriage and pretend to be Ben\'s brother if Ben will let him stay long enough to find a dancing job on Broadway.  Ben has no choice if he doesn\'t want his lies to catch up with him.  Gen and Mason bristle around each other and Ben feels the discomfort of being stuck in the middle.  He grows more and more confused about what he wants with Genevieve and with life in general since he never wanted to be an architect.  Genevieve goes off to Paris for a fashion show leaving the two men alone for a week.  Ben tries to deny his feelings and attraction for Mason, but the longer they spend together it gets harder to avoid and deny.  A crisis comes that wakes him up and forces him to stop lying, but he might have put it off for too long now that Mason took him at his word and is gone.I had some real issues with this story- primarily the cheating and lying, but these were balanced out with some stuff I liked too.  Ben is the narrator and he was not a favorite of mine particularly from the beginning.  There wasn\'t a great deal to like or respect.  Let\'s just say he had a ton of growing to do, but fortunately he does end up growing.  He got himself into the mess he was in and when I say that I mean that he sat back and let his dad dictate his career to him because he wanted to please his dad, then he let Genevieve dictate how things were going to be in their relationship and private life and then he got so drunk that he married a stranger in Vegas.  He just seemed to be helpless about stuff, but then having Mason around seemed to give him a little more impetus to change.  Not as much as I would have liked because he tended to avoid further communication and confrontation with his dad and Genevieve that got things sticky again.  I didn\'t care for Genevieve and she had her own issues, but Ben didn\'t handle things well with her either.

Since I\'ve never read anything by Rebecca Cantrell, I can\'t draw any conclusions, just guesses.Here\'s the gist: a group of scientists go into an area with a deep history, go blackout (missing). A group of soldiers is sent to find the scientists and find something far worse. A strange girl is found and weird things start to happen.The start was really great, the historical background (which comes with Rollins\' territory in his research for his books) was immense and deeply satisfying for one who has an interest in obscure history (like me), the occassional quirky dialogue did, at times, get me to snort-laugh (especially the weight jokes one fat soldier throws around about himself), and the mystique of the dead language mentioned, the mystery of the little girl, and what happens in the cave at the end of the story, along with the questions the main character thinks about at the very end, it\'s all a great start to pique interests to what already seems to promise to be a complex and intriguing series.','The start of events'),(423,'2012-09-30 00:00:00','B0095ZIODQ',4,'A3RKG7R8ODW0K5','I love beef, and I love my slow cooker, so I was anxious to get this book.

It was difficult then to really flirt with someone using text messages.If sending a chain message did not get you down then perhaps hitting the send button only to realize that you have sent the message to the wrong person, more than likely would. Texting can be dangerous but there in lies the lure. Anything that has an element of danger to it is sure to get your curiosity peaked.Now we are in the age of the social media revolution with a million ways of talking to someone without actually doing it face to face. I have had the very amusing experience of having someone text me while we were sitting at the same table having a conversation with a few other companions. At first I thought it was a bit ridiculous but then it got interesting when my mate sent me a very sensual message that I did not know quite how to respond to at the time.I was \'text\' challenged and I have been that way for quite some time, so finding this book was very interesting for me. It\'s a bit late because I would have liked to have had it when I was dating but not now that I am married it makes for good fun.

This book would help people who don\'t know for sure if they are an introvert but notice a difference in their personality.  Amber Keyes explains different techniques you can use in order to fit in with the extroverts and get your job done. And for being a great boss, well that takes skills you can learn from management courses. If you are not good at getting into other peoples faces and visa versa then become your own boss somehow or work at another level.  At times in the book she  practically gives you step by step directions on what to do in certain situations.  This may come in handy one day if you can remember them, but given her line of work, explaining what she does to get through the day would not help anyone unless they had the same job.  I have read a few books on being an introvert and I have come to the conclusion that there is no special way to know the situations you will get into that makes you feel uncomfortable whether an introvert or extrovert. Just be yourself and don\'t be so hell bent to fit in everywhere. There are a lot of extroverts that are introverts and at the end of their day I\'m sure they are mentally exhausted. I truly don\'t want to have to stay on my P\'s & Q\'s to make sure all is well with my relationship to the world and the people in it. I believe the only advantage to being an introvert is that you have more creativity and you give your thoughts to more than just how many friends you can collect on Face Book. Science and technology are ruled by introverts. So I say don\'t categorize yourself into one group or the other because YOU are YOU.  As the book suggested, you may need to hone your skills for small talk in order to be polite but hopefully it may turn into a small, interesting talk, you never know.

You totally need to read this book on your own to see just how amazing and awesome it is. Having Aphrodite and Ares together, fighting over the souls and both working their magic over these humans lives makes the book so much more interesting.  The human characters as so well developed that you can easily fall in love with them and then become angry when Ares interferes. Oh I just adore this book!It isn\'t just your standard love story.

I am not in the business of bashing authors because I don\'t personally like their book. And, I want to be supportive of independent and relatively unknown authors. That being said, when I read a book like this, I feel that it is my job as a reviewer to set aside the possible hurt feelings of the author and tell my readers my honest opinion.I so wanted to like this book. The premise sounded interesting: A girl begins to see some kind of supernatural being (fairies or sprites) after a near death experience. She falls in love with one of them despite the danger involved for both of them. Forbidden love, a hot fairie guy, danger - what\'s not to like, right? Wrong...First, the writing. There were a lot of awkward sentences, some misused idioms, overuse of certain phrases, words that were technically correct but not \"current\" and sentences that just plain did not make sense. Now, this could be the case for one of 2 reasons:One, the author is originally from Poland and is not a native English speaker - thus the problems listed above. If this is the case I would recommend that she find a native English speaker or editor to help her polish this up. Two, the main character is originally from Russia and would therefore likely speak in broken English. The book was written in first person present tense so the entire book is right from her mind/mouth. If this is the reason for the above problems, I understand wanting to keep the character authentic, but the language really detracted from my enjoyment of the book. I would recommend that the book not be written in first-person from Ania\'s point of view.Second, the plot. There were a ton of inconsistencies and holes in this plot that made me go \"Huh? Whaaaat?\" For example, Gabriel (the Sprite love interest) states on more than one occasion that it is against the rules for them to be together and that the penalty for them speaking is death. However, he also states on more than one occasion that this has never ever happened before, in all the centuries that they have existed. If this is true, why would such a rule even exist? In the last couple of pages there\'s an event that seems like a heck of a coincidence. I won\'t say more as I don\'t want to spoil anything but suffice it to say that the particular scene was inconsistent and seemed like it was added in almost as an afterthought to make the storyline work.Third, I really hated Ania. She is the main character so I suppose one would expect to feel some kind of connection there but I just did not like the girl. She was completely immature and a major drama queen. She has an overbearing mother, but her mother obviously cares about her. It\'s not an abusive relationship or anything. At one point in the book Ania cuts all ties with her and states that she is \"just another woman named Natasha that I once knew.\" That seems quite extreme to me. Also, she sees Gabriel a couple of times and even admits (more than once) how arrogant he is. Yet, after the first time he kisses her she is \"in love!\" Ridiculous! She knows absolutely nothing about this guy (or Sprite, as the case may be), his culture, his family, etc.. but she\'s in love with him! She is also the QUEEN of mixed messages. She sends him away and then is angry when he\'s not there. He leaves for a trip and she\'s angry that he\'s gone. She was whiny, immature, overly dramatic and generally unlikeable.I gave an extra star for the overall idea of the book. I think if the writing were smoother and the plot and details fleshed out a little more this could be great. The idea of fairies as guardians instead of angels was intriguing to me. The very small glimpses I got of their society was intriguing to me. I can see the potential here and give the author credit for putting an original spin on the idea of fairies and angels.Overall, there were more negatives than positives for me personally. I was unable to overlook a lot of the awkward writing and plot inconsistencies. However, if you are looking for something a little different and like a good love story with a little bit of a mystery thrown in, you may enjoy this one.Note: I received a copy of this book for free from the author in exchange for my honest review.

There is even some eyebrow raising humor mixed in there. The stories revolve around the common theme of a necklace found in various compromising situations - usually murder.I finished the anthology in a few sittings. About 99% of the stories were interesting to read and kept my attention. Having a variety of different authors and their styles one after the other made the book easy to read.My favorite story was &#34;The Needing&#34; by PJ Friel. I was instantly wrapped up in the story and loved the twisted, very wrong, but very right in a very wrong way (haha!), ending.One of the stories I simply skipped through because due to the violent, abusive nature of the repulsive main character (&#34;The Trophy Wife&#34; by Killion Slade).

Its major attraction is the strange dog-like mascot, the rougarou, located in the center of town. Resa\'s sentiments about her home town can be summed up as follows: &#34;Dogtown was like quicksand; unless one kept moving, getting stuck was inevitable, followed by sinking and suffocation.&#34;Coincidentally, Resa\'s old school friend Chan (Chandler) Caillou has just moved back to Dogtown to take over his family\'s alligator wrangling business. He states, &#34;It was my responsibility, you know? Sometimes we\'re born into a situation and we have to decide if we\'re gonna be a part of it or if we\'re gonna put an end to it.&#34; According to both their families, Resa and Chan are destined to be married.

Perhaps in a revision, they could consider putting in some basic spice mix recipes, and enchilada sauce mix recipes for those of us that don\'t have the great supermarkets that the US does. If they did that - I\'d happily revise my review to 5 stars.It doesn\'t talk too much about spices - but that\'s ok... I\'ll just bang some in to my taste... as the book suggests.What I really did like, was that it contained quite a few recipes I hadn\'t stumbled across before.  This isn\'t a book about how to make fajitas, enchiladas and chili con carne - it\'s much more than that.I\'d recommend it to people who like cooking the usual Mexican fayre at home... and are interested in adding a few more recipes to their repertoire.','Easy peasy'),(490,'2013-03-05 00:00:00','B00A8MNGBA',5,'A1IBWCEIHX6DQ5','The continuation of volume 7 Bang was certainly a breath taking one.

Ally\'s used to being the apple of her father\'s eye but Matt now holds a special spot in her father\'s heart as he admires his work ethic and ability to rebuild his life after a tragedy.Ally\'s initial reaction to Matt is one of suspicion that grows as she overhears many conflicting comments from him that bring out the worst in her.  She appears a bit elitist at first as she resents Matt\'s being so close to her father.  She\'s jealous and thinks he\'s out to hurt her father which soon proves false as a tragic accident has Matt coming to the rescue.  It\'s hard for her to get past the thoughts in her head which leads to a regrettable decision to run which is not at all thought out.  Her impulsiveness again shows her in a bad light and these fits of immaturity exasperated me.On the other hand Matt comes off as playful.  He\'s not offended by her snobbiness and gives just as good as he gets.  He\'s had a traumatic past that he doesn\'t want to rehash, he just wants to move on from it. He doesn\'t know why he\'s drawn to Ally, he just is.  They\'re very different people but something about the ranch brings them closer together as shows Ally in a much better light, it\'s a softer side not hardened by the big city.I never found their romance to be completely believable, but it is hot.

Stone\'s novel, Boots on the Ground, two gay police officers from Canada are voluntarily serving in Afghanistan to help construct a civilian police force. The story begins when they become the only survivors of a horrific insurgent IED attack on the convoy in which they are traveling, near the end of the terms of their service.They end up together with a missing-in-action British nurse, Karen, in a labyrinth of caves, as the guests--or captives?--of \"friendly\" Afghans who are well aware they can\'t openly oppose the insurgents who control the area.So it\'s a torturous attempt by Karen, Ash, an Edmonton police officer, and Jason, a Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer stationed in New Brunswick, to go home. If only Ash and Jason can get their damaged cell phones to work again.And, to up the ante, Ash and Jason are married--but not to each other. Matthew, a nurse, is Ash\'s husband. David, a fellow RCMP officer, is Jason\'s.The story provides the reader with a great deal of the lives of Ash and Jason in Canada before they began their adventure together in Afghanistan. It also keeps us in touch with Matthew and David and all their families as Ash and Jason go from missing to presumed dead.Boots on the Ground brings to the reader\'s attention a matter I hadn\'t previously focused on. All the military and police authorities involved, as well as the families and friends of Ash and Jason and their husbands, make every effort to mislead the media into believing the two men are straight. If two openly gay men fell into the hands of the insurgents, they would be killed. In fact, Ash and Jason pass themselves off as straight men to the Afghans they live with because those \"friendly\" Afghans would also kill them if they thought they were gay.To say I became emotionally involved in this story is to state the obvious. Going home, Odysseus and Dorothy would no doubt agree, is one of the most heart-rending stories of them all. But getting home alive and well is no guarantee.And so, quite a few more times than once, this reader found himself in tears.Thank you, Angela, for this novel.(As first reviewed on Rainbow Book Reviews.

I liked that the subject matter was one not normally discussed in a romance novel so I was looking forward to seeing how the story progressed while Tae and Max were dealing with that roadblock.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed.It started off great.  I liked Tae, especially when she first met Max and convinced him to show her his deformed hand so that he wouldn\'t have to hide it from her anymore.  That was pretty awesome - it was also the highlight of the book.  It all went downhill from there. Because Max was able to finally show Tae his hand, that gave her the right to barge in on him while he was in the shower so she could see the rest of his injuries?  When they\'ve only just met and HE\'S HER BOSS??  Seriously?  Way too far over the top.  And then, the minute she does that, they are in love.  Give me a break.  I almost stopped reading at this point but was curious to see what happened next.Minor spoilers:  What happened next is that Tae, who was a housekeeper with no computer skills (couldn\'t even type) magically becomes Super Corporate Woman and fixes Max\'s business, when he couldn\'t.  She tells him the best way to proceed to correct a design flaw in a big project, she uncovers corporate espionage, overhauls his company\'s pay scales and improves the morale of 1000 employees.  All in a couple of weeks.  Yet she\'s too dumb to realize she might be pregnant.  Grrrrr.I will say that what I did like about it (and the only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 2) was that Max wasn\'t magically \"fixed\" in the end.  I appreciated the realism in that aspect but the rest of it was just crazy unbelievable.Proofreading and editing issues but not too overly distracting.

I hope there will be another book that continues on this same story line. If so, I might like this book more. Unlike Blacque/Bleu(book one) which can be read as stand alone, this book isn\'t, in my opinion. It introduces the main couple for this story and their background. It introduces the major issue that keeps them from being together, which is resolved. My issue is that the author brings up other issues that aren\'t resolved. I\'ll include them later on as a \'spoiler\'. So, you have been warned.Travis is the younger brother of Lukas Blaque. They share same father, who is the alpha of the local pack. His father is the most dominate wolf in the pack. His mother is the local Omega. She is the \'weakest\' werewolf in the pack and the other females tend to treat her like trash and walk all over her. She prefers to avoid confrontation. She is also their healer. Travis looks like his mother, not very masculine. He feels he takes after his mother not his father. He doesn\'t realize he is more dominate. He thinks he is one of the weakest werewolfs because of his mother and doesn\'t want people to walk over him.Travis is very self conscious about how people view him. He is attracted to both men and women, though he is denial about his attraction towards men. He feels that his pack will find him \'weak\' because of it. He does not think he is maculine looking/dominate as his gay brother, Lukas. One night he goes out to the local hangout to drink and act a fool towards everyone. He is a bit childish. While he is there, he sees a very attractive man. He feels drawn to him, but is in denial about it. Travis ends up ticking off the wrong guys who decide to \'teach\' him a lesson.Dylan, isn\'t human. He is bounded by a contract with a evil person. His contract is almost up though and he is happy because of it. His last person he needs to find and bring to his boss alive, is in Arcada. He has been trying for a while to find a way into Arcada. He is at the local hangout(right outside of Arcada) when he sets his eyes on a very attractive, fiesty, young werewolf. He feels drawn to him, though he trys to fight it. When Travis is in trouble, Acradia sends Dylan to the rescue.Dylan ends up taking Travis to his hotel room because there is to much snow. As they spend time together, they bond. Dylan is sad when Travis leaves to go home. When Travis meets yet more drama on the way home, Dylan risks his life to save Travis.

How far will Travis go to keep Dylan by his side?*KINDA SPOILER*  Rogue, crazy-in-the-head werewolves attack Travis and his brother on the way back to Arcada. Dylan, along with Travis\'s pack, end up coming in and saving them. Dylan is injuried badly and it takes weeks for him to recover. Even though, he is finally in Arcada, we don\'t focus to much on him finding his last target, but more on his bonding with Travis. They are meant for each other. They both fall in love with each other. The pack asks for Dylan\'s help with the three rogue werewolves they had brought back. Deacon is one of the rogue werewolves. With Dylan and Arcada\'s help, he gets more control over his mind and reality.They find out that Deacon\'s alpha hooked up with some demon who wants Arcada. It is this demon that is the reason they are all crazy in the head. Travis\'s \'uncle\' James, who\'s gay, is best friends with his mother, Melody. When Melody walks in the room, where Deacon is held prisoner, James and him go at it. They were challenging each other over Melody, as a mate.

To explain, I am a HUGE fan of John Grisham and will read anything he writes; however, his endings are a bit of a letdown for me.  The same can be said of the recent stories that I have read by this author,  however, unlike the perdurable loyalty I have for Grisham (because I don\'t really expect to go away with a warm, fuzzy feeling after reading a legal thriller anyway), the same cannot be said in this case.  I am tired of having great romance stories ruined by a not so great ending.  Yes, it\'s important to give the couple their HEA, but it\'s just as important to tie up lose ends.  Please don\'t make something an important part of the story if you have no intentions of concluding it.  Seriously, just don\'t start it if you\'re not going to bring it to conclusion because it just irks me to no end to be left hanging.I  would definitely recommend this story because it is a great holiday romance.

Although it still had its moments, I wouldn\'t say it was a good as the first two either nor as memorable.  Possibly as it was a little predictable due to the character traits, and there weren\'t as many characters (or reviewers of products) as in the other books. The fact it\'s about politicians also means it\'s a bit limited to where it can go humour wise too I guess.  But as I said it has its moments, like a politician who got caught drying himself down below with a hairdryer by the paparazzi, or the paper airplane attack by one who has a seat in parliament outside of the camera\'s eye.

I was not disappointed at all.  I spent most of the day reading this which is unusual for a book of this length, I couldn\'t put it down.The story goes like this briefly:  A specially trained operative on the run in modern day U.S.A. takes a chance to escape our world to time-travel to an long ago era of her family\'s ancestral origins.  While unsure what she would find, she keeps to her code taught to her & she does find acceptance, love & so much more.  In this place she fits in as a woman warrior (think valkrye) around 9th century Vikings & she thrives. There were not many times a woman like that would be accepted \"as is\" in the entire history of our planet.  It really sets this story apart and I loved it!  Adventure, humor, mystery, beauty and romance are the basics but told in such depth you will feel as if you are there experiencing it with her or even with others.  It is that good.I encourage anyone to read this who wants more from the historical/action romances \"smut\" that is not commonly written today which is more sex than story. There is so much more to life & this book has it!  Sure there is romance but it\'s only apart of this epic tale.  This novel stands apart & is a shining example of an excellent novel & is also well written.  It is worth the money!  I would have paid more if I was familiar with the author.

Also, the use of the term \"state of the art\" occurred often, but there was nothing to base that off of. This was obviously a futuristic story, but what is state of the art when it comes to a world that\'s already going to be state of the art to the reader of today?I also had questions arise near the end (which I won\'t get into due to them spoiling things). The characters knew more than I did as a reader, and I think that it limited my understanding of why some themes were brought up in the end.All in all, with me still having questions and also zipping right through this one, I think I\'ll be looking forward to book 2, \"The Coming,\" when it is released.','Review: The Eslites, by CM Doporto'),(556,'2013-12-08 00:00:00','B00AVXBE60',4,'AX7NOMC2X8NTU','This book was pretty good.

(quote) \"A dystopia is the opposite of a utopia. It appears in many artistic works, particularly in stories set in the future. They are often characterized by dehumanization, totalitarian governments...or other characteristics associated with a cataclysmic decline in society.\" (end of quote)- Wikipedia\"Electronic Gags\" by Kudakwashe Muzira fits the above definition perfectly. It is set in a totalitarian USA governed by a military dictator. The protagonist is a biologist named Freddie, who is a rebel. He is the only person to safely get away from a police raid on a secret rebel meeting. Michael, his best friend, is put on death row. Freddie will try to save his friend and his country.With this plot, you will be reminded of Orwell\'s 1984. In the real world, you will be reminded of Mandela\'s fight against apartheid in South Africa, King\'s struggle for civil rights in the USA, and Ghandi\'s nonviolent resistance in India, which led to its independence from England.Suffice it to say that the memory of mankind is fragile. Consequently, there will always be a place for books such as this one, which helps mankind to remember past mistakes, and hopefully, avoid repeating them. If this book helps us to do that, then it is a fitting tribute to the memory of Mandela, King and Ghandi.

However, her art comes from the nightmares that she has constantly had since the deaths of her parents and they flow onto the canvas.I enjoyed the twist of the bible in this story and how the author was able to turn the stories that I learnt growing up to form her own story. In TMOA we briefly meet a lot of characters from the bible but together their stories are different to what we all know.

I felt that this book seem to have a more \'serious\' tone to it. Let me explain...It had a few areas where our \'boys\' had moments of quiet reflection and personal contemplation as they pondered their raison d\'tre.And while it still had areas that were humorous, it seemed to lack those numerous special moments that had me chuckling to myself (when I wasn\'t laughing out loud)... something that seemed to occur with more regularity in the first book.That being said... this is still a great tale, well told. There is a definitive professional feel to the quality of story-telling that shines through from the first to last page.And despite my minor concern regarding the humor aspect of this book, it is still 5 StarsRay Nicholsonraynicholsonsreviews@hotmail.com','Clint and Edward\'s quest continues... with a slight change in focus.'),(582,'2013-06-26 00:00:00','B00B54TZA6',3,'A2CC8FRA0J2GXE','The Roots of Evil - the fourth in the Doctor Who 50th anniversary short stories, penned by Philip Reeve (another author I\'ve read before but not been wowed by) - turned out to be a rather nice little story.The plot was serviceable, and Leela as the companion fit well into this particular tale, set in a huge tree as it was, and the Doctor was recognisable and the story felt fitting for Four. So in that sense, everything was fine, but somehow the story still felt a little ... not sure how to put it, but lacking something? The conclusion came too quickly and easily, perhaps.

There is a narrator who occasionally makes comments and is also good at giving definitions and explanations where needed. The second thing is that while this is written somewhat like a fairytale, it is most definitely not for children. The evil is concrete whether it is being perpetrated by humans or extraterrestrial beings. In places it is downright gruesome.The story is about Gavin who, through no true fault of his own and along with his much beloved young wife, is brutally assaulted and then murdered by a group of thugs who he was unfortunate enough to have to work with.At the same time we have Saul, a very powerful demon. Saul was so powerful he took on Lucifer in a bid to be number one. Didn\'t work out well for him and he ended up trapped in a warehouse located on hallowed ground. So he\'s looking for a surrogate. Which leads him to Gavin. We now have a demon who wants out of his prison and one very unhappy soul who wants vengeance. It\'s a match made in...well certainly not heaven.To fight this darkness is Clara and a tapestry which her family has kept for generations. There have been stories about the importance of it but nothing has ever come of them. Until now. As Saul and Gavin begin their deadly games Clara is informed that the time has come for the fulfillment of the tapestry\'s purpose. The purpose? To save the world from darkness and utter destruction. Clara is understandably a bit overwhelmed. With her friend, Seb, she will travel her preordained path in terror, awe, anger, and a determination to set things right.This was a good story. It was a bit slow in places but it\'s made up for through the originality of the tale and a few surprising twists I never saw coming- which is fairly rare for me anymore. The ending made me think that there may be a sequel. If it happens there is no doubt that I will be ready and waiting to see what comes next.','Fighting Darkness'),(585,'2013-03-25 00:00:00','B00B5XDXPA',4,'A23W4VL6UFPJ0N','This book gives loads of detail and background information into the reason behind why the characters are as close as they are.

The characters come at the plot in a unique was the heroine is a police officer, not someone you would think of as a submissive and the Hero doesn\'t realize he has Dom tendencies. The first time Delia and Colin were involved it was hot but they weren\'t together long enough for Delia to reveal her desire to be a sub now she is drawn back into a case with Colin and it has a BDSM connection.I enjoyed the heroine being almost an alpha dom in her job and a natural sub in her relationship with Colin, I loved Colin he was so turned on and so bemused by it.

I put it down a couple of times thinking I would not pick it back up and just move on to another book, But I found myself picking it up again until I decided to push through to the end. It just would not leave my mind.The other reason that this was an odd read for me was that I loved the characters, but disliked  the world of the story. A dust land full of dust and dust and dust.. yeah that is redundant isn&#8217;t it. There was a lack of variety in this story&#8217;s settings. To me, it felt like I was watching a two setting stage play. First this room (stage), fade black. Light second stage, Fade to black. Repeat.  My mind was crying out for depth and variation.Yet the characters were well written, rich and full of complexity. It is the characters&#8217; stories; their emotions, their motivation and hardships that makes this book.The theme of this story is bleak. The overall tone of it is depressing, to the point that I&#8217;d call it a tragedy.It is the same message as many of the environmental apocalyptic stories out there, but it is the telling of this one that stays with you.Judging from the ending, I would assume that there is a sequel and oddly enough if there is, I would read it.Do I recommend this book? Yes, but I&#8217;m not promising a five star read, just an interesting read that keeps the reader wondering.NOTE: There were parts in this story that had graphic violence.

I got this as a Kindle freebie and as with freebies, they\'re either a hit or miss for me. To Know Her was hands down a hit for me.The story opens with Sara hitchhiking on the side of the road at night with no form of memory whatsoever. She doesn\'t recall how she ended up there; she doesn\'t even know her own name. Luckily, Sara is saved by Derek who takes her to his home to care for her. Being cared by Derek and being in his home gives her a sense of comfort and familiarity, yet Derek is nothing but a mere stranger to her.While reading, I had a knowing sense of what was going on, yet I didn\'t and I believe that\'s what made this read so interesting and a page-turner.  There was a little pinch of suspense/mystery laced into the story that had me questioning a few things and curious to find out what happened to Sara and who was Derek, this man who conveniently appeared out of nowhere in the middle of the night to rescue Sara.To answer the questions posed in my head, I eagerly read on to uncover the whole truth and I have to admit, it was quite surprising, but pretty brilliant. I really liked the little twist at the end and how the story wasn\'t so predictable where I knew exactly what happened.Overall, I am impressed. To Know Her was more than I expected and I am glad I took a chance on this little gem. This novella packed in a whole lot; I got a whole story out of 17,000 words (69 pages) and was not in the least disappointed. Sara and Derek\'s story was sensually erotic, romantic, emotional, and thoroughly satisfying.I highly recommend To Know Her for fans who like romance with a not-so-typical plot, a sexy & dominant hero and love scenes that not only make your heart race, but your toes curl. But, seriously those love scenes were fog-up-your-ereader-and-set-off-your-fire-alarm-hot! ;)Simply put, I highly enjoyed To Know Her and am excitingly looking forward to Renee Burke\'s next story.','To Know Her by Renee Burke'),(616,'2013-08-22 00:00:00','B00BI4PRIC',5,'AD342OQX4EFN7','Natasha writes great books and this one was not a let down!

And with the help of a mentor and a lot of cash, Liv\'s dream of owning a bakery is finally coming to fruition. After working her way successfully through the ranks of her mentor\'s bakery and being a part-time bartender, Liv is ready to branch out on her own. The pressure is on to make her sweet treats the best, but with supportive friends surrounding her, Liv is ready for the challenge. What Liv hadn\'t anticipated was to get involved in a different kind of venture altogether - a more personal one. Just as her business is about to open its doors, the man of her dreams steps in and refuses to let her hesitancy sway him. He\'s everything Liv never thought she was missing in her life and for the first time ever she is contemplating letting another man into her heart. And just when Liv thought she was safe to give in to that temptation, the sweet smell of personal and professional success quickly turns sour. Now she must decide if any of it is worth picking up the pieces.\"For the love of all cupcakes, please don\'t let this man take my heart.\"Jake is on the hunt for a prestigious promotion and nothing and no one is going to get in his way, but he didn\'t count on a sweet smelling slip of a woman to be his downfall. If only she wasn\'t the \"mission\" his boss wanted him to complete in order to land the job, then falling into bed with her wouldn\'t be a problem. Just when Jake thinks things can\'t get anymore complicated, the \"spark\" his grandfather told him about is exactly what he finds with Liv. The woman of his dreams just couldn\'t have come into his life at a worse time or under worse circumstances. The more Jake gets to know Liv, the worse the temptation becomes to give in to the chemistry between them, but the lies are mounting. Now Jake has to figure out a way of how to have his cake and eat it too before it\'s too late.Deception, sex, cupcakes, and chemistry - quite an intriguing combination and wow did it work for this story! Between the underlying saboteur plotline, the effects of a deadbeat dad, a misunderstood womanizer, and getting all hot and bothered by Jake and Liv\'s sexually charged encounters, the pages just seem to fly while reading. Add in a humorous group of friends and many delicious references to cupcakes with a naughty tip on how to use frosting for things other than just eating it and you have the recipe for a fantastic read!It was refreshing to read a male lead that is sweet and romantic instead overbearing and extremely alpha, which seems to be all the craze these days. This is not to say Jake\'s character isn\'t instinctive in both protection and possession of Liv and he takes care to prove it throughout the story. And I liked that the lust wasn\'t immediately acted upon, so the buildup was that much more for when it finally happened. Both characters are likable and possess a depth that is nicely drawn out in the story. The road to Jake and Liv\'s HEA is definitely not a cakewalk, but neither is it as confrontational as I would have expected. A couple events left me wanting a bit more after all was revealed. It just seemed to be that the people involved got off a little too easy. Aside from that, I thoroughly enjoyed getting to know the two main characters and their eccentric friends and wouldn\'t mind stories on them.In the mood for a scrumptious read with just A Taste of Trouble? Then this one\'s for you! But beware you may experience a craving for cupcakes (among other things) while enjoying this story.','Steamy story... with icing on top!'),(625,'2013-07-11 00:00:00','B00BMM5M3A',5,'A2P32KZF47D5S4','I had pre-ordered this book months ago and I must say that it was definitely worth the wait.  I love the characters that Elle Kennedy creates.I really loved this book.  If you\'ve read any of previous reviews you may know that I enjoy erotic romance and one of those reasons is because I starting reading Elle Kennedy\'s books.  This book has such a great plot with believable characters that I found myself invested in immediately.  My heart broke for Claire, Dylan, and Aidan at different times throughout the book, and had me cheering for them at others.This is book 9 in the Out of Uniform series.  I have read all of the previous books so I was aware of the back-story between these two/three characters.  You would not necessarily need to read the previous books to enjoy this one but if you like erotic romance and menage stories I would suggest picking them up as they are great reads.  Ms. Kennedy writes fabulous sex scenes with great menage where each character is included and you don\'t feel like one person is always left out.  This is not a contemporary romance, this is a contemporary erotic romance.

Everyone has their own taste in books and what they enjoy. I do not judge people by what they like although if I can find something that we both agree is good I can get lost for hours talking about books. I made comment about Kally\'s book with Damian and how there is a breath play scene that was just plain hot beyond all belief and there wasn\'t even any sex. We spent some time talking about that and I told her and the other woman that I love a good dark read. I personally love capture fantasy, rape play as well as breath play. For me Edge play is just great reading as far as I am concerned. I got a message from Kally telling me about this series. She had told me she didn\'t know many books that have capture fantasy in them but when she found out about this one she wanted to share. I was excited but all I was able to do at the time was add it to my to read list.I was finally able to read it when the awesome author sent me a message and asked if I would be interested to read the first book in her series, she is in a book group I am in as well and saw that I was looking for capture fantasy reads. I jumped on that and said absolutely.Before I get into the book I will start by saying that what bothers me more than anything else is reading reviews of books by people who do nothing but complain &#34;I don\'t know why anyone would want that to happen to them, I don\'t know why any woman would ever agree to get into that type of relationship, It is abuse, It is wrong, blah blah blah...&#34; If you are reading this story it is hard to understand HOW you wouldn\'t know what you were getting into. I mean COME ON there is a warning at the end of the synopsis! Why be completely disgusted when you know what was coming for the most part? Don\'t search out these types of books if they are not for you...That being said in case you are not aware... THIS BOOK MAY NOT BE FOR EVERYONE...THERE ARE THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN THIS BOOK THAT NOT EVERYONE WILL ENJOY READING.Warning: Capture fantasy; dubious consent; anal play; M/f as well as one m/f/f/m scene; BDSM themes including caning, spanking, bondage, and needle play. Also contains one beginner Dom who is exploring sadism but is still working out how and when to stop.About this book...overall I did enjoy it. I wasn\'t so sure there at the beginning though. I was trying to figure out what was going on. There was this idea Jodie has that she could make money on doing a documentary on the whole capture fantasy that so many women have. Klaus (an ex of hers) agrees reluctantly because he doesn\'t want her to find some random person to do it and possibly hurt her. There is an agreement and a contract, a list of rules and what not as well. And don\'t get me wrong, I completely understand that this is something that has to be determined beforehand (safe, sane & consentual) but for me at first I was kind of wondering if I was going to enjoy this read because it all seemed a little &#34;too&#34; planned out.I don\'t want to give away anything because well I hate spoilers but I will say that when they get to the house that she has set up with a \'prison\' in the basement for herself, she walks in and says okay. He then locks her in and walks away. I mean I instantly had thought &#34;Well that isn\'t much of a capture if she just walked in willingly and didn\'t even pretend to fight like she was actually being captured.&#34; I wouldn\'t say I had lost interest in the story but it was starting to drift down the road of disappointment at that point. Because I was expecting something all together different.Now, don\'t let that disappoint you. I had a friend that did read it tell me they didn\'t like that it was all planned out a little too much. I honestly believe for it to work out well you have to 1) trust the person 2) have your boundaries (limits) 3) TRUST THE PERSON. Well things change... at about 20% into the story things take a turn and I have to say that I was instantly drawn in and wanted to know more, wanted to know what was going to happen and how things would play out from there on.One of the things I did enjoy VERY much','NOT FOR EVERYONE'),(637,'2013-07-27 00:00:00','B00BOW41P8',4,'A1PGC1GEBY9CZU','I\'m not usually keen on online news sources.

It was a quick, easy read and the plot flowed really well. The characters were likable and I quite enjoyed reading it.Paige is on her way to college in the fall so her parents decide to drag her to the mountains of Vermont for a summer RV trip. She is less than thrilled to spend her summer away from her friends and in the middle of nowhere. However, her first day there she meets Travis, the son of the campground owners, and there is an instant connection. The more time they spend getting to know eachother, the harder they fall. However, there\'s a secret hanging between them and when it comes out it may be impossible to get over.I liked Paige and the fact that she wasn\'t a spoiled rich girl, which she had the potential to be. She was very charitable and not judgemental at all. Even though Travis was from money like she was, it isn\'t evident by looking at him and she never thought twice about getting to know or fall for him. She was so trusting and maybe a little nave. Even though the other girls at the camp shunned her at first, she was still kind to them and helped them when they needed her.Travis is down to earth, sweet and seems like a total package. He comes from money like Paige, but you would never know by his attitude and his hard work ethic. He went through a rebel stage and is all tattooed up so he is definitely the type to be judged even though he shouldn\'t be. I really liked Travis and I could tell his feelings for Paige were real and genuine. That is what made his betrayal so much harder to take. I never expected this from Travis and I was honestly surprised.I actually really enjoyed the plot of Inspire and the way the story flowed smoothly. It was a light fun read about young romance and I was able to get into it easily. Travis and Paige definitely had chemistry and I really liked them together. However, Travis wanted to keep it a secret and at first it didn\'t seem like a big deal since some of the girls were less than friendly with Paige. However, as the girls softened to Paige and became friendly with her, it was clear that Travis was hiding something because he didn\'t want to go public with Paige. When the truth came out, my heart broke for Paige. She was so in love with Travis and she felt betrayed. I was definitely disappointed in Travis myself but in the end he did prove himself to Paige and me as well.While I really enjoyed this book and it was easy to get into and read, I did have a few issues. I am not a big fan of insta-love and this book definitely had it. Travis and Paige were saying \"I love you\" and declaring love for each other after 2 dates and that was way too fast for me. While they spent a lot of time getting to know each other and connecting in those few days, they still moved way too quickly in my opinion. Also, I thought that the quick turnaround of the other girls in camp was a little unrealistic. One minute they are being snotty bitches to Paige and the next minute they are spilling their secrets to her like best friends. I felt like it would take a little more time to change their attitudes. Despite these small issues, I really enjoyed Inspire and I look forward to reading Britney\'s story in Forgiveness.','Sweet & Romantic'),(673,'2014-05-08 00:00:00','B00C52XZIA',1,'ALVOU8APYJM5U','I knew it was about a gay guy...fine with that.

The male/female POV.  Superb!  I SO loved Valentina (Tina) Tomic\'s character.  How can you not?!?  She\'s so genuine....so human!  She\'s kind hearted, honest and selfless; she\'s \"down-to-earth\".  REAL.  The stuff that spews out of her mouth, without forethought, is delightfully delicious...which only makes her more endearing.  She\'s perfectly lovable.  She\'s a free spirited butterfly who is full of trust and love.  There is no facade with Tina.  No hidden agenda.  She\'s simply and innocently friendly.  And she\'s also dealing with wounds from a profound loss.  Deep inside she\'s very damaged.Tina, 26.. owns her own Clothing Boutique in NY, right across the street from Nikolai Leokov\'s Night Club.  She see\'s him come outside everyday, three times a day, for a smoke.  Watching him get\'s her curiosity churning...Nikolai Leokov is a 34 year old owner of a Night Club.  He\'s a handsome, but very private man, who\'s devoted to his family.  He doesn\'t \"do\" relationships, but rather prefers bed buddies, and moves on.  No ties.  Nik doesn\'t give his trust easily...his experience with money hungry women is high.  So when Tina comes into his life, he\'s naturally skeptical, and stand-offish - - but Tina is genuine.  She\'s all that she appears to be; friendly and open...and when she realizes that Nik is suspicious of her motives (she chuckles to herself)...when she understands that he thinks she\'s \"after him\", she quickly clears things up by suggesting they be friends.  Only friends.  Nothing more.  ...game on!I absolutely loved this story of false assumptions, romance, and a little bit of mysterious intrigue.  Small bits of Organized Crime added more flavor.  I thought this Author did a fabulous job of delivering a commanding, romantic plot with lot\'s of humorous moments and dialogue.  I thought the narrative and dialogue was nicely balanced.  I loved the impromptu words that shoot out of Tina\'s mouth at any given moment.  She\'s absolutely, delectably hilarious.I adored the sub-characters and their devotion to each other.  Ghost, Max, Trick, Nat, Mimi, Lola...all such great personalities.  This author does a suburb job with character description and reinforces it throughout the book.  The plot never unravels or disintegrates.  The story kept me captivated and laughing throughout.  I loved that Tina was Nik\'s saving grace, and he was hers.Yes, there were a few misplaced and misspelled words.  Who cares?  It\'s nothing that anyone with any sense can\'t figure out.  This is this Authors\' first book and I\'m sure it wasn\'t picked up by any major Publishing House which simply means this Author published her own work.

The action begins right away as Keiko discovers a hidden world behind a tori gate in Tokyo. I liked Keiko right away, and the mystery she discovers pulled me into the book. It seems Keiko\'s entire life has been hidden away from her, a life entwined with Spirits who rule the elements and multiple worlds.I had some issues with some scenes later in the book. There is a lot of fighting scenes between Greater Spirits, and some of it I had difficulty picturing. This is not to say that Keith is a poor writer. I found the writing quality excellent throughout the book. But there were times I needed a little more grounding in details. A lot of the fighting takes place in the air, and it became problematic for me trying to picture things. There were also quite a few flashbacks and seeing scenes through other character\'s minds, which confused me now and again.But overall I enjoyed this book. I loved the Japanese flavor to it and the Japanese mythology. Even better, Keith isn\'t afraid to use Japanese words and phrases, which I was happy to say I understood! (I\'ve been taking a little Japanese since my partner is of this heritage.) With a large cast of characters it was inevitable that some were better drawn than others. I liked Keiko and Yui best, which makes sense as they are really the most central characters.

I read a lot of Christian Fiction for that reason alone... Still, sometimes even supposedly Christian writers DO include that stuff. This writer was squeaky clean, and I loved that!!! I will probably read other books by her.I loved her transition in her thoughts about the leading man!

It starts out with Gia and three of her friends in a set-up that is pure cheesiness with their little Girlz club and this guide to life they\'ve written (while it provides the framework for Gia to do what she does, it felt a little too much like a junior high level club among bff\'s...ugh). I\'m telling you right now, ignore that aspect of this book and you will love this book because the romance side of it is so good.Gia has had a crush on one a guy who works at the same company as her. They don\'t work in the same department and he has no clue who she is. She\'s tired of being the one in her group of friends who never has a good sex story...or ANY sex story as the case may be since it\'s been forever since she hooked up. The rumor is that Luke is leaving the company, but he has a corporate meeting in Vegas coming up so she and her girlfriends plot to put her in his path that weekend. Gia truly just wants a super-hot sex and fantasy filled weekend with her fantasy guy, knowing that he\'s about to move away. Donning a complete new style featuring colored contacts, extensions, hair dye and makeup and clothes that she normally never wears (by day, this girl is a computer geek), she heads out to Vegas to seduce. It works...too well.This book is so hot and so sexy...and in the end, the romance is so sweet. I fell in love! Here\'s just a tiny snippet so you can see how sexy this book is:Luke\'s temperature spiked.Horny as hell.\"Actually, my fantasy is of a sexual nature,\" she told him, a flash of nerves in her big brown eyes before her gaze locked on his mouth.The nerves, as much as the fact that her stare was like a caress over his lips, were a major turn-on.\"You don\'t say. Is this a fantasy you\'d like to share?\"\"Maybe. With the right guy.\"\"What\'s it take to qualify?\" Whatever it was, he\'d do it.\"Imagination, boldness and the ability to follow directions top the list,\" she said. Then, as if testing the strength of the passion between them, she shifted closer so her full breasts brushed his chest. \"What do you think? Are you up for the job?\"His body hitting a flame hotter than he\'d ever felt with clothes on, Luke grinned at the woman in his arms.\"Babe, I\'m all yours,\" he promised.And it just gets hotter from there. This book was everything good in the smexy department. But like I said, the romance part of it really works too...just because neither one of these characters expect or want anything more. The second half of the book (when they aren\'t having wild sex) was riveting and made for such a good story.I highly recommend this one. This was my first book that I\'ve read by Tawny Weber. I can guarantee you that it won\'t be my last.I received a complimentary copy of this book in return for an honest review.','A rating...'),(712,'2014-05-01 00:00:00','B00CJS3USU',2,'A3ETNNDNQI396S','This is a good, but poorly developed, idea for a story.

That being said the reason I only gave it three stars is that the entire series is in desperate need of an editor.  In one scene dealing with a character named Mr. Blake.  Mr. Blake was referred to as Mr. Sharpe for two paragraphs, before going back to being called Mr. Blake again.  A character was referred to as someones Discipline, instead of Disciple.  There were a few issues with the words &#34;To&#34; and &#34;Too&#34;.  One character with a boyfriend named Carl, once referred to him as Carol.

Her story about a successful romance author getting up close and personal with the handsome male lead of her best-selling novel\'s film adaptation is a quick, charming read with a Happily Ever After - Hollywood style.A spark of chemistry ignites between a spunky heroine and a sexy Alpha male, leading to an inevitable tangle between the sheets. In her quest to school actor Mick Blackwell on convincingly portraying a man in love, author Piper James didn\'t expect to find herself in a clash of wits with the charismatic womanizer. From the moment they meet on the set of Reagan\'s Gift, their attraction is instant, and it becomes a question of when, not if, they would give in to their mutual desires.Playing the Part is the second Brazen book set in Hollywood (the first being Cindy Dee\'s Femme Fatale), although I do feel it\'s the more successful of the two, with its perfect blend of reality and fantasy. The glamorous side of the film industry is pitted against the clinical aspects of the business as well as the drawbacks of living in the spotlight. The movie buff in me loved delving into the behind-the-scenes drama, gaining insight into the scandalous lives of the rich and famous.At its core, Playing the Part is a sweet romance involving two emotionally damaged individuals, hesitant to bare themselves to each other after having been burned in past relationships. Whether engaging in light-hearted flirtation or emotional displays of vulnerability, Piper and Mick are captivating characters. Their connection drives the narrative, enhanced by a handful of strategically placed love scenes with off-the-charts levels of steaminess.As protagonists, Mick and Piper are likable and entertaining. Romance lovers will envy Piper for her fantasy-come-true tryst with a smooth-talking biracial heartthrob (think Jesse Williams from Grey\'s Anatomy). The bookworm and film junkie in me were doubly delighted while reading Playing the Part and I\'m excited to see what Robin Covington does next with her Playing Around series.','Brazen tackles Hollywood again - this time successfully.'),(725,'2013-12-01 00:00:00','B00CNWK5CG',4,'AE4H1E8A90ZHT','Daniel and Sofia, two different characters but meant for one another.

And it&#8217;s his story, a story that he will tell you he was called to bear.Darrell is a writer. Like most writers today, he did what every publisher on the planet will tell you to do &#8211; and that is to build a platform. What publishers mean by that is having enough people who follow you on social media, read you blog, and engage with you that they will buy your book and recommend it to others. Publishers want the assurance that your book will sell, and you have to build a platform to demonstrate thatMillions of writers are out there, dutifully building their platforms. They do everything they&#8217;re supposed to do &#8211; follow people on Twitter and retweet the important ones, find the cool people on Facebook, and watch their blog statistics like a hawk.Vesterfelt was one of them, until he unblogged. Having built a successful blog (and platform), he unblogged &#8211; pulled the plug and walked away.His reason was simple. He felt himself in danger of losing himself for the sake of his platform.He describes what he did and why in a short book (or long essay) with the title of &#34;Unblogger: Discovering the Power of Story in a &#8216;How-To&#8217; World.&#34;What he did, and why, and what happened, is the story he tells. He discovered that an unblogger is first and foremost a person, a human being. The unblogger writes from experience, sharing good stories with people. And an unblogger &#8220;lives a story worth telling,&#8230;a life of meaning, and then just happens to write about it.&#8221;And goes on and says &#8220;we&#8217;re called to bear a story, our story.&#8221; And we are a character, perhaps the main character in the story. And that&#8217;s the story we bear, and the story we write.This idea of story and character is a post-modern one. An individual like me who is, on an average day, decidedly modernist has to consider the ideas of story and character carefully, that is, consider the idea that he or she is a character in a story. It works if you write the story you live. That doesn&#8217;t mean everything you write is demonstrably autobiographical, but is does mean you write from your experience.I liked this little book (or long essay). Vesterfelt has much to say.

And the main male character, he is a strong alpha type but yet he too was a little tame.  I didn\'t really care for these things.  There is one point in the story where Logan describes how his mate is everything to him and she means everything to him.  But in the same breath he was short with her about a misunderstanding.  (Don\'t want to give to much away.)  I would think that if the person is your \"true mate\" you would ask questions first.  There were just a few little areas that didn\'t fit the story being told.

OK, I will bite.I love Science Fiction - Alien stories. The fact that you included members of the LGBT community guaranteed that I would pick it up to sample.Kudos for including the LGBT members within your cast of characters.The alien invaders and their method of conquering earth (leaving humans to kill themselves off first) was good as it showed the darker side of mankind.Most all apocalypse stories come equipped with the authors political and personal world views of the woes of society. Yet, I thought you got a bit heavy on that. Commentaries on society are best when they are implied or spoken in passing, leaving the reader the option to buy what you are selling or not. If the author (through the MC narration) hammers too hard on their own personal spin, it takes away from the characters and the action of the plot (story).This reader got caught up in wanting to knock the main character on the head for his inconsistencies and double standards, so much so that I almost stopped reading altogether.  And so it took me 3 days to finish what should have taken me one, because I kept grumbling at his \"logic\".  In short: dial it back buddy.Next, This again goes to me as a reader, I can not get into a story if the characters in the story are inconsistent, stereotypical and or  not redeemable (I need to know that they are seeing their flaws and on their way to change). I found no redeemable qualities in several of your characters. Your protagonist is hardly a good guy and your antagonist (the military guys) are whom I would be cheering for. Your heroes are just as savage as your villains, in fact more so because we do not \"know\" the military characters back stories only that the \"farm\" council (who as I have already said have questionable morals) do not like them.  I want a hero, even if it is a flawed hero. I want to see the good vs. bad and your hero and for that matter the entire council hold no hope for saving society. They are self absorbed, morally questionable and frankly most of them are stereotypical, flat characters.So does that mean I hated the story? No. It was an \"OK\" read.I liked the world building that you did.  I thought the aliens and the method of battling them was original.Yet in the end, I do not know that I would pick up another episode in this series as I am not emotionally invested in your cast of characters enough to see what happens.Yet having stated all that, I think that readers of the Science Fiction genre may enjoy this title.','First book of an alien science fiction series.'),(748,'2014-03-02 00:00:00','B00CXFH4MC',4,'A104ZV8AHDTTQP','A reminder as to why I don\'t read much of this type.

What I thought was going to be a cute supernatural-filled read turned into a high-powered, tilt-a-whirl sundae with OH MY toppings.The GoodIt was even better than the first chapter had me so excited for. I met a girl that\'s strong and stubborn working for an investigation agency with her mom. One fabulous thing about this story that I don\'t see often is that her mom is a large part of her life. She tries to set Jessie on the bench during the hard cases to keep her safe, but Jessie\'s too stubborn for that. I love seeing this caring mother though. Jessie\'s father plays the role of absent parent, and his story, even how it\'s revealed in bits, is incredibly interesting.Lukas is by far my favorite character besides Jessie. He is the storm that rolls in and blows their town to smithereens. Handsome, charming, a bit naive, and great back-up, he brings the problem to their doorstep, but stays through thick and thin to get the mess cleared up.The story and the writing are absolutely spectacular! I didn\'t want to put this one down for a minute. The whole concept of the Seven Deadly Sins being personified and snatching bodies was unique and exhilarating, then Jessie and her mom having such a small deadline to be up against to save the innocents kept the pace action-packed. There are epic twists, turns, and reveals within the pages of Darker Days.The BadNone - yep that\'s right. I don\'t remember one negative thing with this book. Even the cover is pretty!The RomanceThe romance is very YA and cute to read. Jessie and Lukas make an adorable pair. Lukas is amazingly good, handsome, and old-fashioned. Jessie needs an old-fashioned guy. She\'s a little rough around the edges and he helps smooth them out. I like seeing the two of them together.There is an attempted rape to watch out for.ConclusionWow! Talk about an ending! How could you do that to me Accardo? Smack me with the feels and make me get all invested and emotional? What a roller-coaster ride and cliff jump at the same time, but in a good way! This story should thrill any paranormal and urban fantasy fan. Jessie may be a YA character, but there is not a lot of the YA annoyances that may turn adult readers off. Darker Days has some great supernaturals, action galore, topsy-turvy twists, and a story-line that I must see continued in a second installment!

Though hardened by embracing what he is after Sera left Cole knows she is the only woman for him and is willing to do anything to keep her this time.With outside forces doing all that they can to return Sera to Heaven can Cole keep her with him and safe? What are they both willing to sacrifice to be together?I really enjoyed this story&#8230;though I wish it had been longer because I devoured it in about 2 hours&#8230;and can\'t wait to dive into the continuation of Cole and Sera\'s story in My Demon Determined. I loved Sera and her stubborn and sometimes childish ways. She is strong-willed, curious, and refreshing. Cole&#8230;*swoon*&#8230; passionate, dominating, and frustrating as hell sometimes!

Who knew a love story between an oracle and a demon could be so HOT? As I began My Decadent Demon, I wasn&#8217;t quite sure what to expect. However, after reading the first few paragraphs, I was hooked.Seraphina, Sera, is an oracle in training who has the gift of foresight, and one of the first visions she sees is a sexy as sin demon, Cole. However, she doesn&#8217;t know he is a demon; she just knows that his destiny is linked to hers. She sets off to find him in the human world, and he is even more spectacular in person. When the two meet, they begin a sexy, torrid affair until she realizes what he truly is. Of course, her being an angel and him being a demon would never work in her eyes, so she leaves him. Fast forward 100 years later, and she hasn&#8217;t been able to forget him. Meanwhile, he has been living half a life without his angel. She hunts him down again, and they pick up where they left off with Sera professing her love for him. Of course, fate intervenes, and they have some major obstacles to overcome. Will they be able to overcome their two very different backgrounds to find their own HEA?This book has to be one of the most sensual reads I have read.

It was like soft, warm velvet rubbing across her skin.&#8221;&#8220;Her lids slid closed as she inhaled his scent. Oh Heavens, he smelled raw and wild and intoxicating. Like thunderstorms and forest fires and the finest ambrosia.&#8221;And I don&#8217;t think I will ever look at candy and chocolate the same way again after their hot session in the kitchen. WOW!!!!There wasn&#8217;t one thing I disliked about the characters. Sera is one unique angel. There is a sweet innocence to her, but yet she does have this naughty side that Cole is an expert at bringing out. Cole is one hot domineering demon. All he has to do is look at Sera, and she is putty in his hands, and he is excellent with those hands! As readers will see, he may be a demon, but he certainly has a human man&#8217;s heart. They seem to bring out the best in each other, and they are a couple you are really rooting for. You want them to end up together even though they are from two very different worlds and have so much to overcome to find happiness. I will say it again. The sex scenes are UNBELIEVABLY HOT!!!Borrowing one of Sera&#8217;s quotes, &#8220;Sweet stars above,&#8221; this one fantastic, steamy, sensual book. I do have the sequel already on my Kindle.

I had read Parent\'s Forty Days and fell in love with her writing style. I was glad to read Precious Things and see that her style (although vastly different genres) was still apparent throughout.When I first started Precious Things I couldn\'t  help but think that Isabelle was slightly pretentious. However, as I continued I realized she was just a normal 18-year-old girl struggling with a huge let-down and really, a life of let-downs. Where I noticed some readers feeling hostility towards her, I felt empathy and tried to view her situation with an open mind. She continued to grow up and grow on me throughout the story.As for Evan, he was great. I love that he\'s not the prototypical NA male. His normalcy is refreshing. Now don\'t get me wrong, Evan isn\'t perfect, he has his flaws, but nothing too serious. He\'s just a generally nice guy and although he respects Isabelle, he also stands up to her when the times arise.I also really enjoyed the side characters, including Isabelle\'s brother (Corey), dad, and new friend, Lucy. They all brought their own challenges into Isabelle\'s life.  Her dad presents as one of the biggest challenges. After using her college fund to re-mortgage his small (and somewhat failing) bakery, Isabelle is forced to attend community college rather than the prestigious university she had always dreamed of. She feels resentment and anger towards her father but never feels that she can express it. Between her dad\'s frivolity and her absent mother, Isabelle has built a wall around her emotions. Evan helps her to realize that it\'s okay to express all of her emotions. I really loved Lucy. She was silly and funny. She even continued to try to be a friend to Isabelle despite Isabelle\'s original icy demeanor towards her (and everyone else).Precious Things is not your typical NA. There are no huge, potentially damaging secrets. It\'s about two normal people trying to navigate and learn about the world and themselves. I enjoyed that it wasn\'t about trying to uncover any big mystery but rather about Isabelle realizing and altering her perceptions of herself, others, and the world around her.Overall, I would recommend this book to someone looking for a New Adult book with a different twist. In addition, I\'d just recommend this author\'s work, period, because she has a real craft for storytelling.','Unique Twist on NA Contemporary'),(777,'2013-11-29 00:00:00','B00D6XE2GQ',5,'A33YHG38QGS7MI','I have never cried so much in all my life.

I was really hoping that the author would continue this frank portrayal of another college woman trying to navigate her way through some regrettable behaviors. Unfortunately, the book came up a bit short.Robin was your typical college party girl; the girl that&#8217;s always looking for a good time with booze or boys, preferably both. Yeah, she knows that she probably drinks a little too much and that the hookups leave her with a little bit of an empty feeling, but she&#8217;s young and dumb and having fun. All of that changes after getting wasted one night blacking out and waking up in the arms of her best friend&#8217;s boyfriend. Horrified and ashamed of herself, Robin holes up in her apartment where she sinks into a summer long depression. Robin continues to ignore her friends, terrified of anyone finding out her secret. After deciding that she&#8217;ll have to move out of the shared apartment, Robin gives in to her friend Jessica&#8217;s demands for a visit where she meets Jessica&#8217;s boyfriend&#8217;s cousin, Phoenix.Phoenix is scruffy, tattooed, two days out of jail and living on his cousins&#8217; couch. What he has in the world can be counted on one hand: $5, a felony record, a druggie mom and a bad temper. Phoenix knows he can&#8217;t offer Robin anything but all he wants to do is help the sad girl in front of him who loves art as much as he does. They embark on a friendship, despite Jess & his cousin&#8217;s disapproval. Robin isn&#8217;t sure what she wants out of life, but she admits that she can&#8217;t do it with alcohol. Phoenix becomes her sounding board and it helps that he&#8217;s totally clean too. Of course, they&#8217;re totally bad for each other, but they fall in love anyway.At first, I sympathized very much with Robin. I was a bit of a wild child in college and definitely made questionable choices. I also owned up to every one of my decisions, however much under the influence they were. So I had an issue when Robin doesn&#8217;t run and tell Kylie that her boyfriend is a scumbag who&#8217;s been trying to continue to hook up with her. Instead, she holds her secret close and only cops to it when confronted.Phoenix was really a sweet guy for being &#8220;the bad boy.&#8221; It was just life&#8217;s circumstances that led him down a dangerous path. The self-loathing of being a no good nick was ever present but only as much to be mildly annoying. In the end, I ended up relating more to his character because it felt more genuine.On one hand, I liked their relationship. Phoenix was a good foil for Robin&#8217;s nave suburban girl. He was appreciative and respectful of Robin from the get-go, so she was free to finally be who she was and not have to put on a mask. On the other hand, the insta-love was soo &#8220;insta&#8221; it gave me whiplash. They go to the park, meet for lunch, and exchange a bunch of text and then its love? Right after that there&#8217;s Phoenix getting her face tattooed on him &#8211; for a chick you&#8217;ve known for a month or two?Finally, the other two issues I had was the side story with Phoenix&#8217;s cellmate and Robin&#8217;s reaction after her cover is blown. The former felt contrived and served little purpose to the story. The latter was a ridiculous histrionic response that turned me off of the character completely. Then, in a matter of few pages, the story just whips everything together in a pretty little bow.Even though I struggled a bit with this novel, the writing is fluid and I enjoy the author&#8217;s voice.

Once Amanda finally admits to herself what she feels for him, things get complicated as she has to choose whether to chase her dream or chase what could be the love of her life.Grady Brunswick is an A-list actor who is still trying to get the hang of parenting on his own since losing his wife. He\'s decided to hire Amanda to give his daughters riding lessons as they both love horses. Grady likes what he sees in Amanda and begins to devise a plan to see where their attraction will take them. She resists at first, wanting to keep their relationship professional, but he can tell she feels the same way about him. Grady isn\'t perfect and makes the occasional misstep in his pursuit, but he hopes he can offer her a good enough reason to give him a chance.Thrown is a heartwarming story filled with funny, quirky moments. It centers on a man and a woman finding their way through life\'s craziness and attempting to make a lasting connection through it all.I really enjoyed this story and thought Colette Auclair\'s writing style had a wonderful flow to it. Each scene was set up perfectly and I connected with the characters easily. I may have had moments when I didn\'t want to like Grady...he had a bit of a spoiled actor ego going on, but I couldn\'t stay mad at him. He would always do something to redeem himself! The secondary characters were all well developed, but I admit my favorite was Harris. So. Funny. I think we all deserve to have a close friend as witty and hysterical as he was.It was so much fun to get to know Amanda and Grady. They both had a great sense of humor and were just really good people who were very caring and wanted to do the right thing. I thought it was so interesting how Grady was successful, seemed so together all the time, yet he doubted himself as a father and felt unsure around his mother. It caused him to second guess himself when he normally would be quite decisive. He was overprotective of his daughters, and rightly so, given that he lost his wife tragically. I loved that Amanda was able to tune in to the girls needs and help Grady find a balance between being their father and still enjoying time with them. They made a great team. Amanda had her own demons to fight, which caused some friction between them. I thought the fact that she presented herself as a strong person while she was struggling on the inside was something many of us can relate to.Overall, I think Thrown is a wonderful romance. If you love stories based around personal growth that include a myriad of emotions, and a lot of horse-talk, you would be hard-pressed to not enjoy this one!','4.5 Star Review'),(781,'2013-08-15 00:00:00','B00DB8AVZC',4,'A3M1104X8EN9O','Diamond and the girls are at it again.

I finished Everblue in the wee hours of the night/morning. I just couldn\'t put it down and have already started on book 2 (Evergreen). I like that it\'s told from both Ash & Fin\'s point of views. Brenda has created characters that you can relate to (even those of us that are adults) and a world that makes you wish you could be a part of.EvergreenA good second installment of the story with twist and turns that keep you reading. Like the first book I liked that it was told from both Ash and Fin\'s POVs. Looking forward to reading Everlost!EverlostAs much as I enjoyed this series I was a bit annoyed/dissapointed with this book, the 3rd in the series. Rather than picking up where the second book leaves off it starts in the second book where Tatchi is left/stays in Natatoria and goes through the events that were happening in Natatoria with Tatchi while the second book was happeing on land with Ash, Fin, and the others. Although I liked finding out what had been going on with Tatchi in Natatoria I don\'t see why it couldn\'t have been given to us at the same time. For example, have the Ash & fin POVs and then a chapter in Natatoria so that you knew what was going on in both places in &#34;real&#34; time so you weren\'t then back tracking. And then the third book could have started where the second left off. Also, allowing for giving us more about what happens with the main characters Ash & Fin that we grew to love and followed so closing in books 1 & 2. It was frustrating that they didn\'t reappear until near the end of book 3 when they were the main focus of the other 2 books.I was also a bit dissapointed with how quickly everything was wrapped up. By the time we catch up with where the second book left off and we\'re rejoined with Ash and Fin there wasn\'t much left in the book. While reading I kep thinking how is the author ever going to have enough time to wrap this all up and sure enough I was left wanting more, thinking &#34;Is that really it?&#34; I wanted more both with how things are &#34;fixed&#34; in Natatoria and how things play out for the main characters (not just Ash & Fin but the others too - I don\'t want say more than that so I don\'t give away any spoilers).Don\'t get me wrong this book is still a decent read and I enjoyed parts of it. I just think there should be more and/or could have been done a little differently. If Brenda were to ever add to this series or have a spin-off series I would definitely read it. I still want to know what else happened...','Mer Tales'),(784,'2013-10-31 00:00:00','B00DCZTLOQ',4,'A3UJHS0M6LODOO','This series is good it ties all 3 books together ...full of action suspense and love.

Elodie Parkes definitely knows how to turn up the heat.The Winter Girl begins when you are introduced to Lily.  Lily is moving into a house she has just inherited because she needs to get away from her former life and more importantly her former boyfriend.  She decides that this is the perfect way to move on.  Lily isn\'t looking for anything serious after all she has just gone through, but she hasn\'t totally written off all of them.This is where we meet Ash.  Ash is the typical playboy with a small twist.  Ash is picky when he comes to women and only keeps them for a short amount of time. He always has a summer girl and a winter girl (as he calls it).  But once they fall in love he sends them on their way. Well once Ash meets Lily he thinks he found his winter girl and that\'s all.  Or is it.........This is where the story between these two begins.  I don\'t want to give too much away because it\'s definitely something you need to read to get the full effect.I\'m not sure this romance book is for everyone.  It isn\'t the classic guy meets girl and they live happily ever after.  You ARE NOT going to love Ash in the beginning. This doesn\'t happen till towards the end. So when you are reading it\'s hard to get into the story and route for them to be together.  But in the end it was worth the read even though it\'s not a classic romance story.  It is crazy hott between these two character though.  So if you are looking for some heat.  This book will do it for you!!I give this story 3  stars.

It has it all - loads of hot men in a heated environment with leather, ropes, whips, sex toys, bondage - and gorgeous characters who obviously madly desire each other! There are complexities due to inability to express feelings and past lovers on the scene to cause some dramas.The characters are wonderful. Firstly Chase (I always love a character named Chase!) who wants Derek to submit to him but needs closure on his relationship with his past submissive first. And Derek, who finds he can\'t get Chase out of his mind.I loved the way the characters were able to have sexual encounters with other people so long as the other was involved, even if the other was only observing. This seemed to really fit the plot and characters, rather than a forced scenario where they suddenly became monogamous to show their love. And this really seemed to fit with what Derek was looking for in a master, someone he\'d be prepared to be collared for. \"I just can\'t find the Master Right who knows damn well that when he lets me off the leash, I\'ll come back, but who will still clip me to it enough to make me feel like I\'m still his, you know?\"Great story with an interesting plot and emotional element balanced with some very, hot and well written scenes of dominance and submission.Now I just need to find out where the nearest and next Leather Convention is being held and make plans to attend......','Great story, great characters with emotional element and hot sex!'),(791,'2013-07-19 00:00:00','B00DG9L4B6',5,'A24H5TP8HNEKQZ','What a wonderful story.

It was filled with so many different emotions.  It will make you cry, laugh, and just make you so desperate to keep reading to follow Grey and Dawson along on their journey.  This was such an incredible romance!  The chemistry between Grey and Dawson is amazing!  It was such an enjoyable story and Jasinda Wilder did a fantastic job with this novel!Grey Amundsen is the pastor\'s daughter from Macon, Georgia. She\'s an untouched virgin and has always lived by her father\'s rules her entire life.  She uses dance to channel all her inner thoughts and feelings. Her father allows her this one thing, as long as her outfits aren\'t too sexy and her dancing isn\'t dirty.  One day, Grey decides she\'s had enough. Escaping to Los Angeles to pursue an education and career in the film industry, Grey finds herself struggling to pay her way through college. That\'s what leads her to taking a job as a stripper.  If she thinks her life has been changed already, when Dawson Kellor steps foot into her club and requests a dance from her, things just completely turn Grey\'s world upside down.Dawson Kellor is the hottest actor in Hollywood.  He\'s rich, he\'s a playboy and he\'s People Magazine\'s Sexiest Man alive.  He can have any woman he wants, but he wants Grey.  Dawson saw something in her. He saw fear, but he knew she didn\'t belong there. This girl was different and he had to know her.I really liked Grey.  She\'s sweet, beautiful, strong and smart.  I felt for her when she had to deal with her father.  He didn\'t want her to do anything but be a pastor\'s daughter, and he kept her sheltered.  Then, she finally stood up to him and left to follow her dreams of working in the film industry.  I was so incredibly proud of her.  Of course, family is important, but her father needed to realize that she was old enough to make her own decisions and choices.  She was such a strong person, working as a stripper even though she hated it, but she did it because she wanted to make something of herself.  I admire her for that.\"My name is Grey Amundsen. But Grey, she doesn\'t exist in here, in this slimy, smoky, sex-hazed hole. In here, I\'m Gracie.\"I completely loved Dawson!  I loved everything about him.  The minute he sees Grey, his life completely changes.  He\'s so used to being a playboy and sleeping with different girls every night, but he wants to change because he sees something in Grey and he knows that she\'s different.\"You make me feel alive, Grey. And... I love that feeling.\"The sexual tension and attraction between Grey and Dawson is sizzling!  Their connection to each other is so intense.\"You know I\'ve put on, like, fifteen pounds of muscle since I met you? Because you get me worked up and then I can\'t get off on my own because if feels wrong, and I need to let it out, so I work out. You turn me on, just breathing.\"I loved this book.  The connection between Grey and Dawson was incredible.  I could not put this book down, I was so addicted to it!  I had to know what was going to happen and I found myself hanging on every word.  There were certain parts of the book that had me laughing, crying and I loved every minute of it.  I can\'t even pick out a favorite chapter or part of this book because they were all amazing.

I agree with that wholeheartedly. The premise behind the character is interesting: a young girl who has visions of the past and future.  But the author takes the situation far beyond that, turning young Grace into a Jesus figure who \"channels the power of the sun\" and uses it to cure injuries and illnesses. Grace isn\'t at all 3-dimensional; she\'s perfection personified, as is her carrot-topped boyfriend, Chance.  We\'re told very little about any of the supporting characters, who are either very, very good, or very, very bad (in nature). The plot has no depth, either.  There\'s a catastrophe in the Silo.  Grace fixes everything.  (Well, almost everything.)

In a situation like that, I believe you owe it to your potential audience to give them the best - and most polished - work that you\'re capable of producing.  If you\'re working on another story, please seek out the help of a beta (an editor) who can help you with the technical aspects of writing, and one who\'s willing to be honest with you, so that your writing can become better and better.  I think you owe that to your audience, and you owe it to yourself.In the meantime, for anyone who\'s not a friend of Hanna\'s and simply wants to share what she\'s written, I\'d recommend giving this story a pass.

Forever love and fun until the morning sun&#8230; Forever together&#8230; Forever&#8221; ~ Initial DWe all want our first love to last forever, yet, realistically, we know it probably won\'t. Circumstances change; people change; and life goes on. For Robbie of \'Forever Young\' by Jeff Erno, his first love, Cole, brings along with it many firsts. Robbie has always worked hard and studied hard, but has no social life. In fact, Robbie is not truly living, he\'s existing, hiding behind his anonymity, with his music being his only outlet. That changes when he meets Cole. His life with Cole is fraught with passion, but also with danger. Unless Cole can restrain himself, it may be over before it has even gotten a good start.When Robbie meets Cole, he\'s amazed that a cool guy like him would pay attention to someone as boring as Robbie. All of his life, Robbie has tried to be as invisible as possible; shy and retiring, people constantly underestimate the person beneath the gentle faade, mistaking Robbie\'s kindness for weakness. Cole\'s interest in him makes Robbie rethink his attitude; he finds the confidence to speak up for himself, causing others to see him in a different light. This newfound self-assurance gives Robbie the push he needs to show his true colors. He impresses Cole with his understanding and loyalty which enables them to stick together through obstacles that would normally tear a couple apart. Cole is everything to Robbie and he will do anything to stay by his side.Cole is overwhelmed when he sees Robbie. He\'s convinced, right away, that this gentle, kind boy is someone he wants to get to know and possibly someone he could love. Cole sees Robbie for so much more than he sees himself and encourages him to be more self-expressive. Cole hates to lie to Robbie, but fears that the truth, that he\'s a one hundred and sixty-seven year old vampire in a seventeen-year-old body, may cause him to run screaming in the opposite direction. When Robbie learns the truth, he\'s certainly surprised, but is so in love with Cole that he immediately searches for a way to justify his fear and still find a way to stay with him. Cole shouldn\'t be afraid though, because he and Robbie are now so intimately bound that nothing can tear them apart.Although this is a Young Adult book, it\'s certainly not a light read. This is a teenage love story with vampires and werewolves, but it\'s quite different than some other vampire love stories I\'ve read. Jeff\'s writing is much better and the story is by no means silly or trite. He takes his subject very seriously. I especially like the way he provides clues by tying his characters together. It\'s a dark, sometimes frightening story about two boys from very different backgrounds, trying to find their way in a hostile environment, while fighting off deadly enemies on all sides. It also addresses the issue of blind prejudice between the various groups involved, i.e., humans, vampires, day walkers, and Matarians, the message being that there are always exceptions and these need to be taken into consideration in any situation.I\'d recommend this book to both young people and adults because, besides being entertaining, there are life lessons to be found hidden within the fantasy of the story.

It takes place in the year 2017 and the unemployment rate is around 50%.  Houses are being abandoned by people who can no longer pay their mortgages.  Companies have closed because they can no longer meet their payrolls.  The offices of Social Security, Medicare, and Unemployment and all public assistance agencies are bankrupt.  Because the government is bankrupt, fire departments and police departments have also shut down.  If a building catches on fire it just burns down.  If a crime is committed no one even bothers to try to call the police but rather citizens have armed themselves and take matters into their own hands in dealing with the criminal.In the midst of this chaotic society, a group of people travel from Nashville to the mountains of North Carolina where they can get away from some of the lawlessness and where they will attempt to live off the land. Of course, they have to defend themselves against some of the local people who decide that robbing them would be a good idea.  They very quickly align themselves with the Cherokee Indians on a local reservation so the Cherokees can teach them about hunting and fishing and growing crops and can also provide some additional \"firepower\" if bad guys attempt to harm them.Now, all this being said, I believe this is the first ebook I have ever returned for a refund.  The writing is terrible!  Some of the words misused by the author are \"and\" for \"an\", \"is\" for \"his\", \"past\" for \"pass\", \"accustom\" for \"a custom\", \"are\" for \"our\" and \"our\" for \"are\", and \"mine\" for \"mind\".  He also somewhat randomly capitalizes words that should not be capitalized.  He makes a word possessive when he intends to make it plural.  (\"We have five truck\'s\" when it should be \"We have five trucks\".)  He has run-on sentences, sentence fragments, and question marks where the sentences are not questions.It is a shame that the writing is so terrible that it distracts from the storyline.  I do not want someone to operate on me if he is not a professional and does not know what he is doing.  Likewise, I don\'t really want to read a book written by someone who is not a professional and does not know what he is doing.

Something about it called to me, even before it was released. Perhaps because the only episode of the TV show \"Hoarders\" I ever watched featured a gay man. Perhaps because an older gay friend of mine slipped into hoarding several years before his death in a convalescent home. He languished for two years in the convalescent home because his own home had become uninhabitable and he was no longer physically or emotionally able to handle cleaning it out and he vehemently refused the help of friends and professionals to make it right again. Perhaps it called to me because I am retired but once made my living as a mental health therapist and, later, a social worker who made home visits and occasionally stumbled into a hoard.Jaspar, the identified hoarder in this novel, is a really likable guy and I must admit that I was grateful his hoarding was of books, newspaper and other paper products and not some of the worse things that can be hoarded to create awful health hazards.  I had to get past my own professional ethics regarding never getting sexually involved with clients to fully enjoy the book but I did let go of making too much of it and just allowed myself to take it at face value. I found myself savoring the book, reading it over several days, rather than bursting through it from start to finish like I do many books of this genre. Perhaps this was because of the memories stored in me of my, now deceased, friend and the various hoards I stumbled into as a home visiting social worker. I found that I  needed  to mentally and emotionally sort some of those memories while reading the book.  I have been in Lewis\' shoes, trying to get someone to clean up their mess and it can be really overwhelming. I really liked that Lewis was self-aware enough to know his own psychological flaws and shortcomings.  If Jasper had transference, then Lewis had counter transference.This book was a very different backdrop to an m/m romance novel than any I have read so far.  I truly enjoyed it and also cleaned out a couple of closets and hauled away all of my, no longer used, professional attire during the reading of this book!  Since I retired two years ago, have gained some weight and have no desire to hang on to things I don\'t really have use for, this book actually spurred me into action.  Thank you, Ms. Myles!  My closets are clean, Jasper\'s house is cleaned and sorted, Lewis has finally found his permanent love and all is right in the world.

Typical of alpha male/dom characters in romances, Jason was rather forward and aggressive and sub-like Lucy was somewhat hesistant to give in to Jason\'s advances, but she gave in to tempation to act on her intense attraction and their office couplings were consensual.  The characters are likeable and I was interested in reading more about the pair, so I read the follow up book, \"Twice Tempted\".  There is more story and romance in that book as well as hot sex scenes that occur outside of the office.After reading \"Tempted\" and \"Twice Tempted\", I read \"The Contract\" which is another of the author\'s workplace romance books.

The characters were interesting but the constant use of 3rd person omniscient POV in talking about the characters was distracting for me. Sometimes the characters would be in 1st person present tense then there would be an abrupt switch to the 3rd person. This abrupt switching also carried over to scene transitions especially some of the action scenes. The story would be comfortably coasting along then bam we would be in an action scene. Then the action scene would be over and whup we would be coasting along with the story plot. Characters are much more real when they describe themselves in 1st person present tense when executing actions. A couple of the action scenes felt they were there for sake of action only. (I think this was mostly due to the lack of a good lead in to the scene.)After the real bad guys were revealed about 3/4 of the way thru the book, the outcome could be guessed.

At only 65 pages this is a short account of Jake\'s story and the events that took place previous to book one that his wife Jesika soon discovered. Now I wasn\'t a fan of Jake during Moving Forward and unfortunately my opinion hasn\'t changed. Although I did get a recount of his tale and discovered his thoughts and feelings and the reasons behind his actions I didn\'t sympathise with him. Of course I didn\'t wish his untimely end but I did wish he made better decisions.The story begins from the moment Jake met Jesika and decided he needed to make her his own. From the outset we find Jake to be determined and will cross anyone that steps in his way, even his family as his cousin, Holden, finds out the hard way. There are some time jumps as the big events in his relationship with Jesika are visited. It is clear to see that Jake did love Jesika dearly, unfortunately Jake was very insecure, even though he portrayed a tough MMA fighter he wasn\'t confident with giving and receiving love as this was something he lacked growing up. I believe this to be the reason he was so possessive over Jesika and he feared she would leave him eventually as he never felt good enough.Jake keeps his promise to Jesika and he vows to leave the fighting world behind after one last fight, little did he know his actions afterwards would signify the beginning of the end. Now here is where my problem with Jake lies and in his letter to Jesika he admits it himself. Yes he made a huge mistake but if he came clean and told Jesika, he may have had a fighting chance with her but instead he lied and buried that lie for years, even going to extreme lengths to hide it. So even though he showed remorse every day for his actions, I wish he had the courage to tell Jesika as she deserved to know. And I will always wonder if he would have came clean on his own but alas we never got the chance to find out.I did like the note aspect of the story and I think the images of note paper was really good, it added authenticity to Jake\'s plea. I was perhaps expecting another revelation from Jake, as we knew most of the details uncovered in this short book so all we learned was his feelings behind it and the night of the event itself but the consequences remained the same.Erika Ashby\'s writing is easy to get lost in, a lot of time was covered in 65 pages and it was done well. Even though I felt In The End wasn\'t imperative to the story line for me, I would recommend fans of the series to read it if they want to gain a better understanding of Jake and the events that surrounded his life. ~Ava','In The End..

Author Ken Lizzi said via twitter,\"Perhaps the days possess the month; say the 30 days are holding September hostage?\"So I downloaded the novel. In the first chapter, we get a handsome CEO all in a dither over some employee:\"I don\'t know what it is about you, Abby, but I can\'t seem to think clearly when I am round you. All my control just...just disappears.\"Wow.Sounds like all kinds of executive types. Not.Then there was this:\"Don\'t judge a book by its cover. People tend to make decisions about me before I even open my mouth,\" I bark, embarrassment making me appear harsher than I intended to sound.  \"Sorry,\" Taylor mutters.She barks!Okay, the author could stand to join an online fiction workshop (many are free, and a good way to learn the hallmarks of professional vs novice writing). I\'m opposed to the 1- and 2-star bandits who download free novels and trash them. This story is fast paced and full of the features that sell well today. It reminds me in many ways of the opening of 50 Shades of Gray -- young, rich boss, employee who thinks she\'s merely average in looks, and instant chemistry between the two. For me, the novel is formulaic, though the big event near the end caught me by surprise. Not for a minute do I believe the one man would allow the other man to coerce him into such a horrible decision, but the woman\'s response, unfortunately, is believable. Authors don\'t usually go that far out on a limb, torturing their protagonists.

I loved this book because it was so good and funny as hell. Sara went into work one night as a nurse working the night shift and this one night shift completely changed her life. She ends up meeting Trenton Merrick and in just one meeting the sparks go off between them. Their relationship is a whirlwind relationship. I mean it takes off fast. Sara\'s two friends are hilarious. The advice they give her is exactly what we girls do when we are mad at a guy. Trenton is very mysterious and Sara can\'t figure him out. Is he a good guy or a bad guy? She doesn\'t know but what she does know is that she is very attracted to him. Trenton is a little like Christian Grey but only with the Alpha Male. Sara is not one that takes orders easily, and it\'s funny how she reacts to the things he does to keep her safe. This book definitely has romance, mystery, suspense, and comedy.

But, it is not a clone, or a homage, or one of those lame books \"in the tradition of ...\". It is much more subtle and clever than that. It takes the whole Harry Potter style and plot and story and plays out elegant, humorous, and sly variations on the Harry Potter conventions. As a consequence it is entertaining and rewarding on its own, and also amusing in its various nods to Potter.The brilliant conceit behind the book is that our hero, Hayden, is not the boy who defeated Voldemort. Our hero, discovered and identified only after the destruction of Voldemort, (in this book known as \"The Dark Prism\"), is the Dark Prism\'s previously unknown and unacknowledged son. Hayden didn\'t know who his father was. Dark Prism didn\'t know he had a son. So, we have an orphan, with an evil bloodline behind him, totally unaware of his magic wielding ancestors, totally unaware of magical practices, who now must be dealt with. Is he a bad seed, to be imprisoned and forgotten? Some think so. Should he be given a fair chance, as the child should not suffer for the sins of the father? Others think so. What to do? Well, he is sent to Hogwarts/Mizzenwald, his father\'s old school and the finest school of magic in the Kingdom. Some will support him; some will oppose him. He must determine for himself who he is and which way he will turn. How is that for a satisfying anti-Potter and a fascinating twist on the Potter themes?Everyone has a reaction when they meet Hayden and learn who he is. Not the positive \"boy who lived\" reaction, but a negative and fearful reaction. Classmates line up one way or the other, as do teachers. Luckily, Hayden develops a few friendships at school and becomes part of a smart, independent posse of free thinking and spirited fellow students. These sidekicks have great appeal on their own and are not modeled after any Potter characters, so they provide some novelty and freshness whenever they are onstage. By the same token there is a lot of detail regarding the magical community, the use of magic, the role of familiars, the operation of the school, and so on, that bears no relation to the Potter books and that stands alone as imaginative and immersive background.That said, while there is world building here, including an entire magical community, and a different magic system, and some back story, and some sub plots, this is a lighter and more nimble book than the Potter tomes. The plot moves along more quickly, the characters are sketched in more briefly, the background is provided on a need to know basis, and the sub plots and red herrings are kept to a minimum. This feels like a book for a younger reader, lacking the depth or the multi book, complex story arcs found in the Potter series. Also, while it is well written, it is written in a simpler and more direct style, where descriptions are breezier and dialogue is more casual and modern, (e.g. something might be \"superfreakingawesome\" in this book).So, I would urge you not to be put off by the inevitable Potter comparisons. This book stands on its own quite nicely, even while it manages to benefit from the Potter phenomenon\'s loosening up and expanding of the middle grade fiction world.Please note that I found this book while browsing Amazon Kindle freebies.

I\'d been reading away for what seemed forever and glanced down to see that I was only 48% done and felt overwhelmed that I wasn\'t even half-way done.To be perfectly honest, the preview gave me a fairly good idea of what I was in for and I should have trusted my judgment more. But I was persuaded by the preponderance of good reviews from people who share my love for P&P; sequels and I assumed that, if they found redeeming value, I would too. Unfortunately, this was not the case.Instead I found many reasons to be frustrated and, occasionally, even irritated. First and foremost, there is very little similarity between Eli and Fitz and Elizabeth and Darcy. Everything is wrong: the way they act, the way they think, the things they do. Secondly, the whole premise is ridiculous. It\'s not only ridiculous for a P&P; variation, or for a 19th century romance novel--it would still be ridiculous for a 21st century romance. I didn\'t find it humorous, I found it embarrassing to read. Was I really expected to believe or enjoy this nonsense?Is there any redeeming quality to the book? Well, its editing is somewhat better than what has become usual lately. The author at least sticks to the premise from beginning to end. The fact that it\'s a silly premise aside, she\'s consistent. It\'s original. This may not be a virtue in the sense that it\'s good, but it is a novel thought (which hopefully will not be picked up by anyone else!)But the third reason that I did not enjoy the book is that I\'m angry at myself for overruling my instinct after reading the preview and actually spending time and money (too much of both!) on something that I should have known that I would not like.My advice: read the preview, imagine pages and pages of the same, and decide if you can take it.','Just doesn\'t work.'),(870,'2013-10-10 00:00:00','B00EJXIO7U',4,'A254TUPHP1P9UV','The premise has intrigue but the characters involved in murder are not as realistically evil as one would expect.

Book one although a drag was actually okay at the beginning because we still saw Drake as mysterious.  I disliked Elaine from early on because she seemed too juvenile for her age.  She\'s said to be about 26 yet she was so undecided about a lot of things and it seemed her so called feud and disappointment with her dad was just in her mind.  She also did not seem to know her own mind about what she wanted to explore sexually and kept running to the lady friend who trained Drake in his so called BD part of BDSM! She also had a friend whom she could not either cut off or take a stand against!  Just juvenile! The book was not really clich&eacute;d it was just badly written I think.I did not connect with any of the characters because for some reason there were a lot of words used to describe mundane things going on but not really much depth to the characters. The author\'s narrative got worse in book two that it was a sheer torture to read up to 50% of the book.Narratives like &#34;drake brought two champagne glasses for us to celebrate, stoked the fire and picked up the glasses he placed on a table by the side of the chair, and he poured two fingers, lifted his glass and toasted to us and I lifted my glass and toasted to us and we sipped as we stared at each other&#34; .... or &#34; i heard two pings on my phone and i opened my phone flap and saw a message icon at the top left corner of my phone screen and i pressed the button and the text opened and i saw i had a message from Drake&#34;.....OH MY GOD! that\'s the dialogue of Elaine\'s thoughts.  It was like that the entire book that I wanted to strangle the author for writing like that.  Who even thinks like that, it\'s either there is a reason why such mundane things are mentioned or skip them and get to the gist of the scene with less words.  It was horrible!It was an awful book in the end.  I couldn\'t even bring myself to finish it!  I was so disconnected from the entire character from skippping the long winded narratives that I skipped the scenes with ex-wife, the son, ex-wife\'s husband and all other useless information that did not really add to the story other than to just throw it in there.Also, Elaine was rich yet she denied her riches then abandoned her ideas as soon as she starts dating drake meanwhile she kept wearing the same dress over and over again at the first few formal events she went to - surely between her mega rich dad and boyfriend they could afford to buy her a dress! ARGHHhhhh!!! Just no show of the opulence that the author said both Elaine\'s dad and Drake had!They kept doing the same things over and over again with the exact same narrative which killed me more than anything.In the end, the book is a sad use of the BDSM world and certainly did not explore the BD part of the BDSM that the author said Drake had!  I ended up hating Elaine and barely tolerating Drake!

Its based around characters who are Olympic standard snowboarders, and though I know nothing of this sport it didn\'t affect my enjoyment of the story.At the end of the last book Ash has just been told his parents and younger brother had been in an accident. His parents died and Logan, who\'s just fourteen, is paralysed from the waist down. Ash has given up boarding to look after him, vowing not to do a sport that Logan can no longer enjoy. Logan is a great character and I felt for him. As a wheelchair user myself I know only too well how over protective family can be, and Logan\'s feeling a bit trapped by it all, but can\'t get that through to Ash. Ash feels its all his fault as they were on the way to watch him, so its a spiral of guilt and problems the two are stuck in. Ash\'s friends have been trying to get him to board again in the months since the accident but to no avail. Then along comes Tansy, a tiny slip of a girl who moves something in Ash. She\'s from the make-a-wish foundation, and has a request from a dying child who wants to meet Ash. They don\'t get off well, but by some odd circumstances they end up together on a boarding trip to Chile, with the sick child and his parents and health carer.Ash is really attracted to Tansy and she to him, but what she doesn\'t tell him is she\'s a cancer survivor currently in remission. At nineteen she\'s been in and out of treatment for ten years, so add to her overprotective parents the fact she has none of the usual teen experiences of boyfriends, parties and clubbing. Her sister is great, younger in years but older in experience, she sends Tansy some porn sites to educate her about sex &#8211; that was really funny...I felt for Ash too &#8211; she\'s kept quiet because she didn\'t want to be thought of as Cancer Girl &#8211; where people treat you differently though they don\'t mean to. You lose your sense of self and become someone unreal. Been there, done that, and understood perfectly where Tansy was coming from! I don\'t know if Tracey has experience of herself or someone close with cancer or wheelchair use, but as someone who\'s in both categories ( 19 years past the time I should have died) I feel she\'s done both those parts incredibly well.Of course one moment everything&#8217;s going swimmingly and Ash is snowboarding for  Timmy, the dying child, who is having a great time, and Tansy is enjoying her first romance and sexual encounters, when the bomb drops and it all goes wrong. Again its handled really well, I can imagine and empathise with all of the characters in how they react. Its a great read, hot sex, adventure and a great romance too.Stars: five, one to keep.ARC supplied via Netgalley','fabulous follow up :)'),(907,'2014-06-30 00:00:00','B00F1X368O',5,'A0980592Q6W60Q720SET','All 3 books was excellent.

When he returns to the small town where they grew up he does everything in his power to win her back. Only problem is that she doesn&#8217;t believe he is being honest or if his feelings are from guilt.Abby felt like her life was turned upside down and she was left having to be the one to care for her ailing grandmother and other family members. At one point during the story Abby mentions to her friend that she feels that if she would have gotten married to Braxton her life might have not been the way it turned out. It gave the impression that she also held a bit of resentment against Braxton for running out on her.One thing that I loved about the story was the letters that are at the beginning of each chapter.

A hitman was hired to kill them but thankfully they escaped. Every town they move to Tessa hopes is the last but she knows it wont be. She hates lying so keeps a very low profile.

However, book one in this series The Alpha Claims A Mate, is filled with witty dialog and characters you really do want to get to know.  I recommend book one wholeheartedly, but you do not have to stop and read it first to get 100% from The Alpha Meets His Match.This book introduces  the hero and heroine really quickly.  There are no delays here and it is a good thing; the author sets them up in all kinds of situations to show us their depth of character, why they are perfectly matched as well as why their histories make them who they are.  This books gives you it all for the hero and heroine from dislike, distrust and bad mouthing which amazingly turns into hilarity, camaraderie, respect and eventually love.This book isn\'t all fun and games there is a serious plot that is well developed and I personally feel Georgette St. Claire used humor in all of the right places so that the story didn\'t get too intense.At the end, there are bodies, plot twists, wrongs made right and a great ending.There are no cliff hangers (thank all the book gods.)  For me as a reader, as I closed my kindle I was left with a deep seated need to be assured that the secondary characters would have their own stories in the future.  Why?  Because I really loved every secondary character (OK not the villains, they got what they deserved). I look forward to the continuation of this series and will auto buy every book that Georgette St. Claire writes in the future.In conclusion buy this book!  There are so many things to love about it; but I have to say it was well worth the price just to get to know the character Pixie, she has the best one liners I\'ve read in many many years!

To be honest, I did not love it, but I liked it quite a lot. The first book was very good and I also got attached to the characters, but it was nice finding out more about their friends in this book.I am really glad that the author kept the characters from the previous book and not just presented the story of Karen and Connor. It would have been weird, right? I mean they are friends, they go to the same school. We learnt a few things about Karen in the first book, so it\'s completely normal to have the other characters in this book.The book is well written and the plot as well. I must say that the author writes interesting and unique stories. I really loved the characters. Karen is quite geeky, unexpectedly so. I love that about her. To be honest, I could not imagine living her life. She lives under so much pressure, but in a way I think she enjoys it. She wants to be the best as what she does because otherwise she wouldn\'t continue doing what she does.Connor is the ultimate bad boy. We know right from the beginning that he is exactly what Karen should avoid. Underneath it all, he is a nice guy. He might not be the perfect boyfriend, the man to take home to your mum, but he is what Karen needs in her life. I must say that I adore the fact that he is Irish.

Note that \"SECRETS\" can be read as a standalone.The temperatures may be chilly on the Verbier Ski Slopes but trust me when I say the searing heat of the exploits indoors would melt the snow caps. SECRETS follows Flora, an employee in Chalet Repos, an exclusive resort owned by Scott and Holly whom we met in CONFESSIONS. Leaving her painful past in England behind her, Flora is determined to make a fresh start. On Holly\'s Hen Night Flora is dared to kiss the hottest guy in the bar. Enter Zac! Gorgeous, mysterious and dripping sex appeal, Flora throws caution to the wind and ends up playing a game of Truth or Dare with Zac that not only rocks her night but shakes her to her core.Lorraine Wilson\'s books are never what I expect but in the best possible way. The deceptively clean cut sweet cover hides some seriously steamy antics combined with real emotion that makes you care deeply for the characters despite the brief time you get to spend with them.I adored Flora as an MC. Sweet and kind belying the steely strength within, she made the painful decision to walk away from a toxic relationship despite being hammered for the ensuing consequences. Always putting her dreams to one side she now has the chance to do what she wants and I really sympathised as she struggled to come to terms with the fact that she was now capable and more importantly allowed to make herself happy. Likewise with Zac, it was a pleasant surprise to meet an MC who was confident without the arrogance that always seems to overpower the initial \"meet cute\" in other romance books. He too is struggling with a painful past and the connection he formed with Flora when he realised how his past and hers were linked in the most devastating of ways was  equally heart-warming and heartbreaking.Two souls equally as eager to forget their troubles for one night and instead finding that the healing they crave so desperately can be found in each other was wonderful to witness and I devoured the book in pretty much one sitting. This book is decidedly much hotter than its predecessor and there were many, many blush-worthy and entertaining moments to bring a flush to the cheeks to rival the Alpine air!SECRETS OF A CHALET GIRL is a sweet, satisfying, steamy read with great characters, a depth of emotion unseen in other romance books and very enjoyable!

I\'ve become a huge fan of her Heller Brothers Hockey series and so sad to see it coming to an end with her last book, Offside which is Matt\'s story and my favorite one. I was drawn to Matt and Honey\'s story right from the beginning after learning that there was a past relationship between them that didn\'t end well and their reaction after seeing each other again. I liked that these two characters were flawed, had to grow up and learn from their mistakes and overcome adversity that made them stronger. I adored Matt who was an all-around nice guy and defended Honey when others didn\'t give her a chance. Sure, he had a &#34;gut&#34; reaction at first but once he saw she had changed, he did everything he could to spend time with her and get her to &#34;open&#34; up to him because deep down, he still had feelings for her. He was also not afraid to express his feelings about returning to play hockey after recovering from an injury.Honey had a lot of baggage and a wild past that she had to live down and I felt so bad for her. The author did a great job writing her backstory and making her into a sympathetic and likeable character. You got to see why she acted the way she did when she was younger and how she has matured and deserved to be loved by Matt. I loved these two together, they had great chemistry and sparks flew in and out of the bedroom. They were perfect together and I could not stop reading to see what would happen next especially when an &#34;old&#34; indiscretion came back to haunt them. I loved how outspoken Matt was and how he fought to reassure Honey of his love for her; these scenes just melted my heart and had me swooning.I loved the ending of this story and getting to see the entire Heller clan one last time.

He is by far one of my favorite Book Boyfriends.Scottish and sexy, he even wore a Kilt for his wedding!&#34;Life isn\'t perfect, we aren\'t perfect, but I\'m telling you now, Jocelyn, we\'re indestructible.&#34;Castle Hill read like an extended epilogue for On Dublin Street. We get a glimpse beyond the Happily Ever After to see the proposal, the honeymoon, and maybe the fact that there are always bumps in the road to the Ever After. Some big and some small.I loved that Castle Hill had the trademark sexy banter:&#8220;You&#8217;re my everything. You know that right?&#8221;&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to sweet-talk me to get sex, babe.&#8221;My eyes smiled. &#8220;Well that kind of knowledge could have saved me months of uncomfortable expressions of love.&#8221;Not only banter, it had the hot sex Samantha is great at writing.&#8220;Now walk into the bedroom , lie on your back on the bed, stretch your arms above your head, spread your legs, and prepare to take me. Hard and deep.&#8221;He wouldn\'t have to ask me twice! And let me say...airports, airplanes and showers? All frigging HOT.There is also a great amount of romance in this one.&#8220;You&#8217;ve challenged me since the day I met you. No woman has ever challenged me more. Nor made me laugh harder. There is not a moment that passes where you don&#8217;t make me feel more alive than I ever thought I could, and today you gave me something I thought was lost a long time ago for the both of us. You&#8217;ve given me peace, babe. You&#8217;ve given me everything.&#8221;While you think this should be just a sweet little novella showing the happy ever after, it was a lot more. Believe me, there is ANGST! Joss has finally broken down most of her walls, and you can really see her growth in this book. Braden, however, actually was the one who acted like a jerk. I mean, I understand it a little. His background makes it make sense, but he over-reacted and didn\'t give Joss a minute to talk to him.I liked this added drama, though it made me sad to read, it certainly added more of an engrossing story to what could have been a fluff read.Likes:&#8226;&#34;Best.

While sometimes you feel cheated from a short novella, I felt like there was a lot of story packed into 97 short pages, and I loved every minute of it.

Her hen\'s night which was excellent, the distance Rich is creating between them and his reason and resulting consequences for the distance, the meeting of a new delicious man and unexpected surprises as well.The friendship between Jenny and Megan is one that I think a lot of woman would envy, they are each others constant and they support each other no matter what. Megan\'s boyfriend Mark also appears in the storyagain and every reason I fell for him in book 1 is still apparent in this book.The twist for Rich was something I was completely shocked with and his actions towards Jenny broke my heart, I don\'t think I have ever read a character that changes so completely.But enter Warren James in all his beautiful glory and Jenny\'s story gets VERY interesting. He handles everything thrown at him with such understanding and support for Jenny that you can help but swoon and wish he was yours.I will openly admit that at the end of the book I contacted L.

Oh and I could tell you so much more but I don\'t want to ruin the story!Unlike the last book, I so didn\'t see the ending of this book coming while I was reading it.  We are not left wanting anything when it comes to the smut in this book because it surpassed any expectations that I may have had.With the way that this book ends, we are completely left with a HUGE cliffhanger and I am left wondering what it is that Trixie is going to do in the next book.','4.5 from me!'),(974,'2014-01-05 00:00:00','B00FQ7A5WK',5,'A7AVW6MMYZ8B1','I initially read Rupee Millionaire because no one ever thinks of wanting to be such a thing. However, here author Frank Kusy writes in his own memoir of achieving the dream.The book begins in the throes of India where this man from the UK has come to find himself. Here he becomes a horrible self-proclaimed Buddhist, he eats meat after all, and begins to write travel guides.To become better self supported he begins to sell hippy clothing brought back from India to the markets of London.Here he meets an unlikely and bullish character by the name of Spud. Their partnership is forged when Spud takes over Frank\'s market stall and announces he needs a partner. This begins the dream of becoming rupee millionaires which is actually 20,000 British pounds.Frank\'s  partnership with Spud is ironically long lasting, a \"marriage\" of epic proportions which include, Spud\'s threats to customers, bombings, tax evasion and threats to Frank\'s personal health and well being. It seems almost odd that Frank would continue to forge this relationship as long as he did.This duo will achieve the rupee millionaire dream many times over but in the end at what cost.Along the way, in his many travels to India to buy stock, Frank meets other interesting characters all of whom are in  business of some sort but meet yearly as friends. They become known as the Pushkar Posse.These very people will also shape Frank into the person he will eventually become and help him achieve the one thing he has always wanted, the approval of his Hungarian mother.After years of travel that takes the author through personal loss, danger to self, travels through India, Thailand and other parts of Asia, mental breakdown, love and self-discovery, the author ends the book in a twist that even takes him off guard.-------------------Once I started reading this book, I absolutely could not put it down. Through Frank Kusy\'s travels and words, I learned of an India that makes me want to meet it. I also learned of the things I also do not want to meet.Certain chapters make you want to scream at the author, others make your mouth drop in disbelief and even others make you endeared to the author and some of its characters. All in all you wonder if the tale is really true or if this is just a good story written by a man who knows India and its people well.The fact is, I couldn\'t care less. This book was well written and entertaining. It deserves the 5 stars I am giving it.~Naila MoonDisclosure: I downloaded a free copy of this book to my Kindle.

The author writes in a creative and appealing fashion, portraying realistic racial tension and teenage struggles well, but does not seem to wrap up several details at the end of the story very well. In other words, while the situation between the Alaskan boy and his white teacher appear to be happily resolved after a long tension of bitterness and uncertainty, there are other individuals that the reader never finds out about.

With this many in one maybe just maybe will be sated for a minute when done mind you only for a minute. I do love to read about the dark and dangerous but at times some term them bad boys too. But seriously bad for who? Certainly not the reader and because they are all that we are drawn to them, read them and want more. They really do not compare to the sweethearts out there because these guys in these books sure know how to bring it on and also know how to go after what they want and how to leave their loves satisfied, The who\'s what\'s and where\'s is the adventures we crave and the passion displayed,given and received is why we read these and keep coming back for more. In this one you get way more than expected a thirst so to speak temporarily could be quenched and the variety this offers adds that spice to life.The title says it all-it has something for everyone inside whatever you might be craving. A shifter who is a tracker and a fighter fighting for the ones he loves with so much passion he might not only have a son but a mate also when the hearts are done. Another shifter that has 2 sides to him and on a ranch no less. Interesting terminology in this one also that is intriguing in paranormal genre. Searching for the missing also love of a mate would seem was missing also and just might get found. And for those wanting a little bite with their man there is one who is also a mastyr at who and what he does. Most are unacceptable but being that said sometimes that alone turns out to be the only one who stratifies in a way only that it is actually unusual and is indeed perfect for a mastyr and she has what it takes to quench his thirst. Warriors -love em been around forever and certainly dangerous if you are the one they are after. Usually someone always trying to take them out too. The one who tried at one time is the one who could be defeated because a warrior is the champion who slays the heart. By now you are not in the dark but in the shadows and taken into a realm not often traveled but there is a man in the shadows and does the forbidden loves a woman and years later because of that union is the key to call for death. There steps in a man not one to back down from a challenge and together try and rid the world of the monsters that has come out to play. Last but not certainly least one last tale of a vampire and his club but so hot I understand why it might have been at the end it was so scorching you are left burnt to a crisp and would not be able to able to take anymore reading until recuperated and reshaped. As I said a little taste alot of dangerous and you find out what it truly means with the men who fit the bill of this title. Most definitely men I would love to meet and would keep but alas they are already paired or mated as it is said. When finished it will leave you searching for more to be found by each and every author offered in this set.','Dark And Dangerous-Bring It On'),(983,'2014-04-24 00:00:00','B00FUMPY3Q',5,'A1G57EH7F4TB1','I love a good mystery in my erotica and this book delivers.

This wild woodsman has secrets of his own, and it\'s up to them to unravel the mutual mystery as very sensual feelings flare.Penelope L\'Amoreaux is a talented writer with some serious knack for writing a sexy scene. The hot tension beween alpha Tolik and Clara has a very raw and primal feel that hit the spot.

Not me. I never even thought of getting a book from her POV since she\'s so new to the group. But with my changed opinion of Tyler after the last episode, I wasn\'t too mad that she was this week\'s center of attention.I LOVED getting a better perspective of what life at The Colony was like for her. Because let\'s be real, we only saw a glimpse of it when Reagan and the older Parker boys were there. I knew that The Colony was fishy, but I never really understood why Tyler hated it so much and why she was so determined to leave. Now I totally understand why Tyler hated her life there and why she wanted to leave her father and brother behind. (Her father really is one messed up dude. I see that more clearly now.)In this episode, I had a mixture of feelings about Tyler. Yes, in the last episode I actually started to like her though I wanted not to, and in this episode, my like for her continued. Arg! If I decide to hate a character, then why can\'t you just let me hate that character instead of making them all relatable and likable?! But even though I like Tyler now (Gah, I don\'t like saying that!), I was still frustrated with her sometimes. The sad girl is broken and kinda pathetic. You guys! She has a martyr complex!

I love the way Brewer injects a stream of characters into this storyline, leaving the reader hanging and wondering where the plot train will end. I started this book at 8:00 p.m. and wound up reading it all the way through. It was worth losing a night of sleep over. I highly recommend Duke City Split to anyone who loves a quality mystery.

The third book in the Bears series, we were introduced to Sammy, Slater and Brock before, but this is the first time we really understand what Sammy has gone through. They had her the ups and downs and made plenty of mistakes together. Parts of the story were a little bit over the top but overall I think it&#8217;s an enjoyable paranormal love story.Sammy was a very damaged character at the beginning but she definitely fights her way back to her old self. Some of the way she reacts to situations may be triggers to anyone who&#8217;s been abused. Slater and Brock work really hard to help her heal without walking on eggshells around her.

Beatriz has a problem. She needs to review a sex positions manual the weekend of her sister&#8217;s wedding and the only acceptable available man to help her out is Ben, a former crush from college that rejected her.Fortunately, Ben is not about to look a gift horse in the mouth twice. He (literally) jumps on the chance to finally get down and dirty with the girl that he desperately wanted in college. There is no awkward tension as both main characters are very honest and comfortable with themselves and their sexuality.The sex is not so much sensual as it is real. Beatriz and Ben talk about the positions, ask each other about comfort levels, in other words, communicate. As they work their way through the manual, it becomes apparent to both Ben and Beatriz that the feelings they had for each other long ago never really went away. The cast of side characters only add to the story&#8217;s quirky charm.Their banter is amusing and entertaining, in typical Reisz fashion. The characters have brains and wit! It&#8217;s really refreshing to read something that doesn&#8217;t take sex so seriously, but rather reminds readers that sex can be just fun!

We\'re then supposed to believe that this is the real Marcus, all his previous hook ups were simply a coping mecchanism for being abused.

Evidently her previous psychologist never diagnosed PTSD (first thing ridiculous to me). The counselor tells her that she needs to accept what appened to her, and suddenly it seems like magic and she is all cured! Come on....

These are two broken people that come together in journey of self-discovery and love. I like that neither is perfect- each have baggage - and both are kind of eccentric. I know a reviewer said that s/he didn&#8217;t like the first person style (which is not reason to give a 1 star review, just dont read it...ugh?) but although it has never been my favorite it totally worked here. The author is really careful with it so it isn&#8217;t distracting at all. Furthermore, I think it gave more of a connection to the Hero because she truly read him,  she let us know about his changes as seen through her eyes which it makes it sweeter. It just fit the story perfectly. The sex was hot but didn&#8217;t take over the storyline. I gave 4 stars because there was a point before the end that it dragged and distracted me a little.

Stop reading if you have not read Poe&#8217;s book**POE!!!!  Do I really need to say anything else?Fetched is a super-super-sweet novella that is a part of Zoe Dawson&#8217;s Going to the Dogs series and is a brilliant companion to a series I absolutely adore.  Here&#8217;s the skinny on Fetched: at the end of Hounded (Poe&#8217;s book) Poe was all kinds of blissfully engaged to the &uuml;ber-hot Jared and set to start her career as a veterinarian.  As Fetched opens, the bliss is continuing to roll on in as we discover Poe is not only engaged but also pregnant!  Sheesh!!  Hot guy, the Terrible Two, Daisy, a baby and now, to make everything all legitimate, a quick wedding in Vegas hosted by Harper.  To say Poe has been handed a plate full of awesome doesn&#8217;t even come close so why is she so crappin&#8217; stressed out and unsure of where her seemingly perfect life is headed?Although the teensiest bit unsure of what the future holds, Poe boards the plane to Vegas and greets the dog park girls with open arms and a big smile.  True to form, Harper (aka the blonde juggernaut!) has taken care of nearly everything and what she couldn&#8217;t deal with, the ever-resourceful Brooke has covered.  All Poe has to do is enjoy her time in a monster suite, shag her fantastic fianc&eacute; and walk down the aisle when the time is right.  If only she could shake those nagging feelings she keeps pushing aside.The Bottom Line: Fetched is Poe at her finest and I am soooo glad Zoe Dawson added this novella to the Dogs series!!  Fetched is in no way about answering any unanswered questions from Hounded (there weren&#8217;t any!) but about furthering Poe and Jared&#8217;s story and giving fans of the series a wonderful treat that is the Vegas wedding.  Dear Lord, the scene with Daisy at the wedding is hysterical and completely unexpected in the best way possible.  If you have read and loved this series as I have then Fetched will only increase your love and leave you wondering as it has me, if Dawson is going to give us three more companion novellas &#61514;','SPOILERS INCLUDED IN THIS REVIEW'),(1046,'2014-01-03 00:00:00','B00GQ0OF8G',5,'AC1NUNBGFRL7X','This collection was a fun read at a great price.

She wanted to make a name for herself as Candice Salinas. But secretly, she had already made a name for herself as the new erotic romance author sensation &#8211; Candy Sloane. Although she was selling books and have garnered a lot of good reviews, not to mention some really great fans &#8211; if the university founds out, she would have to kiss not just her scholarship but her chance of a PhD goodbye. Then there&#8217;s her faculty advisor, Professor Dylan, whom she wanted to impress, but it seems it was a long way to go before she can get her approval.James Walker &#8211; he&#8217;s the uber-hot local barista and, ahem, her student. She knew that student-teacher relation is frowned upon in the university, and she did try to stop whatever feelings she has for him &#8211; nevertheless, the attraction was too strong to ignore. Against her better judgment, she decides to sneak around with him. Indeed, the adrenaline rush brought about by going against the law promotes thrill that one couldn&#8217;t resist - especially when James starts to show in her writing.Candice Salinas is way to prude to be Candy Sloane &#8211; but with her best buddy Mandy, and some hot kisses from James, it didn&#8217;t take a while before Candy Sloane was out of the box. But she had to deal with her dreams, her parents, her adviser and most especially, her future.Yes, erotic romance had conquered the market since Christian Grey blindfolded Anna Steele. But what we don&#8217;t know what kind of battles have these authors fought to get their books published. Some intellectual snobs may consider them as trash, not knowing that these authors have worked hard to write, publish, and have their books promoted.I love this book, not just because James is a hottie, or because Candice has finally found the courage to out Candy. Candice may have had self-esteem issues and paranoia at first, and it have taken a whole lot of motivation from James and Maddy &#8211; but in the end, she had faced her fears, made Professor Dylan sorry for what he did, and came out.Lisa Burstein may not have been an Erotic Romance Novelist, but she had made this amazing novel encouraging new and aspiring authors, who may have once been given a bad criticism, and have their books branded as trash &#8211; what is important is not just the sky-rocketing sales of the books, but the number of readers who have thought of your book great, and who couldn&#8217;t wait for your next book to be out.&#9733;ARC Copy was given in exchange for an honest review.&#9733;','4.5 Stars'),(1048,'2013-12-14 00:00:00','B00GQOI146',5,'A2R36N02V8OQU4','So sad that this book has finally ended.

Well I have been laying low with my own injury that I would like to attribute to football, but alas it was lazer tag. So I keep tracking my healing process to be reading for the NFL season. What better way to heal than to read football romance!When Cassie learns who her father is, she knows it isn&#8217;t going to be an easy road to travel to get to know him. Giving herself one last night of wildness before meeting him, she drags her best friend out on the town for some clubbing. Dancing horribly, but enthusiastically draws the attention of Trey Owens, the quarterback of the Sante Fe Bobcats. Not a lover of publicity or media, Trey disguises himself to have a little fun. Who knew either of them would find each other and hit it off so wildly?While Cassie knows her father is the coach of the Sante Fe Bobcats, she doesn&#8217;t know Trey is the quarterback. Put under some insane rules by her father, she must give up dating while getting to know him. But after a crazy, not nice start to their relationship, she stumbles into Trey again and still doesn&#8217;t know he is the quarterback. Well, she isn&#8217;t a sports fan, being a nerd and all, so I guess I have to forgive her some, but not totally since I am a computer nerd too and also a fan of football. Hello!Trey on his own is trying to stay out of the limelight, but falls hard for Cassie in almost a stalkerish way. When he finds her again, he thinks it&#8217;s fate and won&#8217;t let go. He too doesn&#8217;t know Cassie is the bosses daughter and they blithely go on their way to falling in love while hiding it from coaches and the media.The romance goes over a coarse of time and you see the two fall in love slowly but also in the right manner. They do find out about each other at some point and Trey is always there for Cassie when the family treats her like (sorry) s%$#! But he also keeps the romance secret for his own sanity not wanting to be the headline of the week doing the coaches daughter.Now let me take one time out and deck the stepmother, Tabetha. This is one unclassy female dog and I am sorry to use so many curse words in my review, but she makes Cassie&#8217;s life a living Hell because she feels so threatened, when Cassie does nothing to deserve it besides be a good sister&#8230;she has two half sisters. Tabetha baits her, tricks her, calls her names and in general is one woman who needs to have her ass kicked.The sisters were hilarious and also giving me some agony! At 16 and 14, they are they age where boys matter, clothing matters and their mother denies them both. Not that denying them boys is so bad, but she never lets them have their own personality. Cassie befriends them, keeps their confidences and even bails the older one out of a sticky situation. Overall, Tabetha should have been thrilled they had an older sister like Cassie around.Trey is hunky along with his two cohorts.

Nat and Mac both have a fear of abandonment due to both of them having experienced losing their parents and Nat having also lost her sister.  They connect with one another through their shared understanding of grief.  But the connection doesn\'t stop there as Mac will do anything to protect Nat and keep her safe.  There\'s also the intense longing they have for one another.  Mac\'s crazy and obsessed ex makes her entrance and this kept me turning page after page wondering what she was cooking up next.

She is a writer and has a flare for expressing herself.  She seems to have the perfect kids, a great mother, a great guy that wants to marry her, everything!She writes the book.  There is sex implied but no scenes so just about any age could read and enjoy the book.  I would recommend it.  I just have one question, in the interview with Regis and Kelly they close by calling her by the last name of Chase.  Since she is married and has a baby, shouldn\'t she have been Mrs. Michaels?  Why would she be going by her first marriage last name?  Just wondering.  It was a good story and I enjoyed it.later.....I was told that she went by Chase because that is the name she wrote the book under.  Still seems strange to me to address someone by a pen name rather than their real name but maybe that is the way authors do it.  Just seems strange to me since Chase was her first husband\'s name.','good story'),(1113,'2014-01-16 00:00:00','B00HLPL20O',5,'A38PSJR5DQZN82','I truly reading this book from Mrs. Morris.

I cannot find any words that will do it justice.  Do you know what kind of book I\'m talking about?  It\'s the kind that causes the lump to appear in the back of your throat making it difficult to swallow, the kind of book that makes you get up and pace because you\'re nervous only to sit back down 10 seconds later because you\'re dying to know what happens.  JS Cooper delivers a book filed with drama, love, angst, and all the other emotions that I\'m still reeling from.In the beginning we are introduced to Hudson and Riley where we learn about the things Hudson did to Riley when they were children.  It\'s your typical older boy picking on younger girl behavior.  As the story unfolds we learn that Riley is best friends with Eden who happens to be Hudson\'s younger sister.  Instantly I thought that this was going to be a book where the girl falls in love with the best friend\'s older brother and best friend gets mad type of book.  Needless to say it didn\'t go that exact way.  We follow Hudson and Riley through the years. Hudson enrolls in college and Riley is still in High school.  While Riley has a crush on Hudson he has a girlfriend in college.  Since Riley and Eden are friends, Riley still has contact with Hudson and she finds herself on vacation with Hudson.  On the last day of summer vacation as something beautiful is happening a tragedy occurs.  Who is responsible?  Now Hudson and Riley are left to deal with the aftermath.  Riley enrolls in college and decides to write an article for the college newspaper while Hudson is trying to help his girlfriend\'s mom and the neighbors.  As far would have it, they run into each other again.  Each of them are still holding on to secrets from the past.  Can these two escape the past and be together or will another tragedy end it all?  This book is definitely worth all 5 stars and worth the journey. HAPPY READING!!!

No one at school knows that she&#8217;d had her heart ripped to shreds by her high school sweetheart, who&#8217;d driven them both off the side of the road on a borrowed motorcycle, and then abandoned her. No one knows the real Rachel Mattson&#8212;except one person&#8230;Ever since he helped nurse his sister&#8217;s feisty best friend back to health, pierced bass player Kai Nakos has been head over heels in love. But the supposed bad boy can&#8217;t risk letting Rachel know the truth&#8212;especially now that the two of them are back in their hometown for the summer, together for the first time since the months following that fateful night. Never mind that Rachel&#8217;s ex is back, groveling for her forgiveness.Shaken by her ex&#8217;s return, Rachel finds herself turning to the one guy she knows she can trust. Kai is willing to hide his feelings for her, just to have Rachel touch him again. After all, this is only a temporary fling. Until it becomes something more. But maybe it had been more all along.My ThoughtsFrom the first time I read the book synopsis this one called to me, the intensity and the sheer thought of finding ones self in Rachel&#8217;s circumstances was a strong hook that I wanted to explore to see how things had turned out for her following her recovery.The very deep feelings that both Kai and Rachel have for each other are apparent to everyone but them from the get go, as they allow themselves to explore their combustible attraction to each other those feelings only grow until they become all consuming.A friends to lovers story that is based on mutual need and yet also has a very solid background in mutual affection and caring, a very compellingly honest look at two people who are trying so hard to come to grips with life and finding it a very bumpy road to overcome mistakes made in their past.Not having read the first two previous books in the series that were the stories for Rachel&#8217;s college friends Avery and Ella it still does not feel like I missed out on anything as this was focused on telling about how Rachel overcame her past and the present situation where she and Kai are finally acting on the chemistry between them.The author used dual POV throughout the book which really helped to establish a better connection with both Kai and Rachel&#8217;s characters as well as showing how each of them worked out their confusion internally as they became more involved with each other.Book 3 of series but it never felt like I missed anything as this was all about Rachel and the pages flew as I devoured her passionate tale! I loved the fact that this had a complete resolution even though there are more books to come, the fact that the ending was solid really helped it to stand on it&#8217;s own without relying on reading the rest of the series.[EArc from Netgalley in exchange for honest review]','Friends to Lovers who heal each other.'),(1123,'2014-05-20 00:00:00','B00HQLB72Q',4,'A2MHRBM9MKRNTN','Rachel\'s life was destroyed in an instant three years ago. Her whole life changed and she needed time to recover. Then she made her escape to a new life in college. She lost her boyfriend and left her best friends, Dakota and her brother Kai, and Shane. She met new friends Avery and Ella in college, but she did not share her past pain and tried to be a new person. She kept up a facade as a more outgoing flirt with a penchant for jocks. But now she is home again with her old friends and back to being that girl she was before she left.Kai was there for her during the hardest time in her life and developed feelings for his sister\'s best friend. After they went their separate ways, he tried to forget her, but it was difficult. And now that they are back together for the summer, it is impossible to ignore the feelings he has been carrying around for her. But his life is a mess and he knows he is not good enough. He is rough, tatted, pierced, and loves music. A far cry from the preppy jocks that seem to be her type. And he does not think she feels the same way about him.But as they spend more time together she is remembering how Kai has always been there for her. She begins to start seeing him as more than a friend, but someone she is attracted to that really knows and cares about her. But Rachel is a girl who lost her way. She has put up walls and kept people out. Her personality had undergone changes over the years and she is trying to figure out who she is and where she fits in.It is confusing for both of them navigating between the attraction they are feeling and resolve it with their past friendship. Kai won me over early on. He was so sweet, protective, and had such strong feelings. But he was totally vulnerable, had fears, insecurities, and was afraid to scare her away. He also had a lot of guilt. I loved that in this story, it was the guy who held the torch for years. And she really had no idea how he felt since he had hidden it so well. They both had crutches to help them cope with their issues and the void in their lives.But she has kept secrets from him, her old friends, and new friends. She has to deal with her worlds colliding and coming clean to all involved. She really needs an anchor and to let someone really in. And he needs to find direction for his life. He needs passion and purpose to overcome feeling numb. And their decisions do not only affect themselves but also their whole support system.Their connection was sweet and built on history. I loved how Kai had been there for her in various capacities and really knew how she had changed. Together their sexual tension and chemistry was hot. And his dirty talking was so in contrast to his soft, sweet side. But their communication seemed to be really good in some ways and lacking in others. So they were often confused about the others\' intentions. And their lives and goals were not always compatible.Can they overcome all of the obstacles, open up, and make it more than just a summer secret fling?This is the first book I have read in this series, but I had no trouble reading it as a stand alone. I enjoyed her friends from college, Avery and Ella, even though I have not read their books in this series(but now I want to). And I liked their best friends Shane and Dakota. I would to see their full story in another book. There also seemed to be a little tease with his cousin Nate and a girl named Jessie.I really liked Christina Lee\'s writing style. It flowed well, sucked me in, and kept me enthralled in their story. It was told in both points of view which was very important due to their confusion and hidden feelings. The characters were complex and well developed. The plot line was interesting. Overall it was an engaging story about friendship, love, and finding your own way.

The second book, A Tale of Two Centuries was Alessandra and Austin\'s story and I enjoyed it even more than the first.  We got to see a bit of Lucas and Cat in that book also, but we really get to know Lucas in My Not So Super Sweet Life, and I totally fell in love with him.

I loved it!!Cat just wants to have a normal life, but with her parents both being in Hollywood, her dad\'s upcoming marriage, and a stunt her mom pulls, Cat has some serious issues she has to deal with in this book, and she doesn\'t always handle things in the best manner.  Lucas also has his own problems he is dealing with related to his family and what\'s expect of him.  Lucas is so romantic and totally swoon-worthy, and is also very protective of what\'s his, namely Cat.  He really outdoes himself in the boyfriend department and I would love to just pull him out of the book and keep him for myself.  He truly is a modern day Prince Charming.  We are also introduced to a new character, Ransom, and well.....I hope we get to see more of him.My Not So Super Sweet Life is a wonderful addition to this adorably sweet, fun, and swoony series that YA romance fans will love.

It just didn&#8217;t pull me in as much as book one did with the character being a strong, snarky, and opinionated female.  Maybe that&#8217;s just a preference of mine: strong protagonist leads instead of whiny, oblivious, and completely nave characters.I&#8217;m not saying that the temperament of Lecanora annoyed me.  She didn&#8217;t.  She was just too innocent for my taste is all.  But, I guess that&#8217;s the diversity that Ms. Baxter brings as Rania and Lecanora are polar opposites and bring something new to each plot development.

He is independently wealthy on account of his father abandoning him and his mother 6 years prior--without saying goodbye and while also removing all traces of his existence from their lives--and setting a trashbag filled with half a million pounds on Quentin\'s bed.Quentin is gay and his BFF Bertie is a lesbian. They occasionally co-habitate. They definitely drink to excess. On New Year\'s Quentin is nearly killed by a drunk driver, but he is rescued by a mysterious stranger who pushes him out of the vehicle\'s path. This stranger has brilliant green eyes and shows up again at the hospital at odd times without speaking to Quentin.Bertie and Quentin\'s mother believe he\'s hallucinating the mysterious stranger. After what seems the absolute longest invalid recovery from a broken ankle in the modern medical era, Quentin goes out drinking with Bertie again. And again encounters the stranger. This time they speak.Turns out Tyrin is gay, and a stalker-first class. And, he\'s not quite human. I\'m not going to reveal his powers, but from the title one should guess he\'s Atlantean. He is charged with finding defector Atlanteans and their half-breed children. Turns out Quentin is more than a passing interest--but Tyrin\'s brother is all about revealing Quentin\'s issues to the Atlantean community, thereby banishing Quentin to Atlantis. While this would satisfy Tyrin\'s sexual interest, it would mean cutting Quentin off from his loved ones...forever.The book ends with a cliffhanger where Tyrin\'s brother orchestrates a commotion injuring Bertie...and forcing Quentin to choose between her health and his Earth existence.The book is a bit of a slow starter with information dumping in the outset. It was clear to me the issue with Quentin\'s father from the second he was mentioned. The magic of Atlanteans was interesting--I liked that they all didn\'t have superpowers--or the same powers. Tyrin is an interesting character; I wish he hadn\'t come off so creepy. As for smexytimes, that\'s between them, alas, we get only a couple of smooches and steamy looks with teasing hints about what great times they had.It took me a bit of time to warm up to Quentin--he\'s a bit on the immature side. I liked him and Bertie, they are a fun platonic pair, but the boozing got a bit much. What\'s with all the puking and passing out?

Now with a tropical storm bearing down on the South and flights cancelled Lilly has no choice but to go on a fifteen hour road trip to Vermont for her friend Hayden\'s wedding with Nate. The attraction between the two is undeniable but both try to fight against it. Lilly\'s plan is to torture and give him the worst case of blueballs in his life. Nate\'s plan is to try and keep it in his pants all the while pissing her off.Nate is struggling with survivors remorse from his last tour, and guilt over leaving his ailing mother behind and his little brother to care for her. Lilly struggles against her past of a bad family and always being left behind. Lilly and Nate try to push each other away but when they give into temptation more is on the line than just pride.The Good: The story was pretty damn perfect. Even my cold and perverted heart cracked a little with this one. You\'ll laugh, you\'ll cry and you\'ll get more than a little hot and bothered. The struggles of the characters as they fight against the past to get to something more was truly touching. The heroine is sassy and sexy but still sweet and has such heart.The Bad: Not a god damn single thing. Even the ending was perfect. My heart is not as pervy and stone cold as I thought.Final Note: Totally worth reading. So many romance novel just seem to blend together and follow the same plot line. This novel just adds something more. More heart, more story, more sexy. Although this is the second novel in the Falling for You series you can read it as a stand alone. I still have not read the first, but will definitely be doing so in the near future. This was the first book in a while that I could not stand to put down.Favorite Quotes:&#34;And there was no way she could go to prison. She looked terrible in orange.

And I began reading it and could not put it down. Had to drag myself away to do my work. An almost perfect story. A few months after Liz leaves London and  Gabriel, she is alone and pregnant. Still independent and working towards her degree and still working full time. When she has to see Gabriel to sign the final paperwork, he doesn\'t seem to know her. She is heart broken. He is in pain from the accident and it shows on his face, at least to her. What will happen when work finds out who the father of her baby is? What does Gabriel have up his sleeve for Liz and her baby? Will Gabriel learn to accept her independence or lose her in the end? Will Liz follow Gabriel\'s rules? There are some twists to this one that I was not expecting but loved them all. Yes there is a cliffhanger but the story is well worth the read.

She has a way with words that pulls you into her story and won\'t let you go. For example: &#34;Noc, claimed he was a spoken word artist, but he was actually just a skinny Puerto Rican guy who sold drugs and wrote lyrical rhymes that would cause Dr. Seuss to rise from his grave and slap him.&#34;She also makes me laugh out loud which not enough books do frankly.  I will be eternally grateful to her for sharing the V.I.B test as well as the meaning behind it (if you wanna know read the book). Her characterizations are well thought out, fun, and the protagonists as well as some other characters seemed to leap off the page and announce themselves occasionally as here for a good time. I even loved how she sensually used food throughout the story.So why four stars you ask?Again for me it\'s a matter of opinion and personal likes (oh alright it\'s a personal quirk).  I have a problem with polygamous relationships. I just don\'t get it and not being a prude or being open minded (both of which I am) hasn\'t helped me to change my mind. I\'ve read many books about them and I still feel woefully confused and behind the eight ball on the subject.It was particularly difficult for me in this book cause I liked Jasmine. She seemed like a smart, interesting woman who would not put up with the crap Chase Stone put out (I don\'t care how fine or rich or sexy, or... did I mention he was really rich?).  And as for his other women, I kept wishing for female characters in other books who are tougher than me to come over and put a nice case of whip a$$ on them. They needed it.  Believe me.Alright I\'ll get off my peevish soapbox and get to the important point.  Like many others I read this book because my book club strongly suggested it and it is not only worth the read, I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. I would recommend it as a fun read that will challenge your social mores.

The external link to their proprietary pie crust recipe is included as a convenience, according to one of the authors. Below is the original review.I downloaded the Allergy Friendly Eats: A Collection of The Little Aussie Bakery & Cafe\'s Most Popular Gluten-Free & Allergy Friendly Recipes cookbook by authors Rita Sturzbecher and John Apostolovic and was a bit disappointed to find the authors included external links to their website to get recipes. I do believe if I pay for a cookbook it should contain all the recipes needed to prepare a dish. I should not have to depend on Internet access to complete a recipe. Also, their cookbook lacks an interactive table of contents making it a bit more difficult to find the recipes you would like to prepare.Also, some of the recipes call for proprietary ingredients such as Little Aussie GF Flour.I do like how the authors stated all the recipes are gluten free and are free of the top 10 allergens unless otherwise noted. You will read an index of recipes and there are notations stating if there is a possible allergy ingredient used to prepare the recipe. You will find numerous color photos showing completed recipes.Some of the recipes you will find in their cookbook include:Spinach Quiche with the notation \"Contains dairy.\" This recipe uses Little Aussie GF Flour and includes an external link for the pie crust recipe needed to make the quiche.Mini Chorizo French Toast (You will need to purchase the Little Aussie GF buns to complete the recipe).Creamy Rice PuddingAlmond Tea Cake (Recipe says contains the notation \"Contains eggs and almonds.\" (You will need to purchase the Little Aussie GF flour to complete the recipe).Dairy-Free Garlic \"Butter\"Australian Lamb Pie (You will need to buy and pick up the pie crust from the Little Aussie Bakery or make the pie crust by finding their recipe online using an external link).Ox Blood Chocolate Cake with the notation \"Contains eggs.\" (You will have to purchase the Little Aussie GF flour to complete the recipe. There is a link to the Little Aussie Bakery & Cafe to purchase the flour).As you can see this cookbook reads more like an advert than a true stand alone cookbook. You will need to use the enclosed cookbook links to find the extra recipes or ingredients you need to prepare the recipes.Note: I suffer from potentially life threatening allergies, so I am always on the lookout for good allergy recipes, and cookbooks.

I wasn\'t sure what the author had in mind for this story, boy does it sizzle. It was even hotter than Ominous Love. Although the story starts out with Eloise\'s birth, it jumps halfway through to when she\'s sixteen. The story is romantic, but also funny and there are plenty of laugh out loud moments. It\'s also sad in parts and will bring tears to your eyes. The first book was written from Eloise\'s point of view, but this story is written from the male\'s point of view, which was great. All through this story, the reader will be right inside the MC\'s mind, through his suffering, his learning and his discovery of what human teenage hormones feel like, and the problems they can cause.

So glad I found her books.  Toby is a man who has found his calling & loves his work as the GM of a hotel in Stamford.  When he meets Rain, a Master Carpenter who\'s been hired to build a bar in the hotel sparks instantly fly.  There is a wonderful chemistry between the leading men that just draws you in, I found myself instantly falling in love and cheering for them to make their relationship work.  I don\'t want to give any details away form this great story because I want you to watch it unfold for yourself. While there is drama there is not the angst that is in \'Saving Alexander\' or \'Worth Keeping\' (both also excellent stories) there is plenty of humor with an unlikely phobia and an unexpected talent for pole dancing.

I received a copy of this book in exchange for an unbiased and honest review**Review: 3 starsGeneral: Then There Was You is a good little romance read. For me, it had many strong elements from a strong set of characters to a mostly compelling plot. The cover too, was a good hook into it. I thought the writing itself was high quality and the words easy to read. Salem and Chris were wonderful, well written characters with a story that was both believable and emotional.However for me I just didn\'t click with the book all the way. There was something about it that kept me from having that hard to put down response. I certainly enjoyed it from beginning to end but it wasn\'t engaging enough personally. I think the issue may have been the point of view. Since becoming a book blogger I have learned that there are multiple points of view that can work, however I still prefer the third person when dealing with an emotional and impactful story. This book didn\'t reach out and grab me despite the extremely strong characters. I almost feel it\'s a disservice to people reading this that I can\'t put my finger on why I enjoyed it but didn\'t love it.

Therefore this little book intrigued me. It is a simple book but is great for under 3\'s and I would say probably for older children but in a different ways. Younger children will love the bright pictures and will want to look at these. It will also introduce them to the concept of time at an early age.With older children I would develop the basic premise. As well as talking about time I would also ask them what they did at each place. What did Carmi the Cat do with each of the animals he visited. In this way older children could also develop their ability to tell stories. At the back there are two pages of activities. Obviously this is one for the paperback, rather than the kindle version. You could, however, recreate your own.I love this little book.

I became so wrapped up in Breathe Again that it became nearly impossible to put it down.  These characters will play with your emotions.  I was a hot mess of laughter, tears and love throughout this book. Tate is beyond hunk-a-licious.  He could alternate between adorable, sexy and maddening, but so lovable.  Sav is one strong, opinionated but not afraid to show her emotions and stand up to Tate.  I love the fact that she stands up for herself but also has an air of innocence about her.  Tate and Sav are one of my all time book couples. They are sweet, sexy, and lovable.Now to what I didn&#8217;t like- CHELSEA.  Ugh.  If I never have to read about her again , it will be too soon.

On a night off he visits a brothel and when he chooses Annie from a line up of hookers, she recognises it as her final chance to be rescued, so she risks everything and tells him her name, in the hope that he will save her.&#34;My name is Annie Hamilton. I\'m an American citizen. I was kidnapped from a cruise ship five years ago. You\'re my last hope. Please save me.&#34;Never a man to walk away from somebody in need, or from a challenge, Patrick can\'t help but return to Annie, despite the trouble it could cause for him, in an attempt to return her safely to her parents in America, who had all but given up hope of ever seeing her again.\'They had once been little girls playing make believe, dreaming of princes and castles. But I was no prince. I\'d done enough life saving in my time and I\'d learned the hard way that I couldn\'t save them all.\'Now, I was so excited to read this book. It isn\'t often that a book can totally grip me from a blurb alone. Usually it\'s the hype surrounding the book, the recommendations through word of mouth, reviews from trusted sources, etc. But with this book, I read the book and I had to read it as soon as I could get hold of it. And I have to admit, I was pretty disappointed.This could have been sooooo good. This could have completely blown my mind, broken my heart, made my pulse race, made me cry, filled me with adrenaline and made a huge mark on this indie romance community. But it didn\'t. It was short, quick, a bit rushed and just not nearly as hard-hitting as I wanted it to be. Everything was wrapped up pretty swiftly, there were no big climaxes, no complications to navigate... Find girl, save girl, bring girl home, get together with girl, the end. It just kind of fell a little flat, really.Invincible is told from Patrick\'s POV. Now, one thing that I felt this book could have really benefited from was some scenes from Annie\'s POV. How great would that have been? To get inside her head, see what she\'d been through. I wanted to be shocked and horrified. I wanted to be as desperate for her liberation as she was. But as we didn\'t really get to know Annie until she free, I really wasn\'t too fussed either way. She was just a statistic to me, albeit one that gives really good head and has an alien tattoo on her ankle. Not really grounds for heartfelt emotional investment in a character.&#34;For five years, I\'ve head on to this fantasy that I\'d be rescued. I prayed for you, I\'ve dreamt of you. I just knew you were sent for me. You are my only hope.&#34;And then, once she was free, (which actually seemed like a pretty painless rescue mission to me... although I\'m no expert on rescue missions, so y\'know, I could be wrong) I really felt she got over the whole ordeal rather too quickly. Here is a girl who has been sold as a sex slave, passed from place to place, raped and violated repeatedly, been forced to engage in all kinds of unmentionable, unimaginable things at the hands of the absolute scum of society. She\'s been forcedly addicted to heroine, using the drugs to numb her pain and as the only form of release, she\'s lost the only friend she had whilst in captivity, lived in complete squalor, stripped of her identity... I mean, she\'s been in the epitome of living hell for five years. I\'d imagine it is virtually impossible to fully recover from this kind of experience. And Annie kind of just slips back into society quite neatly, with the exception of some cold-turkey induced tantrums whilst she detoxes. I just felt like it would have been really fascinating if the author had explored the huge obstacles Annie had to face when returning back to America after such a traumatic ordeal. But she didn\'t.&#34;You aren\'t invisible - you\'re invincible.&#34;Again, this was just one way that this book felt far too rushed. And then there was the ending which really took the biscuit... *looks shocked* I just felt like the author got a bit bored with writing and just went \'Ah, that\'ll do.\' For me, it wasn\'t a satis','Didn\'t Meet My Expectations'),(1214,'2014-04-08 00:00:00','B00IX4ET2A',5,'A1ADRRKARO0DKB','I have to say wow when it comes to this book.

It was a great romantic escape. It had all the things I love in a romance: unexpected and twisting plots, detente and intrigue, romance and of course, a sexy hero. It took a long time for Lady Henrietta and Lord Vaughan to find their happy ending. I liked the primary characters. Henrietta was spunky and intelligent, a trait I often find lacking in stories with women of this time period.  I was fully prepared to dislike Vaughan due to the fact that he had a mistress but I just could not keep from liking him - I do love a good bad boy. ;)I enjoyed Ms. Walters easy to read pacing, the clarity of her plot and the individuality of her characters.

I have had some friends that have had some success in this field working from home and working for themselves and they seemed pretty happy with their lifestyle. Knowing the high risks involved with day trading I wanted to gather some additional information than what I had gotten from my friends.  I really liked how the book didn&#8217;t just explain about the dynamics and fundamentals of day trading but went into detail about how your home office should look and feel so that it puts you in the best mind set, minimizes the stress, and is free of distraction as well as the importance of writing a business plan and how to do it for your day trading business. Just because Day Trading is the most standard type of self-employed business you need to treat it like any other business and business venture. As I am learning from the few books I&#8217;ve been reading about trading practicing is the most important thing and day trading is no different. The book described how you can practice with trade simulators which allows you to practice in real time without the money and risk and from these platforms results should be analyzed and learned from it by developing a strategy that works for you and sticking with it. Another interesting point that was made in this book is that not all day trading is high risk such as with market making which will be something I will look more into since I&#8217;m not a super highly risky person. I&#8217;m really glad I read this book.

What happened?  That he wants to &#34;teach lessons&#34; presumes that these girls are &#34;bad&#34; when in actuality they were thrust into situations that were out of their control.

I was there with Autumn through her school years feeling every taunt and bite, every time something else happened. Bullies are bullies wherever you go, and wherever you go there are bullies, now as an adult and a stronger person I want to stand up and say no more but as a student I felt like Autumn powerless.

None of these memes actually advance the story, and they invoke a right-wing creepiness that wasn\'t apparent in the first book.No need to read any further books in the series; I\'ll wish Kyle and his family well and continue to wonder why a guy who works for a power company can\'t figure out ways to get at least some power restored.','Not as good as the first, and too many stereotype memes'),(1249,'2014-04-15 00:00:00','B00JJZLJRU',5,'A1CGO9N0UIOOFY','What a super book!

I absolutely love the Destined Series by Ashley Suzanne, and reading Epiphany brought out so many emotions for all of the characters. Epiphany is the last book in the series, and as much as I don&#8217;t want to let these characters go, I absolutely loved how this series ended.Skylar and Mira are the main characters in Epiphany, most of the book revolves around them, but don&#8217;t worry we still get Danny, Jacoby, and Kylee are all there too. I loved looking back at some of the things that happened in previous books with the glimpses that Ashley provided us throughout, but not being stuck re-reading chapters of the previous books, just enough to remember why you loved (or hated) these characters so much.Skylar is still hot as ever, and I absolutely love him, but a few times in the first half of this book, I&#8217;m like WTF are you doing dude?! DO NOT RUIN THIS! And Mira is Mira, crazy, fun, passionate, and crazy in love with Skylar. I love her character and she reminds me so much of myself, well not the whole falling in love with my fiance&#8217;s best friend (Mirage) thing, but the rest of her personality, yes. And Mira and Skylar together, OMG, they are hotter than ever. I loved the scene on the motorcycle in the rain.. ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT! And will probably never look at my husbands bike again without thinking of the things that can be done on it ;)Something great happens to Skylar and Mira and then it turns horrible. I think Ashley did an amazing job of describing what Mira goes through during this part of the book, because it is very honest, and you feel her pain and everything else she is going through, during this time in the book.I loved how this story, well the whole series really, grabs you and doesn&#8217;t let you go till the last word. Epiphany is no exception to this, it is amazing, but instead of screaming &#8220;WTF Ashley why did you screw with my head?!&#8221; after finishing it, you are brought to tears, well at least I was. Between everything that happened in the book, and knowing it&#8217;s the last of these amazing characters that I truly love, it was just an emotional last few paragraphs for me.The Epilogue of this book is what really did it for me, seeing how everything ends up years down the road, it was just the perfect ending to the perfect series. Seeing these characters grow through out all of the books, and especially this one, was amazing. These characters are ones that will stay with you long after the book is over. You&#8217;ll always love Mira and Skylar, half an on/off relationship with Danny, and wish for a best friend as amazing as Kylee.If you haven&#8217;t read this series, your are missing out. There should be nothing stopping you now that all of the books are released (or soon to be released). These characters, the twists in the plots, the friendships, the writing, everything about this series and this book are superb, and I loved each and every one of these books more and more as I made my way through the series.I am not one to re-read books a lot, but this series, this series, will definitely be on my list of books to re-read, so make sure you are adding this one to your TBR list. You definitely do not want to miss out on this amazing series by Ashley Suzanne.

The focus of the story is on environmental activist Cassidy and Alaskan logger Teague Whetman. Cassidy is determined to shut down his operations in Alaska but is unprepared for the storm that rages outside and inside of her heart.Written from alternating first person POV (Cassidy and Teague) the premise follows Cassidy as she leaves the warmth of hometown San Diego behind landing in the wilds of Alaska preparing to protest against Whetman Logging. When a fierce winter storm shuts down everyone and everything Cassidy finds herself a reluctant houseguest of the man whose business she was targeting.  Enter one angry moose, an avalanche, eight feet of snow, power outages and a shortage of food -Cassidy is definitely out of her element.The attraction between Cassidy and Teague is immediate.  Near frostbite, a concussion and a raging moose push Cassidy and Teague closer together but Cassidy is left struggling between her beliefs and her attraction to Teague Whetman.  Cassidy&#8217;s eyes and her mind will be open to the possibilities that not all logging is an environmental catastrophe waiting to happen. Without controlled logging, many people (and animals) would never survive.Jen Greyson pulls the reader into a winter wonderland of ice and snow. From the darkened forests of Alaska and the men who work and live the terrain, SNOWED UNDER  is a romantic storyline about two people who would never have met under any other circumstances until a feisty one woman protest tugs at the heart of a man who has been without a woman for a very long time.I was gifted a copy','3.75 romantic stars'),(1281,'2014-05-07 00:00:00','B00JYRL694',4,'A3DHAPM8LB4JYY','This book has helped me learn and start applying self development in my life.

It had a nice flow and it really never lagged. My problems with it though came from the main characters relationship. For me there was no chemistry. I couldn\'t see how a lawyer would be all that interested in not only an  ex con but also someone who hadn\'t finished high school. I mean, what do they even talk about?  At one part of the story this 40 year old lawyer and 27 year old ex con were discussing their high school years. It didn\'t seem practical to me and grasping. The only thing the ex con could talk about was gardening, lattes, and high school. There was nothing pointing to mutual interest except the sex and since I couldn\'t fit them together in my head, the sex didn\'t go anywhere with me.  Now if they were just having sex and a complete focus on their attraction, them maybe. But there were complete sections of them just talking. Hmmm. About what?  No direct mention about what. The author couldn\'t even come up with anything except for one point mentioning that they talked about high school. Hmmmm. Yeah. It. Didn\'t. Work.Then there was the sections about the law and crime fighting. There was a judge, A JUDGE, who rolled over on his Miranda rights and talked. What judge who knows the law would do that?  That was just one example. There were many many instances where I\'m like, I don\'t think that can happen. For instance, can someone seriously be sent to jail without a trial, without testimony, without anything?  The key witnesses weren\'t even all questioned. I mean,I know that there are situations where the system doesn\'t work but one without even a trial over the death of the son of a judge?  And the media wouldn\'t be interested in any of that?Yeah, so this story was ok. I won\'t be rereading it. But it did hold my interest as long as I kept myself distant enough not to be annoyed by the aspects that didn\'t add up.  I don\'t think it was worth the money I paid for it though.

When I found out that there\'s actually a follow-up, I was so excited to read it. Book 1 was deep, emotional and very real so to have a follow-up to that is such a wonderful thing. I mean, after reading Man of My Dreams I have this idea and question in my head in how Mia & Declan can move past what happened? It\'s a big work and maybe a difficult one and that question was answered in this book.Mia & Declan did moved past what had happened and was able to find forgiveness and acceptance and was able to move forward to a more better version of themselves and their marriage but the journey is not easy. It was obvious from the first chapter of this book that they both have something to say. They need to express it & talk it out for them to really feel that they actually moved on but they were holding back. It was difficult, on both sides. Mia was full of guilt while Declan though he tries to deny is is still hurting and still has doubts. But ya know what I like about how this novella was written? Faith Andrews showed their vulnerability and doubts in the most sincere and real kind of way. True, both Mia & Declan have faults but they both recognized it and acknowledged the fact that it takes two to tango and is willing to make things work for the better and everything about the way they think and express themselves in the story is so poignant and raw. The way Faith Andrews wrote every scene is full of true emotions and you will feel it, even if you haven\'t experienced what the characters are going through you will feel it deep in your core and in your heart like you are actually feeling the same emotions. It was wonderful. Perfection.Fans of Man of My Dreams will sure love this novella. You will love it. I did. I so did. However, I want more and I don\'t want Mia & Declan\'s story to end. I hope there\'s more and speaking of more, we will have Noah\'s story. Like Faith Andrews said, he deserves one and his own HEA. There\'sno date yet and maybe Faith haven\'t even started writing it but hey, I will wait.

Jake and Lilly both have issues from their past to work through and have a hard time not only trusting each other, but trusting in themselves and the emotions they feel.  Their relationship seemed to be something of a &#34;push-pull&#34; affair - they both alternated between pulling each other in and pushing each other away.  I think this added to the personality of each character.  Both Lilly and Jake were very well-developed.  I particularly enjoyed  Lilly\'s character and her outlook on life, and she was very easy to relate to - I could see myself saying &#34;damn hair dryer&#34; since I have experienced mornings just like Lilly has.  While Jake was depicted as being a playboy, there was enough back story provided to see it was a protective mechanism so he wouldn\'t get hurt again.The story was primarily told from the perspective of both Jake and Lilly) and in the first person.  Ms. Delaney did an amazing job with the transitions between the two characters and using the first person perspective - not once was I confused as to who was telling the story, and I feel that it added more to the story to see the different ways Jake and Lilly looked at things, as well as be privy to the internal thoughts each of them have.I will definitely be reading more of Ms. Delaney\'s books.

He also explains various terms, gives readers the history of the system, tells what lenders look at in the score, and how to keep scores high. He informs readers that the more accounts that they have raises their credit score because it shows that lenders are willing to lend you money.  He reveals that lenders may see a different report than you are able to see. He also tells why credit scores determine eligibility for loans, a high score can result in a lower loan rate, and how people can secure a free copy of their rating. While a score of 720-850 is excellent, he advises that people should shoot for a score above 760.In short this is the book to use to help you improve your credit rating.','Easy to read and very informative'),(1303,'2014-07-15 00:00:00','B00K5Y8BCK',4,'A3TCEX54TCIEES','The Trap is a prequel and is a great start to what seems like it\'s going to be an emotional roller coaster of a book(Trapped).

I needed to know immediately what happened to Jayne King, Flynn McGuire, Vince, and that massive jerk hole Doyle McGuire. Queen of Hearts is full of suspense, angst that comes with two completely stubborn main characters, and off the charts steamy chemistry between Jayne and Flynn.We begin with Jayne living away from Las Vegas. She fled her life after it completely fell apart in a blaze of gunfire and deception. She loses every single person that was important to her. Going back to her hometown in Oklahoma, she tries to live a simple life complete different from her existence as a high priced call girl. As much as she tries to transform herself into a different person, her old life permeates every thought. She does find a connection with Jackson, the owner of the diner where she waitresses. He is a down-to-earth, gorgeous man who wants more from Jayne, but she is unable to open her heart to him. Flynn still weighs heavy on her heart. After receiving a visit from an unexpected person from her past, she decides to go back to Las Vegas and confront the problems and danger she desperately tried to escape.The plot line for the Queen of Hearts is more fast paced and action packed than See Jayne Play. Jayne is determined to find out what happened to Flynn, Vince, and her father, despite the attempts by her friends to stop her. I love Jayne&#8217;s tenacity. She&#8217;s a very strong willed character, something I love in my heroines. I was a bit upset with Flynn&#8217;s character at the beginning of this book. I really wanted him to step up a bit more when pursuing Jayne. But Jami redeems him in my eyes with the lengths he goes to protect her later on in the story. Vince&#8217;s character infuriated me throughout the whole book! He was secretive, combative, elusive, and just plain aggravating. I loved every minute of it! His storyline with Kelsey has me wanting more. I hope Jami continues the series with their story. I really enjoyed all the secondary characters I had one problem with this story, however. I wanted more scenes with Doyle McGuire&#8217;s character. The reader is told of all his nefarious ways, but never shown them. I would like to see his evil character in action. I think it would have really cemented his place as the bad guy in this book instead of just being told he was terrible.Queen of Heart is a addicting, fast paced read. I really enjoyed the suspense aspect of the plot. The characters are wonderfully complex and flawed. The sex scenes are romantic and steamy. I look forward to more books my Jami Denise. I give Queen of Hearts 4 out of 5 stars!Written by Dee McGee - Booze, Bookz, and Bad Boyz','Jayne and Flynn\'s riviting story continues to thrill in Queen of Hearts!'),(1318,'2014-06-12 00:00:00','B00KA0AT06',5,'AC9D9JCJJVM13','Maryann is fast becoming a favorite author of mine!!

Please be aware that there is extreme non-con in there. There is also kidnap and captivity, with violence. Antidote is extreme dark erotic romance, and will have triggers that will upset on multiple levels.My Review:MIND. FreakINGLY. BRILLIANT.IF you want to know what psychological manipulation feels like, read Antidote. If you don\'t. Don\'t.This is not a stand-alone. You must read Don\'t..., first. Then read it again before you start this one. I should have. I struggled to remember pertinent information, but either Jack L. Pyke did her job of implanting information into my brain when I read Don\'t, or she did her job of extracting what I had buried and then forced me to remember. Then she tied it all together, expanded on it, ripped it apart and created a brand new beginning.THE CHARACTERS\"I can\'t climb in to my head and order thoughts as easily as I do my sock drawer...\"Jack Harrison - We talk about broken, f\'ed up characters all the time. Jack trumps them all.\"Jan got you like that, and I f\'ing loved how even Gray was nearly caught in his gentle trap.\"Jan Richard- Vanilla, intelligent, \"normal\". His nightmare became mine. Not only does he ground this story, but he lets us see.\"Part of me swore that the search for that quiet was what drove Gray, because the moment Jack quietened, so did he.\"Gray Raoul - Complex. Dangerous. Powerful. His deeply hidden compassion almost did me in.THE STORY\"There was a brush of his nose along Gray\'s jaw for the second time now, and the need to find out the what and why behind it nearly killed me.\"I don\'t even think I can tell you anything. I\'m short changing this fascinating piece of work by not expounding here, but I fear there is nothing that I can say to do it justice. Not to mention that I\'d give something away.In generalities the book starts on a high. Things are good and this is where it must start, at a pinnacle, both because it has to give you that high to cling on to and also because it makes the depths of despair that much more poignant. There is no light at the bottom, but there is memory of it.I will just say, IF you\'re up for it, read this.THE WRITINGThe brilliance of this work comes from the way the author was able to keep me off kilter and grounded all at once. I was flailing, but for reasons. I couldn\'t put the book down. At the same time, I had to take breaks to digest, adjust, and breathe. The intensity caused me to experience real life physical reactions; racing heart rate, tears, depression, and anger. It takes a lot, any more, for me to reach that level of response to writing. It was more than just the nature of the story, it was the writing that gripped me so hard.Ms. Pyke is building something here. This book took a wild deviation from where I thought this series would go. Not in the nature of the events, but in the nature of where I thought the main players would go. This opens entirely new paths.I was struck at the end by the way the author\'s writing changed to fit the moment. It became lyrical only when it was necessary and it may have saved me. I read the last two pages over and over and over again.~ ~ ~I would like to thank Jack L.

She was willing to sleep with men to get ahead at work, and her personality was hard to warm up to.  At times she was portrayed as a strong business woman, but then she would seem weak in her relationship with Grizz.  The flip flopping made it hard to warm up to her.Grizz was another character I had mixed feelings about.  He would act like he cared about Piper but then they\'d get in a fight and he\'d go have sex with someone else.  He did try to do the right thing for Piper towards the end, which redeemed him somewhat.Both characters had tragic pasts but they were briefly discussed and didn\'t really help to explain how they made the characters the way they were.I would have liked a little more insight into the club itself.  Several members were mentioned, but there really wasn\'t an emphasis on what the club did.  Grizz would just disappear for a few days with little explanation as to why or what was happening during that time.There was a bit of violence in this story, including a rape scene.

Quinn is the Grand Master of the Warlocks & has been trying to find & destroy the Witchfinder General, who is on a mission to kill all Witches & Warlocks.  So far, the Witchfinder General has stayed one step ahead of Quinn & has evaded him with some magyck of his own.  The answer to finding & destroying him may lie in an ancient book called the Book of Shadows.  It\'s a book of spells that used to belong to a 17th century Witch, but has ended up in the hands of a beautiful seductive Witch named Valensia, who Quinn used to date years ago.  She didn\'t take their breakup too well at the time, when he told her he just wanted to date men exclusively, so he knows he may have a hard time convincing her to turn the book over to him, but will do whatever it takes.Cade, in the meantime, has been embracing his inner Sprite.  Having just found out he was Fey or a Water Sprite when he met Quinn, he wants to learn more about his ancestry & their healing powers.  He gets the opportunity to do so when he is injured & the Sprites take him away to heal him, but also teach him how to use his own healing powers.  But this puts him in danger as well, because now he\'s being tracked by a Chaser, a goblin-like creature who tracks Sprites for Collectors.

In A Bride for the Baron, governess Martha Arden visits her cousin in America while recovering from a broken engagement.  In America, she meets baron Fredrick Von Richter who was at one time engaged to Martha\'s cousin Chloe.  Both are weary of love because of past broken engagements but they quickly form a bond, a bond that is pulled into question when Martha\'s former fiance decides to win her back.I really loved A Bride for the Baron.  After reading some heavy contemporary stories lately, it is a nice change of pace to read a sweet historical romance with a bit of drama.  I also felt bad for Samuel cause he wasn\'t a true villain, just someone who made a mistake by listening to his judgmental father.

I can definitely understand why it makes it so difficult to connect with the characters. It constantly felt like I was looking at this story from the side, it didn\'t draw me in.Now in the chick-lit genre I\'ve read some crazy plot lines, so I definitely don\'t mind it being over the top as long as the author is able to make it believable. That felt kind of missing for me. Madison simply took it too far for me to be able to just go with it.Jared said he maybe had a position for Madison at his company, but she would already get paid to play his girlfriend at a family dinner. When Madison realizes there is no job at his company, she gets mad and takes revenge on him. First of all that is kind of petty. Second, the way she does that is just not funny. In front of his family Madison declares that she and Jared are getting married. Who does such a thing? They don\'t know each other, there is barely a connection and this just feels wrong to me. She involved his family and claiming you\'re getting married is a very big lie. As in when people find out, they will hate you.Of course Madison hasn\'t really thought this true, as Jared\'s aunt is really sick and she wants to see the wedding before she dies. Jared\'s aunt has been like a mom to him, so the man would do anything to make her happy, still marrying Madison might be too much. He\'s all about coming clean, but it\'s once again Madison\'s big mouth that gets them further into trouble and before you know it, she\'s trying on dresses and choosing flowers.This screamed disaster from the beginning. I had a lot of trouble liking Madison and honestly I really don\'t like her. She says and does certain things without thinking about the consequences, including the people who might get hurt. In the beginning she doesn\'t very much like Jared, but after spending two weeks with him, she\'s almost ready to really marry him. Everything definitely moved fast in this story.Jared seemed like an okay guy. He\'s the typical rich businessman with commitment issues. As soon as Madison gets in his car, he regrets bringing her along. Things just spiral downwards after that. Getting married is the last thing on his mind, though slowly Madison crawls under his skin, in a good way. I really didn\'t understand what he saw in her. These two people are complete strangers and I just couldn\'t see that connection between them.The story was also very short (188 pages) and I feel if it had been longer and things were more deepened, it would have been better. The surface was barely scratched and therefore the characters felt very one dimensional to me.Also it does switches points of view between Madison, Jared, Jared\'s dad and Jared\'s ex-girlfriend. Those last two, to me, weren\'t necessary for the continuity of the story. That she was a vindictive bitch was very easy to figure out, without needing to know her plans upfront.Overall the plot was a bit all over the place and it was hard for me to connect with the characters. I\'ve read other books, were girls need to play fake girlfriends for rich men, that were simply better than this. It\'s fun and light, but even for a short read it lacks depth for me.*I received a copy through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review*','Fun and light, but lacks depth'),(1359,'2014-06-07 00:00:00','B00KU28VCW',5,'A2ABNGB7OPDT7Q','This story will be a highlight of the year for my kindle.

If I had it to do over, I would have read something else on my &#34;to be read&#34; list.The female protagonist, Autumn, was an uptight, prudish librarian with a stick up her ass. While many authors are able to take such a character and make their antics comical or endearing, this author did neither.  The male lead was also unimpressive. He was an arrogant, sadistic, ass that got off on toying with Autumn under the guise of conducting research for his latest novel. Any attempt to portray him as a sexy, dominant alpha-male fell short by miles.What you\'re left with is 2 characters that you don\'t like, a predictable plot and so-so sex scenes.

Her mother is concerned; her father is off on another campaign trip for the up-coming election. We learn quickly that Mira has a gift (or curse). Whenever someone makes skin contact with her, she receives an instant zap of all their memories. The only person immune to her powers is her father.We enter Mira\'s world, one with a loving mother, never home father and a body guard on constant alert. Mira\'s life is lonely and due to her ability, she\'s cut herself off from everyone even more. I\'ll admit, I wondered where her friends might be or at least, loose acquaintances. But at least, she does run into a wonderfully sweet guy, who accompanies her on this journey (one which her father doesn\'t instantly approve of, of course.)It was interesting to watch a main character who absolutely hates their ability. Often characters may not like it, but they at least try to use it to their advantage every now and then, where Mira does not. She also attempts to seek professional help and is willing to open up to Dr. Walsh, which was also a nice and interesting twist. Even better, Dr. Walsh believes her, an act which doesn\'t completely shut Mira out from the world.I found the inner-contrast in Mira very interesting. She\'s willing to try to commit suicide twice to escape her ability, but on the other hand, is a strong person, ready to take on a powerful opponent when the need arises. She has strengths and weaknesses, both which make her a very sympathetic and realistic character.The world and plot surrounding Mira deepens quickly, making the story run along at a nice pace. There\'s plenty of emotion, mystery and adventure, which tended to remind me of scenes from the movie Die Hard. I couldn\'t help but smile at the end chase---although it was really tense!I had no problem connecting to the characters and was glad to see a hero, who is heroic without being overly dashing, overly strong, or overly anything. He\'s simply sweet, nice and totally lovable.In other words, I recommend this to YA Urban Fantasy fans, who like a bit of romance (but not too hot), a mystery with twists and turns, and actions scenes with a few explosions.','A Nice Twist'),(1371,'2014-06-23 00:00:00','B00L5F13V4',5,'A1QVOV1L6ZJXG4','Oh my goodness I loved this book by Author Emerald Barnes.

I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking to find peace in their life.','Aura Balancing'),(1385,'2014-07-23 00:00:00','B00LK5BO1S',5,'AZRFJMX7PLZOP','After escaping the Queen Viper&#8217;s hold during one of The Viper Rooms grand party, Joely and Jace manage to start a life together on the run. Moving from place to place, never stopping in one city or country for too long. Their peace seems to be a godsend, and the couple take advantage of the calm. But just when everything seems to be going smoothly, Clara strikes and rips Joely & Jace&#8217;s world to shreds.Back in Clara&#8217;s grasp, Joely has to do one thing&#8230; survive.I love the way we&#8217;re led into this second installment of the Viper series. After the stressful and dangerous game Jace & Joely play with Clara in the first book, it&#8217;s hard to see any type of future for those two. Yet, the start of The Runaway Viper fills the reader with a sense of hope for them. They&#8217;re given a moment to breathe, relax, and not have to constantly be looking over their shoulder. But don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re off the devil&#8217;s radar just yet! There\'s still that underlying fear and resistance to completely succumb to bliss, because Clara is still out there.Hunting and plotting.I could feel every emotion Joely was going through. I was just as anxious to find out what was going on with the club. I empathized with her when Clara stole her love away. A lot of emotions stir up from this book, and a lot of that emotion is raw and painful to read through. You can&#8217;t help but feel those tragic moments that J&J; spend apart as much as the beautiful seconds they spend together. Every word they speak about each other goes right to the heart.There was a good amount of time where Joely got reacquainted with the pit and I&#8217;m convinced it drove her a bit mad. Things that she said and her reactions weren&#8217;t sensible or beneficial. One scene in particular had me bug-eyed in shock and confused at her feelings toward the situation. I just had issues with the way she acted at times. With the treatment she was being given, who could blame her for going a little bonkers.&#8220;Clara may want me broken, but some parts of me are so impenetrable now, even she won&#8217;t win.&#8221;Overall I really liked the pacing of the novel, though it did seem to drag on a bit in the middle, that just adds to the empathy the reader feels for Joely. There were fast paced moments and then some calm ones.The end left me with a sense of fear. For Clara that is!Jace and co. have something up their sleeves and they&#8217;re not even close to being finished with the Viper Queen. I&#8217;m eagerly anticipating the final showdown for these characters in the third book, The Viper&#8217;s Bite.','The Viper Queen Strikes'),(1386,'2014-07-13 00:00:00','B00LKSISBO',5,'A17NHLASS7U6SC','this is my favorite of celias books!!! with every book she writes I feel she gets better and better!!

I appreciated the focus on an active sex life as being healthy. So important for relationships! The book explains that taking your time is key and when you think about it, time is something we all have less of. Like anything else, the book shows you how making sex a priority instead of afterthought is key to developing your relationship. The author writes very respectfully towards the reader so I have no problem recommending it.','This is a solid book based on science and emotion.'),(1388,'2014-07-13 00:00:00','B00LLK9SG0',5,'AUYU7RWJKXQXY','What a great collection of twisted, dark-humored suspense thrillers!

One wanting to scream it from the roof tops. The other one wants to keep it a secret for their own selfish reasons. It\'s about 2 people being apart for 8yrs. Now, that they are seeing each other again after so long what comes next? This is my 1st book by Louise Bay. I definitely would read her next.Ava Elliot & Joel Wentworth have never had a easy relationship. They met in college. Ava and Joel had the same group of friends. But, it was there time spent in the library studying that changed everything. They finally gave into temptation after awhile. The funny thing was is that is wasn\'t Ava making Joel wait. Joel made Ava wait until she knew that this is what she wanted. Joel never hid his feelings for Ava. So, when they finally committed to each other it was for infinity. For forever. So, what\'s the problem? Ava!! Ava was the problem. Joel wanted to let all their friends know that they were together & happy and in love. Ava on the other hand had a weird way of thinking. She didn\'t think she was pretty enough for Joel. Ava thought once everybody found out they were together that people would talk Joel into doing better.No matter how much Joel told her he loved her. No matter how much he showed her. It was never enough for Ava. He could never touch her or stand too close to her in public. I felt so bad for Joel. I can not tell you how many times I yelled & cursed at Ava while reading this book! Here she has a man who can legitimately get any woman & is destined to do big things loves her with everything he has. He wants to scream from the highest rooftop that he loves her. Yet, she somehow makes him agree to wait until after her final exam to tell their friends.Now, that finals are a week away Ava is wondering what Joel\'s plans are after they graduate. All of their friends have said what they are all doing. Ava herself has everything planned out. Everybody has discussed what\'s next except for Joel. Ava decide\'s to ask. Joel lets her know he\'s got this awesome opportunity to go to New York for a year. Joel asks Ava to go with him. To defer school & her internship for the year. After discussing it with her parents she decides to stay.Now, 8yrs later and Joel is moving back to London. Ava has managed for the last 8yrs to avoid Joel every time he\'s come back to visit their friends. Not only has she managed to avoid Joel like the plague she has also never dated anyone in that time. Ava\'s life has revolved around work and not much of anything else.Ava has had this imaginary relationship with Joel. Her heart has and always will belong with him. Yet, Ava is afraid his heart is with someone else. Ava talks her friend Jules into getting her on a dating website to get her mind and heart off Joel.Now, with Joel back in town the old gang is back together. They are back to getting together for dinner. Going out to the bars. Yet Ava and Joel never seem to speak to each other except for a &#34;Hello&#34; &#34;How are you&#34; &#34;Good bye&#34; thing. And, that literally drove me insane!!It wasn\'t until Joel showed up at Ava\'s doorstep that the present got good. He was there demanding answers. Finally!! He also gave her a time frame. 1 week. Ava had 1 week to prove to him she was ready for a relationship. A public one. Not behind closed doors. But, to let all their friends & anyone else around that they were together. It was all or nothing!I\'m so glad the story went back & forth from past and present time frames. It really filled in their complete story. Seeing them falling harder  and harder for each other was nice. Because, they really genuinely did love each other. I just wish Ava wasn\'t so worried about what everyone else thought and went with her heart. Because, they spent more time either hiding or alone. There was so many unnecessary things with them that never should of happened.I was so pissed from the start of the book to the end of the book in the present time. For the first 72% of the book in the present time that Joel & Ava didn\'t speak! There was too much description and not enough dialogue. I felt like the book could of used more conversation\'s between the characters. And, I am sad Ava & Joel didn\'t get anywhere in the present until 72%.I did love all the characters in this story. I loved how they all remained fri','&#10031;&#10031;4 Shiny Stars!!&#10031;&#10031;'),(1397,'2014-07-21 00:00:00','B00LTZF72G',4,'A1K17SX0H0F9XX','**I received a complimentary copy in exchange for a honest review**My star rating: 4/5This was a really fun book.  Emma was intelligent, witty, and relateably insecure...even if she is a little odd.  Her personal journey through the story was gripping.  I loved that we never knew who the water was going to send Emma to deal with next.  Abby was my favorite secondary character for sure; she allowed us to really see the depth of Emma\'s nurturing spirit.  Ms. Noser\'s writing was clean, though more on the young adult level than new adult.  College life was explored thoroughly, an area typically left lacking in paranormal new adults, which I loved.  I will say there probably could have been a half-dozen or so less chapters.  There was a lot of filler that I found myself skipping over.Mary BernsenAuthor of Healing The Bayou and The Villain\'s Love Series','Fun read'),(1398,'2014-07-22 00:00:00','B00LU2DW0M',5,'A3A6C58USZGUY6','Shy of Tomorrow is an amazingly beautiful read.

I love all of Scarlett Dawn&#8217;s work.  This book was very easy-to-read.  I didn&#8217;t have any problems with the new world and the different species.  My heart broke for both Braita and Jax when they were chosen to go to the planet of the Mian&#8217;s.  They were basically sent to be slaves after a tsunami wiped out there city on the planet they escaped to when the Earth fell.  I felt so much anxiety not knowing what would happen to them.  I hated their President for failing to tell them the terms of their new lives.  I was relieved when Braita started her new life with Leo and Malik.  I just knew they&#8217;d take care of her.
